0.16s: Has there ever been a situation that you
1.84s: were in where you've gotten confirmation
5.84s: of government's involvement with human
8.80s: alien hybrids?
11.44s: Yes.
 Okay.
13.68s: From a credible source, you could say
15.76s: yes.
 They know about the hybrids.
 Yes.
 I
18.80s: mean, gun to your head right now, you
20.08s: would you would say absolutely.
21.84s: Absolutely. Yes.
 They were able to
24.72s: collect DNA from aliens. John Ramirez,
29.04s: former CIA officer, 25 year career. CIA
33.44s: had a program to trace this alien DNA
 in
39.12s: certain families and particularly their
42.08s: children were of interest to CIA.
 The
45.20s: CIA was tracking the activity of
49.84s: hybrids, human alien hybrids in the
52.32s: United States. that and going back in in
54.88s: their lineage
 in that 25 years.
 Did you
58.08s: encounter anyone you knew for sure was
62.56s: read into one of the deeper programs?
67.84s: Yes.
 Did you have a lot of interactions
70.56s: with this person?
 Yes, I did.
 My name
72.48s: was submitted for that particular
74.40s: compartment
 and the Pentagon came back
76.00s: and said, "No, we're not going to read
76.88s: John Romero's into that." No way.
 You
79.04s: specifically
 You specifically cannot be
80.64s: rated. He said, "You don't understand,
82.24s: John. This program is the highest secret
88.40s: top secret in the entire United States
90.72s: government. This top secret information
93.92s: exceeds that of Manhattan Project." His
97.28s: um branch uh
 did operations under the
100.64s: sea, retrieving things.
 Bob, one of my
103.20s: engineers, was looking at one of the
104.80s: manuals was that thick, and he left that
108.16s: on his desk. The title was UFO
110.16s: Propulsion Systems, Manual of
111.68s: Operations.
 We were flying something
114.72s: that wasn't a satellite.
 What did it
117.52s: look like?
 It looked like an egg. I
120.16s: personally had only one I would call bad
123.44s: but not demonic experience. And that
126.40s: experience was with a reptilian like
129.36s: being that showed up in in my condo when
132.96s: I lived in Washington DC. And the other
135.20s: I can't identify because it was
136.80s: shrouded. It was wearing a cloak.
 A
138.88s: hood.
 A hood. Yeah. A cloak and a hood.
142.16s: And they showed up one night and they
143.84s: just I woke up cop and they go, "Oh,
146.24s: don't don't mind us. We just want to let
147.92s: you know that we know you moved."
150.88s: And then I went to medical services.
 I
152.96s: had something done here.
 And can I get
155.44s: those records? I said, "Sorry. Um,
 your
158.88s: medical records are classified. You
161.60s: cannot have them."
163.92s: Okay. Wait, they classified your own
166.88s: medical records?
 Implants are real.
169.12s: Yeah,
 it's not a conspiracy theory. And
170.96s: hybrids are real. That's not a
172.48s: conspiracy theory.
174.43s: [Music]
180.08s: Hi, Chris. Uh, my name is John. When I
182.32s: was like really young back in 2003, me
184.88s: and my friend were shooting um BB guns
186.88s: and pellet guns in his backyard and in
188.96s: Mission Viejo. It was during the middle
191.20s: of the day probably around 11:00 noon
193.60s: and this golden
196.96s: glowing almost like eggshaped
201.12s: something and it had an aura around it.
204.00s: It was also eggshaped like sitting
206.40s: upright and it was about the size of a
208.96s: Volkswagen bug and it was floating over
212.16s: my friend's house really slow and I
215.84s: wasn't afraid of it. I saw my friend saw
218.16s: it. Um, of course, back at the time, we
220.80s: didn't have cell phones to take pictures
222.48s: of it. So, I told him to run inside,
224.08s: hurry up, grab a camera, grab a camera.
225.84s: And he didn't have one, unfortunately.
229.80s: [Music]
245.41s: [Music]
256.64s: Ladies and gentlemen, today I am joined
259.44s: by the incomparable uh John Ramirez,
262.24s: former CIA officer, 25 year um career
267.28s: with the CIA, which is incredibly
269.52s: impressive. There's a lot of things that
272.08s: I'd like to talk to uh you about today.
274.40s: A lot of things that I refrained
275.76s: mentioning while we were having
276.80s: interactions in the last, you know, 24
278.72s: hours because I wanted to save it for
280.80s: here. Uh but I appreciate you coming
282.88s: into the skiff and welcome.
 Well, thanks
285.60s: very much, Chris, for having me here.
287.20s: I've seen your podcast uh myself and I I
290.88s: really like the way you conduct
292.24s: interviews and I really love all of this
295.44s: I would call it lab equipment. Yeah,
297.36s: this is very similar to what I had in my
300.40s: electronic intelligence lab at CIA
302.64s: headquarters with the addition of
304.56s: receivers and other signal processing
306.88s: equipment, but basically you have all of
308.96s: the components required to do signals
311.36s: analysis right here. That's interesting.
313.92s: I noticed you gravitating towards this
316.24s: uh yesterday as I gave you the tour of
318.56s: the office and you like a moth to a
321.36s: flame came right up to these things. You
323.28s: were able to recognize a lot of the
324.72s: equipment. So, you know, as as much as
328.48s: this is purely aesthetic, you know, for
331.52s: uh for this podcast, I'm glad to know
333.52s: that in the event where I needed to do
335.68s: signal analysis, it could come in handy.
338.24s: And if you need a signals analyst, I'm
340.32s: here.
 All right. Well, hired. Definitely
342.56s: hired. Um John, I'd like to maybe for
346.24s: the audience at home, just if you could
348.80s: give me the brief sort of pitch of what
352.72s: you did at the CIA. um what your job was
356.48s: and how you got interested in the
360.08s: UFO/UAP
361.92s: phenomenon. Uh within that, you know,
364.88s: context,
 I was a uh electronic
367.68s: intelligence analyst uh elint
372.00s: el. And that's one of the branches of
374.48s: signal intelligence or sigant. And this
377.76s: branch of sigant deals with radar
380.32s: signals uh signals coming from missile
382.96s: seekers. uh signals associated with
384.96s: weapon systems. So the purpose was to
388.56s: collect and analyze these signals,
391.76s: process the signals and then to be able
394.32s: to determine the capabilities of a
396.48s: weapon system just based on the signals.
398.64s: So in that sense we were reverse
401.20s: engineering the weapon system just based
403.68s: on the capabilities of that system to be
406.32s: able to detect, track and engage
409.52s: targets. target being if it's an
411.92s: adversary adversary system, it will be
414.72s: our planes for example. And so that's
417.04s: very valuable in the determination of
419.36s: what kind of counter measures we need to
421.12s: deploy in order to defeat an adversar's
424.40s: ability to detect our aircraft
 and to
427.60s: keep our aircraft safe. So that was just
430.24s: a um in a short uh description, that's
433.84s: what I did.
 Wow. Now, as to how I got
437.04s: involved with UFO UAP topic, um the el
442.24s: uh discipline has very little to do with
444.96s: UAPs, UFOs. However, the systems that I
448.64s: was assigned
450.32s: uh did detect an anomalous uh signatures
455.36s: when they were tracking ballistic
457.12s: missiles of their own manufacturer. Uh
460.64s: they were accompanied by uh strange
463.76s: lights uh strange objects.
 Tagalongs.
466.32s: Tagalongs. Right. And they were called
469.04s: uh the domes of light phenomenon
472.40s: by FTD back in the day. And so when the
476.16s: Soviet Union would launch a ballistic
478.32s: missile test, uh these domes of light
481.36s: would accompany the missile. And uh so
485.28s: that was very similar to uh what
488.00s: occurred with uh for example the Atlas
492.24s: launch that uh Bob Jacobs talked about.
494.88s: Hair's going up on the back of my neck
496.16s: right now. Thinking about it, just
497.84s: remembering that day, I saw something
499.60s: that was so strange that it changed my
501.20s: life.
 In November of 1964, Jacobs was
504.72s: assigned to film a Vandenberg missile
506.64s: launch using a brand new
508.64s: state-of-the-art telescope developed at
510.56s: Boston University.
512.56s: Something flew into the frame. What I
515.52s: saw was a circular object was a classic
519.20s: flying saucer and it shot a beam of
522.08s: something or a warhead. You have to
524.72s: imagine this thing is flying along at
526.08s: several thousand miles an hour. This
527.52s: stuff is flying along and something
528.64s: comes into the frame and chasing it.
 The
530.72s: flight was disrupted and uh parts of the
533.20s: missile was destroyed.
 So it's similar
537.20s: to what we saw in the Soviet Union. And
540.88s: so uh I was assigned a particular radar
545.44s: in the Soviet Union that was very unique
548.72s: to the Soviet Union and we found out
551.52s: that the purpose of the radar was
554.00s: atmospheric anomalous research.
557.44s: So the waveforms were completely
560.32s: different from any other Soviet uh air
564.16s: defense system or ballistic missile
565.92s: defense system.
 And that you mean that
567.76s: they were made to detect? They weren't
569.68s: made to detect anything that was
571.60s: standard, the wave system that you're
573.92s: that you're referring to.
 Uh, no,
576.48s: because there were other radars on that
579.12s: test range that were more like what they
581.28s: deployed,
 right?
 This system was never
583.44s: deployed operationally other than at
585.76s: this location.
 Wow.
 And so this radar uh
591.28s: to this day is still operational. And it
594.24s: did uh was it was ignored um primarily
598.88s: after the Soviet Union fell. Um less and
601.76s: less testing was done and uh it wasn't
604.48s: really used that much until about 2016.
608.00s: I understand that uh President Putin uh
612.24s: ordered that this radar system be
615.36s: completely renovated, refurbished, and
617.60s: brought back online.
 Wow. And I believe
619.68s: it is back online based on the overhead
622.24s: photography I was able to see uh of this
625.84s: particular radar system on Google Earth.
628.80s: Wow, that's very interesting. So I mean
633.12s: being in that position, you had a job
635.04s: that allowed you uh access to an immense
639.20s: repertoire of of intel. I mean that was
642.08s: part of your job was collecting
643.52s: intelligence. That's what the CIA does
645.84s: best.
647.68s: When you're in a position like that,
651.28s: do you sometimes come across things that
654.88s: even surprise you?
657.92s: Um, certainly. Um,
661.04s: that's the thing that an intelligence
662.56s: analyst has to do. It's part of the
664.40s: trade craft is not get trapped into the
667.84s: same old ways of thinking. Uh, we have
670.32s: to employ critical thinking. And every
672.96s: time I looked at a radar signal, I have
675.76s: to dismiss what I've seen before because
678.00s: I'm going to see something new. And it's
680.56s: particularly the radar systems we were
682.32s: looking at um were in development and
685.76s: constantly improved. And so every time
689.12s: there was a missile launch, I would look
690.80s: for those changes, detect the changes in
693.92s: the waveforms and then by detecting
696.64s: those changes and processing the
698.16s: waveforms, we could then determine if
700.32s: there is a new capability coming online
703.04s: for that particular radar system.
 So in
705.68s: that sense, yes, we had to um employ
708.88s: critical thinking and not get trapped
711.68s: into the same ways of thinking about
714.08s: that particular system. Otherwise, you
715.92s: might miss it. You might dismiss it.
717.76s: Yeah. So, you guys, we had we had chats
719.52s: about this like prior to the podcast,
720.88s: which is interesting, but like magicians
723.68s: have a lot to do with understanding
727.44s: behavioral sciences and in that we have
731.36s: to use those uh normal behaviors, so to
735.76s: speak, in our favor to create a sort of
739.84s: outcome. And that's not unlike a lot of
741.92s: the work that you guys did as well. You
744.80s: guys had to take information that, like
746.72s: you said, you couldn't treat it like
748.56s: normal information. You had to extract
750.72s: from it what you could find useful and
753.20s: then somehow use that to your advantage.
755.36s: Is that would that be fair to say?
756.72s: That's very accurate. Yes,
760.16s: that makes uh that makes you guys
761.76s: magicians or it makes me a spy. I'm not
763.52s: sure which one.
 Maybe a little both.
765.36s: Maybe a little of both. Um, so during
768.32s: your time there, I mean, obviously
769.76s: you're you're obviously looking at a lot
772.24s: of anomalous activity and anomalous not
774.32s: in the sense that it's necessarily
775.76s: extraterrestrial, but that it's new to
777.60s: you. But was there a point where you
780.56s: encountered something you thought to be
783.36s: extraterrestrial?
785.36s: Um, yes. uh was talking about this
789.12s: particular radar and
792.56s: this radar will come up and will start
797.68s: transmitting signals prior to the
799.44s: launch. So we can detect that and we
802.56s: know that the launch is being prepared
804.88s: because uh in order to fire a ballistic
807.60s: missile, you know, you have to put it on
809.52s: the launch pad and you have to do things
811.04s: to the missile um and to prepare it for
813.84s: launch. And so we have telemetry signals
816.56s: being tested before the launch. So we
819.12s: knew that something was up. And in the
820.96s: meantime, the radar was warming up, so
822.88s: to speak,
 uh going through uh a series
826.00s: of waveform modes of operation, getting
828.56s: it ready.
 And then the launch would
830.56s: happen. We would detect that uh back
832.96s: then through the defense support
834.80s: program, the DSP satellites that detect
837.52s: uh infrared signatures of a launch. And
841.20s: by comparing the DSP signatures,
845.68s: telemetry signatures um and the radar
848.88s: signals itself, uh we can primarily uh
853.60s: pretty much reverse engineer the the
855.76s: flight path. We knew we knew exactly um
859.28s: how high the missile would go and we
861.04s: knew how far it would go and we kind of
862.88s: knew the impact point and meanwhile the
865.12s: radar is operating. Um and then after
867.92s: the entire uh launch would be finished
871.12s: that is the missile impacted as planned
874.16s: the radar would gradually shut down and
877.36s: it will go through the same kind of
878.96s: pacing of shutting it down. So it might
881.76s: do a few uh waveform modes to in prepare
884.96s: to shut shut down. So we can detect
887.12s: that. But occasionally the radar would
890.72s: pick up something else and it would
892.96s: start tracking nothing that we could
895.92s: determine that there was something up
897.60s: there that was of interest to the
899.76s: Soviets up in the up in their space and
903.28s: they would start tracking objects that
905.68s: we could not determine what they were.
907.76s: Well, they were going through the same
910.08s: um iteration of waveforms as if there
912.16s: was a real object there.
 Whoa. Uh so
915.52s: that was our indication that you know
917.92s: this there's something up there that the
920.00s: interest the Russians there something up
922.08s: there to peique their interest enough
923.68s: that they will continue operating the
925.68s: radar and they probably themselves are
928.08s: wondering what's up there. Wow, that's
930.40s: so interesting that you guys were
931.68s: observing them observing something,
933.52s: right? Well,
 right. And so that's when
936.32s: FDD started analyzing, you know, what
939.20s: could possibly be and that's when they
942.24s: came up with the domes of light that
944.16s: they were actually like uh liked
947.04s: signatures,
 the orbs
 we would call orbs
949.68s: today, but then there were domes of
951.60s: light. That was the phrase that actually
954.00s: if you look up old FTD documents they
957.12s: would refer to it as the domes of light.
959.84s: Wow.
 So
 wow.
 That's when we determined
963.20s: that yeah there was something up there
964.80s: that of interest anomalous to the
968.32s: Soviets
969.92s: and that they were studying this as
971.68s: well. And later we did found out that
974.40s: there actually were something there were
977.20s: domes of light up there that we will
979.28s: call orbs. What what got what gave you
981.36s: that confirmation?
 Well, first of all,
984.16s: uh we were able to actually see these
987.12s: orbs
 visually
 um not as a photograph,
990.96s: right?
 But as measures of of intensity
993.68s: or radiance.
 Oh, actual actual like
995.92s: light signatures.
 Yes. Um so at the
998.64s: beginning uh the detection system wasn't
1002.08s: capable of imaging anything like the way
1004.64s: we would think that we can see through
1007.20s: an IR camera or something like that but
1010.32s: they would detect radians and it was
1012.56s: measured uh as watts to radian meter
1015.44s: squared and basically this just a number
1019.20s: but it would detect a series of these
1021.44s: numbers and we can determine where the
1023.52s: intensity was. So you have time on one
1026.48s: scale and intensity on the other scale.
1029.04s: And so all of a sudden the intensity
1031.20s: ramped up. There was something there
1032.96s: highly intense and then would ramp back
1034.56s: down and maybe there's another object of
1036.64s: intensity and ramp back down. Uh later
1039.36s: we had the capabilities uh capability of
1041.84s: actually imaging uh what these were and
1045.04s: that's when we start detecting orbs.
1047.92s: Wow. And uh as many witnesses of these
1051.12s: orbs would tell you, what we detected
1054.00s: through these systems
1056.24s: was an object that uh invisible light
1060.24s: 600 nanome was the wavelength and that
1063.04s: 600 nanometers corresponds to the orange
1065.60s: color in the visual range
 and we also
1068.72s: got uh scientific information as well as
1071.60s: to the radiance and other
1072.88s: characteristics of these objects.
1076.32s: Wow. Yeah. And that adds up with I mean
1080.16s: a numerous amount of cases and and um
1084.08s: experiences with craft. You know the
1086.88s: orange light were from from Travis
1089.04s: Walton to Bob Lazar to Chris Bledsoe to
1091.76s: so many others. And so what you were
1094.08s: observing was yeah the early UFOs so to
1097.28s: speak.
 Right. And what surprised us
1100.64s: though is that um we were aware of
1103.44s: structured craft. I'm pretty certain we
1105.68s: were aware of structured that is
1107.84s: something with a hard surface
 and by by
1109.44s: by you were aware of what do you mean by
1112.16s: that?
 That means there were previous
1113.84s: collections of structured craft.
 I see.
1116.24s: And of course there was a whole uh body
1119.12s: of collection from photographs by
1121.60s: civilians and other sources in the
1124.72s: government where they actually saw
1126.72s: structured craft. collections of these
1128.96s: photographs
 like McMinnville, a few of
1131.12s: those early 50s and 60s like hatshaped
1133.28s: ones and and all of those you're
1134.80s: referring to.
 Those um detections
1137.68s: occurred long after Project Blue Book
1140.88s: stopped ostensibly stopped because CIA
1143.44s: never stopped its own project to
1147.04s: investigate UFOs. Contrary to what the
1150.24s: CIA may publicly say, there was always
1152.56s: an interest in that. Um, so throughout
1156.72s: the course of studying these structured
1159.04s: craft, we had a pretty good idea of what
1161.52s: was up there in terms of something that
1164.48s: was aerodynamic. For example, something
1166.88s: that could fly in our atmosphere.
1169.92s: However, these orbs were not structured.
1172.96s: They were energy, light energy, and yet
1177.04s: they behaved as if they were structured.
1179.12s: that is they flew in a certain type of
1181.92s: trajectory, a certain velocity and they
1183.84s: maneuvered.
1185.44s: So we knew that there weren't
1187.04s: satellites. So satellites though they
1189.52s: are capable of station keeping there's
1191.68s: enough fuel on board to adjust its orbit
1194.64s: so that the orbit won't decay and they
1196.96s: can maneuver a little bit but they're
1199.44s: not going to make these 90° turns, you
1201.76s: know, and shoot straight up or anything
1204.32s: like that. Uh they won't exhibit those
1206.80s: uh five observables. Yeah,
 a satellite
1209.36s: won't do that. No,
 but these craft did.
1211.76s: And unlike um something solid like tic
1214.64s: tac, you know, these light orbs were
1216.80s: doing the same thing.
 Wow.
 So that's
1219.84s: what piqued CIA's interest. What are
1222.08s: these orbs?
1224.08s: And as we progressed in our ability to
1227.12s: detect these objects because we made
1229.92s: advances in our constellations
1232.88s: uh that we have uh up in space, we were
1236.00s: better able to actually determine the
1238.48s: characteristics of these orbs.
1241.36s: And so that led to um what I call the
1244.08s: orb working group. Now that's not the
1246.48s: official name of the working group. It
1248.40s: had a official name which I don't know
1251.04s: cuz I refused to be read into it
1253.52s: purposely. I didn't want to know. I knew
1256.00s: enough so that if I knew more than I
1259.28s: knew at that time, I wouldn't be
1261.44s: speaking with you right now.
 That's
1262.80s: right.
 I would not be talking.
 As soon
1264.48s: as you're right into it, you can't talk
1265.68s: about it.
 I can't talk about it. But
1267.04s: because I knew about it and I had enough
1269.36s: information, credible information
1271.76s: because I sent two of my engineers to
1274.00s: this working group. I got enough
1276.08s: information as to what they were looking
1277.68s: at. And so it was these orange orbs. And
1281.68s: so I got a briefing on these orbs at a
1283.84s: very lower classification level, not top
1286.48s: top secret, but much lower. And it was
1289.12s: still classified. But that's why I
1291.52s: included in my very few first view
1294.32s: graphs or I say view graphs that dates
1296.56s: me my PowerPoint presentations my
1298.48s: PowerPoint slides I included the
1300.96s: existence of the orb working group as
1303.44s: this is the way we would study orbs
 and
1306.32s: the way I describe it was the way
1308.00s: actually it happened and so I submitted
1310.40s: to CIA for their review and they came
1312.64s: back unredacted saying yeah you can talk
1314.72s: about this in public
 so that's why you
1317.44s: know that there was an orb working
1318.80s: group. Wow.
 And that started around 2003
1322.08s: 2004.
 Do you think that that orb working
1324.80s: group are of the same people that
1326.96s: studied Chris Bledso's case?
 I don't
1329.76s: have that direct information. I do I
1331.76s: don't know.
 Would you assume that?
 Uh I
1333.76s: think that's a safe assumption. Let's
1335.28s: put it that way.
 Uhhuh.
 Uh but this orb
1337.44s: working group uh included members of the
1339.60s: entire intelligence community. So
1341.76s: outside of the CIA,
 outside of CIA, NGA
1344.24s: was the lead because it was in on uh it
1347.84s: the orbs were found on NGA data
 since
1350.40s: they owned the data.
 Uh they were the
1353.12s: lead and then we participated with NGA,
1356.00s: DIA, NRA, everybody. Yeah.
 Along with
1359.52s: our contractors,
 right?
 And they met in
1362.88s: St. Louis, Missouri, which is uh NGA
1366.64s: uh NGA West. So there's two
1368.64s: headquarters. One is NGA East back in
1372.00s: the Washington DC area and they're in
1373.68s: Springfield, Virginia, and the other is
1376.00s: NGA West, which is in St. Louis,
1377.92s: Missouri.
 So, they all gathered in St.
1379.92s: Louis, Missouri, and then went to other
1381.60s: places as the working group progressed.
1384.64s: That's very interesting. It's really
1386.32s: interesting to know that like even for
1388.96s: an agency like the CIA,
1391.92s: the nuts and bolts stuff, they're like,
1394.08s: "No, we understand that. We have that."
1398.24s: Yes. This stuff is anomalous. And it
1401.60s: often makes me wonder if there if
1403.92s: there's a if there's some type of
1405.76s: extraterrestrial being out there that
1407.52s: also experiences UAP, you know, an
1410.40s: unidentified anomalous phenomenon that
1412.88s: they see and they're like, "We can't
1414.40s: explain that either." So,
 one wonders,
1416.72s: one wonders.
 And I know that uh we have
1419.44s: something um I would say this much. Uh
1423.36s: one of my engineers, uh I'll use his
1425.84s: first name. I'll just use first names.
1427.52s: These are actual first names. His first
1429.76s: name was Bob.
 U Virginia Tech graduate
1432.96s: had a masters in electrical engineering.
1435.44s: One of my uh primary engineers who
1438.16s: worked in my branch and um he received a
1442.08s: lot of materials. They I had two
1443.84s: engineers, Allan A Len, Allan and Bob.
1448.24s: So these two guys uh were sent to the
1450.24s: orb working group. They got briefed into
1452.24s: a compartment dealing with everything
1454.80s: CIA knew about UFOs. Whoa.
 At the time.
1458.32s: Whoa.
 So they got read into that.
 Um and
1462.40s: so they asked me
 You sent them there.
1464.88s: Yes, I was asked to send them there.
 You
1466.48s: were asked to send them there.
 Yes.
1467.84s: Because there was a lead uh subject
1469.92s: matter expert in our parent office who
1473.12s: was leading CIA's effort. And so he
1475.36s: reached out back into the agency and see
1477.76s: who the other subject matter experts
1479.92s: might be. And the way we got involved
1483.20s: with this prior to the working group was
1485.36s: that we were looking at the possibility
1488.80s: of it being the orbs being some kind of
1493.60s: so a Russian technology.
 Right. Yeah.
1496.64s: Russian countermeasures, ballistic
1498.32s: missile countermeasures or uh we knew
1501.52s: that the Russians had something called
1503.68s: stealth plasma stealth,
 right? And these
1506.88s: are like actual external pods that they
1509.60s: can hang on the hard points of certain
1512.00s: aircraft to create a plasma field in
1515.20s: order to do what stealth does is to
1518.24s: disrupt the uh fire control solution to
1522.32s: shoot that aircraft down.
 Mhm.
 And so
1525.36s: that's what stealth does. You don't want
1527.04s: to be shot down. So you want to either
1530.08s: uh delay that fire control solution or
1532.80s: disrupt it so that the aircraft stays
1534.96s: intact and safe do its mission.
 So we
1537.68s: knew that they had these types of
1539.12s: devices and we we ruled that out. It
1542.08s: couldn't have been plasma stealth. First
1545.44s: of all what we detected was out in
1547.68s: space.
 Oh.
 And so these aircraft they
1552.00s: don't fly in space.
1554.50s: [Music]
1560.80s: Most days I'm neck deep in files,
1562.80s: interviews, and
1564.96s: whatever that thing was. But not today.
1568.08s: Today's quiet. And on these quiet days,
1570.72s: I like to feel good, which is why I shop
1573.04s: Huckberry. Not to mention, they partner
1575.44s: with all sorts of in-house brands as a
1577.44s: curator of things that I would actually
1579.12s: wear and use. It just makes everything
1581.92s: easier. I know whatever I pick is going
1584.24s: to look good, feel good, and last. I
1587.68s: just don't have to overthink it. It's
1589.28s: already my style.
1591.84s: They're the one-stop men's shop for
1593.44s: highquality apparel, footwear, gear, and
1596.48s: content. A lifestyle and outdoor
1598.48s: retailer, sure, but mostly they just get
1602.32s: it right.
1606.32s: And on days like today,
1608.88s: some mysteries can wait. Click the link
1611.04s: in my description to shop Huckberry.
1620.00s: And even the MiG 31, um, it it went up
1622.88s: to 123,000 ft before it ran out of air
1626.64s: and had to come back down. So, it was
1628.08s: just a test flight just to see how high
1630.08s: it would go.
 I have no idea what the
1632.32s: condition of the pilot was, but they
1634.16s: went up to 123,000 ft. has the altitude
1637.52s: record for an air breathing craft to
1639.20s: this day and had to come back down. This
1641.52s: is a Mig 31 Foxhound. So, we knew it
1644.32s: wasn't that. Uh we looked at uh another
1646.80s: aircraft uh called the uh Sukoy SU34
1651.44s: fullback. It wasn't that. Um and so we
1656.32s: ruled out any kind of air breathing
1658.16s: aircraft that would have plasma stealth
1660.48s: on it.
 So, we knew it wasn't that. And
1662.40s: it was also moving an like uh it it was
1666.08s: moving intelligently.
 It was moving
1667.76s: intelligently. An aircraft can move
1669.36s: intelligently because it's piloted.
 But
1671.28s: but
 anomalous anomalously like it was
1674.64s: not at that altitude.
 Right. And it was
1676.48s: performing maneuvers that
 Exactly. I
1679.04s: mean it would tear the aircraft apart,
1680.72s: right?
 Uh so we ruled that out and so
1684.08s: what's left over um that's what they
1686.32s: were looking at. What could this be?
1688.48s: Mhm.
 Now, in the course of their study,
1691.12s: they asked me for a safe. So, I got them
1693.20s: a standard governmentissued safe. They
1696.24s: come in two beautiful colors. I call it
1698.48s: bureaucratic black.
1700.80s: And uh that's their one of the uh
1703.76s: colors.
 Really?
 Yeah. And uh so I got
1706.64s: him a black safe.
 That's it's a great
1709.60s: it's a great uh clothing line. Uh
1713.52s: that comes in bureaucratic black.
 Yeah.
1715.60s: Um and you get you can get a gray one.
1718.00s: government gray and bureaucrat black.
1720.00s: Government gray,
 you know, and you look
1722.16s: up at the GSA catalog and you'll see
1724.24s: these General Services Administration
1726.48s: provides furniture for the government,
1728.00s: the entire government.
 You'll see these
1729.68s: safes and has a combination lock and
1732.40s: several drawers and everything. So, I
1734.72s: got them a safe and they started getting
1737.28s: materials from this working group,
1739.52s: compartmented materials on the UFO
1741.84s: program. They had to go in the safe.
1744.32s: Now, one of my engineers when I was
1745.92s: going with this, Bob, one of my
1747.36s: engineers was looking at one of the
1749.04s: manuals. It was that thick. And he left
1752.16s: that on his desk face front just as you
1755.20s: have this folder here. And I was able to
1757.12s: read the title.
1759.12s: And it the title was UFO propulsion
1761.84s: systems.
 Whoa.
 Manual of operations.
1766.00s: So, if you have a UFO propulsion system,
1767.76s: manual of operations, that tells me that
1770.40s: somebody reverse engineered some craft
1772.72s: and it's that thick. And it's that
1774.00s: thick. All right. So,
1777.04s: I have that piece of data.
 So, what
1779.20s: happened to that? What did
 Well, uh, I
1781.20s: looked at the title. Bob had his back
1783.76s: turned. He turned around, saw me looking
1785.52s: at the title, immediately grabbed that,
1789.76s: placed it front cover down so I couldn't
1792.48s: read the cover. Sorry about that, boss.
1795.04s: And, and then immediately put it back in
1797.12s: the safe and locked it up.
 Oh my gosh.
1798.96s: So I know that they were briefed into
1802.00s: something that we already reverse
1804.40s: engineered.
 Whoa.
 So that lends lends
1806.96s: credence to a lot of witnesses saying,
1809.20s: "Yes, we have reverse engineered craft."
1811.36s: So I can say based on that manual, and
1813.44s: these weren't like uh defense
1816.40s: intelligence reference documents were
1818.64s: just like a dozen pages like white
1820.96s: papers.
 Yeah.
 No, this was a manual.
1823.68s: Whoa. Somebody worked on that manual and
1826.96s: uh it looked dated in a sense that it
1829.76s: looked like not nothing current. Looked
1833.36s: like it was like decades old.
 50s60s.
1836.40s: Well, I would say maybe not 50s.
 Okay.
1839.12s: But maybe 70s, 80s. Sure. About about
1841.76s: that time frame.
 What color was the uh
1844.72s: was the book?
 Uh it was
1848.16s: almost that color what you have there.
1849.84s: It was like a like DIA drab. There's
1854.00s: another good one.
 DIA draft. It's It's
1856.08s: like DIA published a lot of manuals that
1858.64s: are very thick.
 Mhm.
 And they come in
1860.80s: different colors. I don't know if the
1862.08s: colors mean anything.
 Yeah.
 Um but the
1866.16s: point being that it was a manual, not a
1869.36s: white paper, not a not a um
 talking
1872.16s: points or anything like that. Yeah. It
1874.00s: was a manual. Somebody did some actual
1876.16s: work on a UFO propulsion system to the
1880.72s: point that they were able to write a
1882.08s: manual of operation for it.
 That's
1884.64s: incredible and seems like an incredible
1887.28s: oversight on Bob's behalf to just leave
1889.68s: that lying around.
 Yes. And had I looked
1891.84s: into it, had I opened it,
 Uhhuh.
 I would
1894.56s: be charged with a security violation.
1896.56s: Right.
 Cuz Bob would have to he's
 he
1898.64s: would have to report me.
 But seeing the
1901.28s: title was okay. um inadvertent,
 right?
1904.56s: Inadvertent. And then he took measures
1906.24s: to to secure the
 I see document.
 He
1909.68s: would have been reprimanded anyways as
1911.36s: well, obviously. That is uh that's
1913.68s: crazy. Is there
 is there a part of you
1917.04s: that regrets not being read into that
1919.68s: like for your own sort of knowing?
 Not
1922.80s: at all. Because um you have a building a
1926.32s: CIA headquarters in our many many
1928.24s: outuildings. We're not just at CIA
1929.84s: headquarters. There are several
1930.80s: buildings in Northern Virginia that
1932.80s: constitute CIA. Um,
1936.08s: not at all because
1939.60s: I would say that being read into it um
1943.68s: would have prevented me from speaking
1945.12s: out, but we are an intelligence agency
1949.68s: and you have intelligence analysts and
1952.64s: collectors
1954.72s: working there. And what we do best is
1957.04s: collect intelligence. So, you can be in
1958.64s: the building, not read into something,
1960.48s: and be able to discern what's going on
1963.20s: if you're very clever about it. There's
1965.44s: enough
1967.12s: uh water cooler cafeteria talk that you
1970.08s: pick up on things.
 Wow.
 So, I didn't
1972.96s: need to be read into it. I knew enough
1974.72s: based on my earlier career of working
1977.28s: with these domes of light phenomenon um
1980.32s: and working with that particular radar.
1983.28s: um actually met a woman who is uh an
1986.48s: operations officer and she complained to
1988.24s: me, I got sent up to this mountain and
1990.32s: they told me to look for these domes of
1992.56s: light and I apologized to her and said,
1994.16s: "Yeah, that was us." Yeah, we needed
1997.04s: collection uh a human collection um
1999.92s: using one of our operations officers to
2002.72s: go up a mountain, set up and look for
2005.20s: these domes of light. We also had a
2007.68s: collection system we built.
 Was that
2009.60s: successful? I'm not sure because she
2011.76s: didn't tell me whether she found
2013.04s: anything or not.
 Oh, wow. So, you were
2014.56s: able to send her out, but you weren't
2015.68s: able to find out whether she saw
 I met
2017.04s: her um not as a planned meeting, but we
2020.00s: were taking the same course and the
2021.76s: course had nothing to do with UAPs or
2023.84s: anything.
 Huh.
 But she was in the same
2025.84s: course and um so she can play, you know,
2029.36s: the craziest thing I ever did in my CIA
2031.36s: career so far, and she was a a younger
2033.52s: woman uh was they sent me up in a
2035.76s: mountain. I was looking for these domes
2037.28s: of light. I don't know what that was.
2038.72s: And I explained to her, "Oh yeah, it's
2041.36s: about these anomalous objects that we
2043.28s: detected over the Soviet Union. That's
2045.44s: why you were sent out there." And I
2046.80s: apologized to her. Sorry.
 Wow.
 She said
2048.88s: that was a pretty pretty rough um kind
2051.44s: of mission for her to go on.
 Wow. So
2053.84s: strange.
 So yeah, so to answer your
2056.48s: question, I had enough information
 a a
2059.36s: priority to know that there was
2060.88s: something going on. Had enough uh
2063.20s: ability to um collect other data.
2066.88s: example, um, Russian early warning, uh,
2069.68s: ballistic missile early warning system
2071.60s: detected these these orbs and they
2075.52s: thought that it was US sneak attack and
2077.76s: so they brought up their alert level
 and
2080.00s: when they bring up their alert level, we
2081.52s: can detect the fact that they brought up
2084.24s: their alert level and you have these
2086.16s: missiles uh, that were needed to be
2089.28s: preped and so there are certain
2091.20s: indications that we are able to detect a
2094.00s: launch might be occurring. Yeah,
 it's
2096.96s: hard to hide the signature of a major
2100.48s: retaliatory strike,
 right?
 So, they were
2102.88s: prepping. They didn't go all the way up
2105.12s: to
 Defcon, their version of Defcon to
2109.36s: actually start launching, but we were
2112.48s: able to detect that. And so, because we
2114.96s: were able to detect it, uh, Washington
2117.12s: called Moscow and saying, "What the
2118.40s: hell's going on with you guys?" So, what
2120.64s: the hell is going on with you guys? What
2122.48s: are these things? And we don't know what
2123.92s: they are. So, you know, there's there's
2125.68s: a ability at the National Military
2128.40s: Command Center in the Pentagon. Yeah. To
2130.48s: communicate with their counterparts
2132.32s: because there is there is a treaty sort
2134.48s: of like an agreement in regards to
2136.96s: nuclear arms.
 Well, start treaty
 that
2140.32s: exactly that if there is any detected
2142.96s: anomalous or unidentified objects as
2146.08s: it's put in the treaty that they tell
2148.24s: each other about it instead of
2150.00s: retaliating immediately.
 Exactly. So,
2152.64s: that mechanism worked. Mhm.
 at that
2154.64s: point and they were able to lower their
2156.56s: alert level.
 But then comes the
2158.72s: question, what were those things that we
2160.96s: detected that the Russians detected?
2163.04s: Right.
 Right. And so that's when I wrote
2164.88s: the memo to uh at that time he served as
2167.84s: the deputy secretary of defense, John
2169.92s: Deutsch.
 Mhm.
 And so I wrote him a memo
2172.72s: because his briefer was asked by him,
2176.64s: we want to know what happened in this
2178.80s: particular incident. So it came to my
2181.12s: branch which looked at the
2183.04s: anti-bballistic missile systems, the
2184.96s: ballistic missile defense systems in
2186.64s: Russia.
 So it landed on my desk and I
2189.04s: wrote up the memo for uh Deputy
2191.52s: Secretary of Defense John Deutsch and um
2195.52s: we're going to give we were going to
2196.88s: give it to the briefer, but I think we
2198.96s: actually delivered it in person.
 I see.
2201.68s: My colleague and I um we delivered it in
2204.40s: person to the Pentagon,
 so they're aware
2206.40s: of it. Mhm.
 Um that's I mean that's
2209.68s: really fascinating and it seems you know
2212.40s: it doesn't it it doesn't surprise me at
2214.16s: all like when you hear about all all
2215.76s: this stuff you know as much as I want it
2217.20s: to surprise me I'm like yeah
 it's
2219.04s: obviously you know obviously if you guys
2220.80s: have the capability with all of the
2223.20s: intel collection devices that you have
2225.52s: whether it's satellite or whether it's
2226.96s: human intel or whether it's you know
2228.24s: remote viewing or whatever it is you're
2230.16s: going to see something eventually right
2232.64s: um this brings me to something that
2234.56s: happened to you in 2001 one.
 Yes.
 I want
2237.76s: to talk about this because this to me is
2239.44s: one of the most fascinating little tales
2241.84s: that I've ever heard in that you were
2245.36s: invited by, let me get this straight
2247.76s: here just to make sure I got my ducks in
2249.84s: a row. Um, you encountered an officer
2253.12s: within the office of the chief
2254.56s: scientists in the director of science
2256.00s: and technology
2257.84s: and that he told you about a symposium
2259.76s: that was being held that you should
2261.68s: attend. Mhm.
 And this symposium, if I'm
2264.80s: not mistaken, was uh at BDM.
 No.
 No.
2268.32s: Where?
 Uh this was at a hotel.
 Oh, this
2270.56s: was at a hotel.
 Yep. It's uh it's in
2273.28s: Tyson's Corner, Virginia.
 Oh,
 and um
2276.80s: Wait. Okay. So,
 this is separate from
2278.96s: the other meeting.
 I see that. That was
2280.80s: a separate meeting.
 That was separate.
2282.16s: Okay. Well, we we'll get to that one.
2283.60s: But this one at the hotel, is that
2285.36s: something standard that happens like
2287.28s: these briefings in these hotels, these
2289.04s: symposiums? is that
 hotels seem to be
2291.60s: the place to discuss this stuff. I don't
2294.24s: know why.
 Um I know Lulu Lzando has
2297.36s: stated that you know he met people at a
2299.12s: hotel.
 Mhm. Yep.
 Uh I think it was the
2302.56s: Marriott Gateway in Rosland, Virginia.
2304.72s: He mentions that one and other hotels. I
2306.72s: I don't know what it is about hotels and
2308.72s: tele community, but we like going to
2310.48s: hotels.
 Okay.
 I don't know why, but uh
2313.04s: this was an unclassified uh one day
2315.20s: symposium. I had no idea what the topic
2317.20s: was. the officer from the office of
2320.24s: chief scientist. I use first names. His
2322.32s: first name was Tom.
2324.48s: Uh I might use the last initials because
2326.24s: we usually refer to ourselves as like
2328.24s: I'm known as John R and the CIA. We use
2330.96s: first name and last initial. Tom K.
2333.84s: Okay.
 Out there Tom. Hi. But you know,
2336.72s: Tom K invited me. And uh I had no idea
2339.84s: what it was about, but he knew I was
2341.84s: interested. And how did he know? because
2344.16s: I had a plush toy of a a green bendable
2348.80s: plush toy I set up on my old-fashioned,
2352.32s: you know, CRT Dell monitor.
 Uhhuh.
 And
2355.44s: it was a gray alien, but it was colored
2357.84s: green. It was It's just a toy, right?
2359.92s: So, he knew he was interested in that.
2361.68s: And um so he invited me said, "You might
2364.24s: want to show up this one."
 Was Was he
2366.72s: interested in this stuff?
 I don't know.
2369.44s: We I never really followed up with him
2371.28s: to see what his interest was.
 Okay. Um
2373.84s: but he knew I was interested and so um
2377.36s: he ran something called the posttock
2379.20s: program at CIA where we we sponsored um
2383.44s: post-doal studies of these PhDs
2386.56s: and they were invited as well. It wasn't
2389.36s: the invisible college or anything. These
2391.36s: are just uh PhDs that CIA sponsored for
2395.92s: their PhDs and then they're following
2397.84s: through.
 Yeah.
 Possibly later to offer
2400.00s: them jobs.
 Yeah. Recruits. And that's a
2402.48s: good way to think about it.
 Yeah.
2403.68s: Recruits even like I mean you hear about
2406.00s: this and I don't want to use the term
2407.44s: grooming but it's like you hear about a
2409.44s: lot of this as well in the intelligence
2410.88s: community that they vet a lot of uh
2413.36s: young people um early on that show a
2416.64s: significant talent. Um Harold Malgren
2419.36s: being you know um comes to mind because
2422.24s: that seemed like that was his process as
2424.56s: well. So that's nothing new.
 So go to
2427.52s: the hotel
2429.20s: um up to this um ballroom. I guess you
2431.76s: would call it a conference room in this
2433.52s: hotel in Tyson's Corner and um there
2436.40s: were no security officers there look for
2440.24s: no and I just wrapped my badge up and
2442.72s: put it in my pocket because I didn't
2444.16s: need a badge to attend and I sat myself
2447.44s: down and there was an agenda being
2448.96s: passed out and a signup sheet and I
2451.20s: signed my name uh full true full name uh
2455.20s: my phone number at CIA and where I
2457.28s: worked at CIA all that it was in there.
2459.28s: looked at the other names and there were
2460.88s: like people from universities because
2464.00s: they had.edu as their email address.
 I
2466.56s: see.
 And their full names. I then
2469.28s: noticed that other than Tom K, it was
2472.64s: another officer I knew, Jim L. Jim L is
2477.04s: significant in that he chaired the
2479.28s: scientific and technical intelligence
2481.36s: committee,
 one of the major committees
2484.00s: in the
 uh back when the DCI ran the
2487.60s: intelligence community. So, this is a
2489.44s: major committee.
 Um, and he was there as
2492.32s: well and I I know him from my own parent
2495.92s: office. Um, he was there and I don't
2498.72s: know I didn't recognize anyone else. Um,
2501.36s: but
2502.88s: uh I can use his full name, John
2505.28s: Phillips. He's he's out in public as a
2507.68s: former uh chief of the office of chief
2510.56s: scientists. In fact, he was the very
2512.08s: first office of the chief scientist
2514.96s: head.
 Wow. uh before that office was
2517.92s: named something else
 and he was present
2519.60s: as well.
 He was present and he
2521.28s: introduced
2522.88s: another gentleman that I knew uh Gerald
2525.44s: K. Haynes.
2527.28s: Now Gerald Haynes is C was CIA's
2529.92s: historian. He was also in a row
2531.60s: historian. He was the run that wrote uh
2534.00s: the paper about CIA UFO interest from
2537.28s: 1947 to 1990.
 Wow.
 It's out there now. I
2540.96s: there's two versions of that. One is a
2543.52s: public version, one is a classified
2545.12s: version. I got the classified version
2547.84s: and um so he was there and he was the
2551.12s: one presenting. So he's the one that
2553.12s: presented on what CIA did with UFOs
2556.40s: going back to 1947.
 But this is an
2558.80s: unclassified setting.
 Mhm.
2562.48s: at at what point did you think that the
2564.72s: information that was being
2567.28s: um talked about
2570.00s: should be classified or unclassified?
2572.56s: Because I'm I'm I'm going to let you
2574.72s: continue the story because this gets
2576.00s: really really bizarre and it gets quite
2579.12s: um disturbing a little bit even of I'm
2582.16s: just really surprised to hear the amount
2584.16s: of people that are there that had
2585.52s: credentials like this was it feels like
2588.16s: this was of some importance at least to
2591.76s: people in positions of, you know, uh,
2594.56s: seemingly importance.
 You would think
2596.80s: so. Yes. And I don't know why I was
2598.32s: there because compared to these other
2600.00s: gentlemen, I was not that important.
2601.76s: Mhm.
 Um, but I was invited and I
2604.56s: attended and so um, the paper that uh,
2609.60s: General Haynes wrote was approved by CIA
2613.36s: because it was released and that's why
2615.60s: you have it now. You can search for it.
2617.52s: Do a Google search for it and you you'll
2619.20s: find it. So that that uncclassified
2621.44s: version is released. So he was talking
2623.28s: about that and he said something very
2625.44s: interesting. He said a lot he said that
2628.24s: when we were testing the U2 and A12 they
2631.92s: were silver
2633.92s: and they only operated in broad
2635.60s: daylight. Why was not were they painted
2639.28s: black and why not at night to hide them?
2642.32s: Simple explanation. The cameras back in
2644.72s: those days didn't have night vision.
2646.96s: Mhm. So, you know, they needed daylight
2649.60s: to photograph anything on the ground.
2651.84s: And that's how they tested the cameras
2653.36s: and the systems um in broad daylight.
2656.24s: And they're silver. You can see them.
2658.32s: You can track them. Easier to track.
 But
2660.24s: these are airplanes.
 These are Yeah.
2662.40s: advanced airplanes. U2 for 1955.
 Yeah.
2666.56s: U2 was very advanced. A12
 definitely
2669.76s: looks very advanced.
 And that first A12
2673.28s: um came on boarded uh 1962.
2677.76s: And so broad daylight and people would
2680.32s: see these objects up in the sky. They
2683.20s: were flying at 70,000 for the U2 and
2686.40s: like over around about 85,000 for the
2689.28s: A12.
2691.20s: And there was these silver streaks up in
2692.80s: the sky. Um, people were reporting UFOs
2697.36s: and when people reported UFOs to the
2699.76s: local authorities or to a radio station
2702.32s: or TV station or whatever you what have
2704.48s: you, newspapers, uh, that piqued our
2706.64s: interest. We wanted to know what they
2708.24s: were seeing.
 Mhm.
 What did you see?
2712.00s: Describe what you see. Um because we
2714.72s: don't know we wanted to know what these
2716.72s: craft would look like to an observer
2719.92s: knowing nothing about the program to
2722.24s: develop these aircraft. What are they
2724.88s: perceiving from the ground looking up?
2726.72s: Sure.
 And so we got those reports. Now
2729.44s: that started the men in black legend
2732.08s: when we were visiting the CIA officers
2735.36s: uh some of them uh showed had air force
2738.16s: credentials.
2740.00s: Mhm.
 And they were presenting themselves
2741.52s: as air force even though they were CIA.
2744.32s: This was what years? This was the ' 60s.
2746.24s: Yeah. This is like um starting from the
2748.56s: very first uh in in the 50s late 50s.
2751.44s: Yeah. Because Rex Chaplan as well is was
2753.44s: you know
 visited um by gentlemen as
2757.20s: well. So like I mean you you would
2758.72s: assume the same department that visited
2760.88s: people for explainable aerial phenomenon
2764.64s: would also be sent out when
2768.72s: UFOs were spotted. It would be the same
2770.56s: people.
 I would I would imagine so I
2772.40s: would imagine they would have a um
2774.64s: professional background
2776.80s: um in the entire topic
 because they were
2779.60s: reporting UFOs. So obviously people who
2782.64s: actually know about UFOs would find out
2784.72s: you know what did you see?
 Mhm. Um so
2787.52s: they were reporting these um aircraft as
2790.80s: UFOs. Now unlike the Air Force which
2793.84s: encourages you to believe they're UFOs,
2795.92s: CIA did not they did not dissuade their
2799.76s: belief that they were UFOs
2802.40s: and they would
2804.48s: act like muon investigators in the sense
2807.20s: that they would take in the data,
 right?
2809.04s: We just want to know what you saw. We're
2810.56s: going to take in the data. Thank you
2811.92s: very much. Yeah. Thank you for your
2813.60s: patriotism and reporting this to the
2815.68s: government so forth and so on, right?
2817.20s: Yeah.
 But we didn't
 you didn't give them
2819.68s: a cover story.
 Did not give them a cover
2821.92s: story. We just wanted to know what you
2823.44s: saw. If they saw a UFO, fine.
 Yep.
 But
2826.72s: they did. The CIA did not deliberately
2829.92s: tell people you saw a UFO,
 right? Or
2832.16s: don't say anything.
 Don't say no.
 Okay.
2834.48s: We just want the information. Um, so
2837.44s: that occurred uh throughout the 50s uh
2840.40s: during the YouTube program and through
2842.00s: the 60s up to 64 when we actually
2844.40s: deployed the A12 operationally,
 mid60s I
2847.92s: would say. Um, so that
 and that's what
2851.28s: the seminar was about up until then.
 Up
2853.12s: until then. Yeah. And so yeah, he said
2855.68s: but one in 10
2858.40s: Gerald K. Hayne said one in 10 were
2860.96s: UFOs.
2863.04s: We have case files of real UFOs that one
2866.48s: in 10 sightings
 Mhm.
 were actual UFOs.
2870.32s: That's a high number.
 That's 10%.
 Yeah.
2872.64s: Yeah. Um and so
2877.04s: going back and thinking about wow, you
2879.68s: know, the CIA knew that there was
2881.76s: something up there that were real UFOs.
2884.96s: And this is like more of the public side
2887.20s: of CIA that that it's still classified
2889.76s: side of CIA but not the program side.
2892.16s: Sure.
 Of CIA, right?
 Yeah. It's not
2894.40s: deep.
 It's not deep. It's just
2897.12s: interesting information that
 you you saw
2900.08s: a UFO and that 10% of them couldn't be
2902.32s: explained.
 Yeah.
 Um so the second part
2906.64s: of that discussion was about
2910.32s: beings
2912.32s: that there were aliens. there were
2914.40s: actual aliens and that
2917.76s: um they were able to collect DNA from
2922.56s: aliens and that's when they discovered
2925.44s: and this didn't happen in 47 happened
2928.08s: later probably they had tissue samples
2930.64s: or whatever that they've stored and they
2934.00s: were able to recover DNA and when we
2937.28s: discovered how to sequence the human
2939.20s: genome
2940.96s: and we sequenced the alien DNA and And
2943.52s: we discovered that, oh, there are
2944.88s: markers in there that look very human,
2949.36s: human hybrids. H um that what looks like
2954.00s: an alien
2955.84s: has for some reason has um human genetic
2959.92s: markers in their DNA in the genome. And
2963.84s: so I found that to be interesting. And
2965.60s: to answer your question, that's when I
2967.12s: thought this sounds pretty classified to
2969.76s: me. This is coming from a CIA historian.
2973.12s: A CIA historian. Yes.
2975.84s: Like that comes with some weight behind
2977.52s: it. This isn't going to a UFO conference
2980.72s: and and you know somebody like me going
2983.12s: up there and talking about hybrids. This
2985.12s: is an official CIA historian with
2988.72s: background, with checked credentials,
2990.72s: with clearances,
2992.80s: telling a group of other individuals
2995.04s: from universities, from different
2996.64s: departments in the in the defense uh
2999.20s: intelligence agencies about
3002.16s: hybridization programs,
 right? And I I
3004.96s: would say this uh I would preface that
3006.64s: with like I don't think there were other
3009.76s: members of the intelligence community
3011.28s: there. I think there were only CIA
3012.96s: officers
 and these postoc
 gotcha folks
3017.92s: uh that we sponsored.
 Do you do you
3020.16s: think now we're going to go more into
3022.08s: this uh hybrid thing because I want to
3024.16s: hear what they had to say about that? I
3026.16s: think it's very fascinating,
 but do you
3028.32s: think at any point before we get into
3030.08s: this that you might have been led into
3033.60s: some weird honey trap situation where
3036.32s: they give you passage material? Do you
3038.40s: think that that because I know a lot of
3039.92s: the audience is going to be like, "Oh,
3041.20s: maybe this is a whole setup or
3042.56s: something." Did that ever cross your
3043.92s: mind. Did that ever feel
 never crossed
3045.20s: my mind? Never crossed my mind. No.
3047.28s: Yeah. It didn't feel like that at all.
3049.12s: Mm-
 Okay.
 Not at all. Um because when
3053.52s: there's passage material, we actually
3055.12s: read into the passage material. And my
3058.00s: explanation for that is this that I was
3059.76s: involved in uh some covert programs
3063.84s: and it required me to be overseas uh
3066.32s: undercover with a different name,
3068.80s: different complete different biography,
3071.44s: complete different history. I was sent
3073.44s: overseas with actual documents
3076.24s: and I was told that if you're stopped
3078.48s: even by um you know customs when you're
3081.20s: coming back to the United States or the
3083.44s: other customs of the foreign country
3084.80s: you're going to that we want you to have
3087.68s: a cover story. You have to have a cover
3089.52s: legend and you can use these cover
3091.92s: legends depending on the circumstance.
3094.32s: So I was given the passage material to
3096.32s: pass on
 and also um
3100.32s: I would say that because of the nature
3102.40s: of that symposium uh I discounted that
3106.00s: completely because of who was there.
3108.32s: Understood.
 And and and what was
3110.96s: everyone else's reaction to this news?
3114.96s: I was surprised that there was no
3116.64s: reaction.
 Huh.
 And I didn't even have a
3118.88s: reaction. I just took it all in. I
3121.20s: thought to myself, hm, sounds a little
3122.80s: classified to me, but I was interested
3125.36s: in what General Haynes has to say about
3128.08s: the hybridization, alien DNA, CIA's
3131.44s: interest in aliens.
 Okay, let's get into
3134.96s: this a little bit more because now
 now
3137.68s: this is becoming very very um very
3141.52s: interesting because this this connects
3143.28s: with so many other stories of you know,
3145.68s: experiencers and everything else. So the
3148.80s: CIA is basically
3151.12s: giving this presentation in an
3152.72s: unofficial UNC sorry in in an
3154.80s: unclassified capacity about
3159.52s: sequences in the DNA of the Roswell
3162.24s: aliens that are connecting human DNA.
 I
3167.28s: assume they were Roswell aliens. I would
3169.36s: say they were they were nonhumans.
 They
3171.52s: were nonhumans.
 Non-humans. Whether they
3173.36s: were collected from um the Roswell crash
3176.72s: or other retrievals,
3179.04s: I don't know.
 Okay.
 But the interest,
3182.40s: the key phrase that Gerald Haynes used
3184.72s: was
3187.20s: since World War II, after World War II,
3191.52s: we were interested
3193.60s: in alien DNA, particularly found in
3197.52s: humans.
3199.12s: At that time, I didn't know anything
3200.80s: about magenta. had no knowledge of
3203.12s: magenta of that craft and that retrieval
3206.80s: had no knowledge that we may have had
3208.64s: the
3210.40s: craft itself with as David Gush would
3213.04s: call biologics on board.
 But he said
3215.68s: after World War II so that in hindsight
3219.12s: makes sense that okay maybe
 you know
3221.68s: that's where it came from or other
3223.36s: retrievalss where there were um beings
3226.16s: on board. Yeah, because allegedly the
3228.40s: crash in Italy in Magento, which
3231.04s: happened in 33, wasn't sent to the
3233.68s: United States until Pope Pas agreed to
3236.16s: send it in 45.
 Yeah. 44 4545.
 44 45. So
3240.08s: that would have been what he was talking
3242.16s: about. But didn't and and maybe I'm
3244.80s: mistaken here, but I heard and this is
3246.80s: uncorroborated evidence or speculative
3249.92s: at best, but that the beings on board of
3252.00s: the Magenta craft were humanoid looking.
3256.24s: They were like tall blondes.
 Mhm.
 Uh so
3259.20s: I hear was that at all mentioned during
3261.52s: the symposium?
 No. No.
 Was was the type
3264.72s: of alien mentioned?
 No.
 Okay.
 And in my
3267.60s: mind I was thinking of the traditional
3269.36s: what I'll call traditional gray being.
3272.32s: That's what I had in my mind.
3275.04s: But um no, he didn't mention exactly
3277.12s: what kind of being. But what he said
3279.52s: about their interest, CIA's interest in
3282.72s: these
3284.24s: uh in these beings and uh human DNA,
3288.32s: yeah,
 in their genome was what I caught
3291.52s: because what he said afterwards rang all
3294.00s: kinds of like, oh, this sounds really
3296.00s: classified.
3297.68s: And that was the CIA had a program
3302.32s: to trace this alien DNA in certain
3307.20s: families
3309.04s: in the United States. And he mentioned a
3312.80s: particular region that this research
3315.04s: occurred in the northeast
3317.92s: United States. He won't go any further
3320.00s: than that. that certain families and
3324.32s: particularly their children were of
3327.20s: interest to CIA.
3330.80s: I don't know, I didn't know what to make
3332.64s: of it back then, but you start talk
3336.56s: talking about the gate program and um
3339.60s: subsequent uh studies of children and
3343.04s: their capabilities and their abilities
3345.28s: to do certain psionic things
 um that now
3350.24s: comes to my mind. since um since that
3352.56s: was brought out more recently.
3355.28s: So the CIA was interested in potentially
3360.48s: tracking the activity of hybrids, human
3365.28s: alien hybrids in the United States
 that
3367.52s: and going back in in their lineage as
3370.08s: well.
 In their lineage,
 right? And going
3371.84s: back in their ancestry as well. I don't
3374.96s: know how they collected this DNA. Um,
3378.72s: you know, we have oversight now, and
3380.48s: that oversight started in the mid70s.
3382.64s: Congressional oversight.
3384.88s: This sounded like it occurred before
3386.40s: there was congressional oversight
3387.68s: because you couldn't do that today.
3389.12s: Yeah. No, it would be illegal.
 Yes.
3391.44s: Completely. Um, so this may have
3394.72s: occurred earlier,
 right?
 That they were
3397.68s: interested and then um when we developed
3400.16s: in the '9s, we developed uh the ability
3402.48s: to sequence the human genome completely.
3405.36s: uh that may have furthered uh the uh
3408.48s: investigation into the alien DNA.
 Um
3414.96s: is has there ever been and feel free to
3418.56s: answer this with a one-word answer. Has
3421.28s: there ever been a situation that you
3422.72s: were in where you've gotten confirmation
3426.72s: of
3429.04s: the
3431.04s: government's involvement with human
3433.04s: alien hybrids?
3435.68s: Yes.
 Okay.
3438.16s: In an in and from a credible source, you
3440.88s: can say
 yes.
 Okay.
3443.84s: So, they know about the hybrids.
 Yes.
3447.04s: Okay. And you and you would I mean gun
3449.52s: to your head right now, you would you
3450.72s: would say absolutely.
 Absolutely. Yes.
3453.36s: Wow.
3456.48s: That's I mean that's something that's uh
3461.60s: you know my my mind races to all the
3464.40s: different cases that I hear right we
3466.56s: hear about so many so many so many
3469.68s: people talk about this and so many
3471.12s: researchers look into this from Bud
3472.88s: Hopkins to David Jacobs to you know John
3475.36s: Mack and John Carpenter all these
3477.76s: researchers who've looked into
3480.80s: um abduction phenomena experiencers and
3484.16s: the one thing that a lot of people I
3485.84s: think find interesting is the
3487.04s: interaction with these humanlike
 Mhm.
3490.96s: aliens.
 Yes.
 For lack of a better term.
3495.20s: Um,
3496.72s: now
3498.40s: is there anything else during that
3499.76s: symposium that might have, you know,
3502.88s: caught your attention about the human
3505.04s: hybrid program?
3507.44s: None about that program itself. uh other
3509.52s: than the fact of the interest and the
3511.84s: further investigation into family
3514.40s: lineages that certain families tend to
3516.80s: have a propensity for um this
3520.40s: hybridization to have occurred
3523.04s: um
 on behalf of the NHI. Let's let's be
3526.56s: clear here like this hybridization that
3528.80s: we're talking about isn't humans taking
3531.12s: No. No. It's it's like
3534.16s: maybe in their family's history they
3537.04s: were taken,
 right? And then
 their DNA
3540.56s: DNA may have been somehow enhanced.
 I
3545.60s: don't know what word to use.
 Altered.
3547.84s: Altered. Um I'm speculating here. I I
3550.64s: admit this is speculation. I don't know
3552.40s: how they do it. I'm not um versed in
3556.64s: anything to do with genetics. I'm not a
3559.04s: scientist about genetics. I don't know.
3560.96s: Um, but it seems to have been um a
3567.12s: a history of certain families having
3571.36s: certain DNA of interest now to CIA
3575.92s: because of the alien connection to that
3578.40s: DNA.
3582.40s: Do
3583.92s: are some of these families aware, do you
3585.68s: think?
 I don't know.
3589.76s: Okay.
3590.96s: Wow.
3593.12s: Now, on a perhaps related note, and
3597.44s: again, let me know how comfortable you
3599.52s: feel about talking about this, but
3601.28s: you've had experiences.
 Yes.
 Yeah. From
3603.52s: a young age.
 Yes.
 Um,
3607.92s: if you're willing, would you be willing
3609.44s: to open up a little bit about what those
3610.80s: experience were like and what the what
3613.44s: the interactions were like?
 Sure.
 Okay.
3616.72s: Um,
3618.40s: my first I won't say it's an experience
3620.96s: in a traditional sense of experiencers
3623.44s: with with non-humans, but my first
3627.20s: inclination occurred when I was four
3629.04s: years old. Um, I saw through a telescope
3631.92s: for the first time in my young life and
3634.08s: I was fascinated by what I saw, stars,
3637.20s: planets, um, the moon. Um, and I felt
3640.40s: like I belonged out there, not here. I
3643.68s: had this feeling of longing to go out
3645.68s: there because that's that's my home. I
3647.68s: don't know why I'm here at a young age.
3650.88s: And then um
3654.00s: I recalled being taken somewhere and it
3659.04s: seemed like I I don't know if it was a
3661.36s: dream or it actually occurred but I was
3664.56s: taken repeatedly at least three times
3667.44s: that I know of uh to a home
3671.92s: and this home was like set in a
3675.44s: Victorian kind of setting you know it's
3677.28s: not like a modern home in I would say
3679.36s: the late 50s early60s
3681.28s: It wasn't the late 50s, early 60s
3683.44s: rancher that everyone seemed to have
3685.92s: lived in back in that time, but this was
3688.40s: a Victorian home in the sense that, you
3690.32s: know, it had the turret on one side and
3693.04s: wraparound porch. It looked like
3694.80s: something from the 1890s, early 1900s,
3698.24s: and I was led by a woman, not my mother,
3701.44s: um going through the through the gate.
3706.00s: It was fenced through the gate to the
3708.32s: house uh on the porch and then she led
3711.68s: me to a room on the leftand side and
3714.88s: there was a doctor's office and so I
3717.28s: remember being examined undressed
3719.44s: examined by a doctor accompanied by a
3723.04s: nurse not the woman who took me but
3724.96s: another nurse and everything around
3727.36s: there looked very old like something
3730.88s: from vintage let's say like maybe from
3734.08s: the Victorian era.
3735.60s: Um, and I remember
3738.64s: vaguely of being injected by something
3741.76s: that there was a hypodermic needle
3744.96s: involved in a syringe
3747.28s: and then being dressed again and being
3749.52s: led out of the house again by the same
3751.52s: woman who took me and then that memory
3754.08s: would like fade. And this memory
3756.56s: happened twice
3758.48s: on the first floor and once on the
3760.24s: second floor. similar situation. I asked
3763.44s: my mother about, you know, did she take
3765.60s: me to the doctor and she said, "No, I
3767.20s: never took you to anything like that."
3770.08s: Um, that was my very first memory. And
3772.56s: then other memories I had was being in a
3776.00s: um early 1960s department store. They
3779.92s: were called Five and Dimes back then.
3782.80s: And it was a a bin of books. And I love
3785.92s: books. So my parents um they wouldn't
3788.72s: buy me toys but if I wanted a book I can
3790.96s: get a book anytime I want it. So I was
3793.76s: thumbming through these books and one
3795.76s: book I opened I recall vividly as I open
3799.84s: this book on this page on the lower left
3802.88s: hand side there was a drawing of
3808.00s: a caveman and a cave woman holding a
3811.52s: human baby up. The woman was holding a
3814.64s: human baby up and above that baby was a
3818.16s: flying what we would call a flying
3819.60s: saucer beaming a light on it. And I
3822.96s: received a message saying this is who
3826.24s: you are. This is where you came from.
3830.08s: And I said, I want this book. So closed
3834.16s: the book, put it in a place that I could
3836.24s: get it. There's very few people around.
3839.28s: And this is just random book there. And
3841.44s: I went to get my mother. I want this
3843.12s: book. And went to the same book bin.
3847.44s: Couldn't find a book. Disappeared where
3849.68s: I laid it. There was no one around to
3852.40s: pick that book up and buy it for
3853.92s: themselves. That was another experience
3856.08s: I had of some kind of messaging
3857.92s: occurring. And this wasn't a dream. This
3860.72s: was an actual I remember this happening.
3864.88s: Um, and then just feeling like I lived
3867.36s: before.
 Mhm.
 I had past lives before.
3872.64s: um
 at a young age
 at a young age and
3875.52s: then seeing my very first craft and was
3878.96s: uh with my cousins
3881.04s: uh my uncle uh was in the US Army. He's
3883.76s: a Japanese American and he fought in the
3886.80s: 442nd
3888.40s: combat regiment team. That was the
3889.84s: Japanese American unit that fought in
3891.76s: Italy.
3893.44s: um and he was in the army and we lived
3897.36s: uh my sister and I um lived with them as
3900.72s: we were waiting for our mother to come
3902.08s: from Japan.
3903.84s: And this was like 1958
3906.64s: 59 playing with uh my two cousins and
3910.32s: our neighbor children there. And I saw
3913.68s: off to the right Woods at this Army
3917.12s: base. It's was called Fort Lee at the
3919.76s: time in Petersburg, Virginia. and saw
3922.56s: this silvery craft rise up out of the
3925.76s: out of the trees. Very quiet. I pointed
3930.16s: to it, showed my my cousins and pointed
3934.96s: to the neighbor children, "Look at
3936.16s: there. Look at there." You know, I saw
3938.64s: it playing and they couldn't see a
3940.56s: thing. They couldn't see it.
 They
3942.16s: couldn't see it. It wasn't a derigible
3943.92s: or anything like that because no
3945.92s: propulsion. There was no gondola
3947.44s: underneath.
 What was the shape?
3950.48s: Like an oval. Yeah. Like an oval.
 Yeah.
3952.88s: Huh.
 Yeah. And it was just rising slowly
3956.00s: and just drift off, but they couldn't
3958.72s: see it. And I saw as plain as can be
3961.92s: that it's an actual object. They
3964.56s: couldn't see it. That was my first craft
3966.88s: sighting. The structured craft.
 How old
3968.88s: were you then?
 I was five. Five years
3972.16s: old.
3974.56s: Wow. And you remember that? Vividly.
3977.68s: Vividly. Vividly remember that. Now the
3980.08s: uh
3982.48s: the examination that they described the
3985.44s: medical examination that occurred when I
3987.12s: was around six.
 Mhm.
 And the past life
3990.08s: experiences were around seven.
 Okay.
3993.52s: And uh after that past life experience
3996.56s: at 7, I started getting feelings of like
4000.64s: I kind of knew where my my future life
4004.00s: would be like.
4005.84s: Hm.
 You know, I I had an interest in in
4008.88s: being in the Navy.
4011.60s: I'm going to join the Navy, see the
4013.36s: world. I want to go join the Navy. And
4015.20s: then in junior high school, we had to
4017.44s: write an essay on what will you want to
4019.20s: be when you grow up kind of thing. And I
4021.36s: said, I want to be a spy.
 And I thought
4023.92s: that I was going to be a spy even at
4026.32s: that age. And things fell into place in
4028.88s: my life where one after the other things
4032.08s: started occurring. Not because I planned
4033.92s: them, but it was the free will path I
4036.80s: took happened to coincide with what I
4040.00s: felt.
 Yeah.
 I didn't realize it would
4042.16s: lead me there, but everything I did led
4045.44s: up to my career at CIA
 and all the
4049.60s: things I experienced professionally and
4051.68s: personally while I was at CIA.
 Do you
4053.36s: think that was a path that was laid out
4054.80s: for you or is that a path that you laid
4056.80s: out for yourself at on some subconscious
4059.44s: level? I would say that I laid it out
4062.48s: for myself. I feel like I practiced free
4065.76s: will. The opportunities were presented
4068.16s: to me. I took those opportunities,
4070.88s: but and so taking those opportunities,
4073.52s: it led me to where I needed to be.
 Mhm.
4076.00s: So, you manifested it,
 I would say.
4078.16s: Yeah. I manifested it, but not
4079.84s: consciously. Not
 to the point that, oh,
4082.08s: yeah, I'm going to study these subjects
4084.08s: in school and I'm going to do this and
4085.84s: I'm going to do that because I want that
4087.52s: job.
 That didn't happen. just things
4090.08s: fell into place
4092.80s: where it that occurred. Okay.
4096.56s: Yeah. I mean that makes a lot of sense
4098.16s: to me. We you know we talked a little
4099.84s: bit about this at lunch too where I also
4102.64s: I also feel that that there's like
4104.40s: almost like a future memory like it's so
4107.84s: clear it almost seems like a memory but
4110.48s: it's like this vision and it just seems
4112.72s: u sort of like frictionf free
 in in your
4116.64s: in your uh way to get there. So yeah,
4118.56s: that makes a lot of sense to me. So
4121.36s: okay, in junior high and then um any
4125.20s: other run-ins
4127.36s: subsequent to this?
4130.00s: Well,
4133.04s: when um
4135.28s: I was in the Navy
 Mhm. Um, I happened to
4140.88s: sign up for a particular rate as we call
4144.08s: them in the Navy, the particular job and
4146.88s: trade for it dealing with electronics,
4148.96s: electronic warfare,
4151.20s: um, signals analysis basically, but
4154.08s: electronic warfare on ships. And that
4157.12s: led me to my very first, you know,
4159.12s: clearance. had a secret level clearance
4162.96s: and I also uh was put on the personal
4166.48s: reliability program PRP because uh the
4169.60s: ships back then destroyers and frigots
4171.68s: carried nuclear weapons on board.
 I see.
4174.24s: And so I was a guard for nuclear
4176.24s: weapons. That was one of my collateral
4177.76s: duties was to guard nuclear weapons. Um
4181.60s: and it was there that you know on my
4184.80s: first ship uh a movie came out. It was
4187.28s: called Three Days at a Condor,
4189.68s: starring Robert Reford and I forget the
4192.08s: actress's name. I know people out there
4194.88s: are screaming the name, but I Oh, Fay
4196.64s: Dunaway.
 Oh, okay.
 Yeah, Robert
4198.96s: reference Fay Dunaway. And of course the
4202.48s: story was that Robert Reford was a CIA
4204.64s: officer working um to uh as a researcher
4208.64s: of open source materials trying to
4211.20s: discern whether the open source
4212.72s: materials may have contained classified
4214.80s: information and that little station got
4218.00s: wiped out as the story goes and so forth
4220.08s: and so on.
 But um it was during the
4224.32s: course of that movie I was with my other
4226.48s: uh shipmates watching the movie. There
4228.64s: was some very attractive women behind
4230.80s: us, maybe a row or two behind,
4233.52s: and there was a scene where Robert
4235.68s: Riffford picked up the phone
4238.16s: and called the operator at Langley and
4242.16s: and played back some tones and the
4245.52s: Langley operator said, "Okay, that
4247.60s: number is da da." And I thought that was
4249.92s: so cool and the women behind us very
4252.40s: attractive saying, "That is so cool.
4255.20s: That is so awesome." And I go, "That's
4256.96s: my job. I need a job that women find
4259.84s: cool. And so, you know, at that time I
4262.80s: wasn't thinking um, you know, in terms
4264.88s: of, you know, joining CIA because that's
4267.36s: what I wanted to do.
 Sure.
 But it was
4269.76s: just coincided with that.
 Yeah.
 That
4272.40s: Yeah, that's what I wanted to do. And I
4273.84s: told um my shipmates, you know,
 I'm
4276.56s: going to be in CIA someday. And they
4278.32s: laughed at me.
 Oh, sure you are.
 No, no,
4281.20s: you know, I I see myself walking down
4283.76s: the hallways of CIA.
 Wow.
 I see it. I
4287.04s: visualize it. I can see that happening.
4290.16s: And eventually it turned out that way.
4292.08s: You know that what I did in the Navy was
4294.16s: of interest to CIA to the point that
4297.84s: um my senior year in college at George
4300.32s: Washington University. I major in
4302.00s: political science. Um there was an ad in
4305.12s: the Washington Post uh recruiting
4308.16s: military sigant personnel. If you did
4311.60s: signals intelligence in the military,
4314.24s: call us. Write to us. we're interested
4316.80s: in hiring you. And I responded to that
4319.28s: ad and that set in motion the process of
4322.96s: applying for that particular job in CIA.
4325.84s: Wow.
4328.48s: Um, so during your time at the CIA, I
4331.60s: mean 25 years is a long time, John.
4333.36s: That's a long time.
 Not really. No,
4336.16s: there been other officers who served uh
4338.24s: 30 40 years.
 Okay.
 But 25 years seems to
4341.12s: be
 the average limit. Uh, if you ask
4343.28s: Louando, 25 years. Jim Smivan, 25 years.
4347.04s: Ask me, 25 years.
 That's about as much
4350.00s: as
 I would say you can stand.
4354.16s: Okay. Well put. But that does seem like
4355.92s: a long time to be at at at a particular
4359.28s: um office that deals with so much
4362.56s: sensitive information. You know, it's
4364.64s: like drinking out of a fire hose every
4366.64s: day. Like you got all this stuff that
4368.40s: you have to compartmentalize. you have
4370.64s: to judge whether or not you know there's
4372.80s: there's so many uh variables and so many
4374.88s: things on the line including people's
4376.96s: lives and everything else. So it's a big
4378.48s: responsibility but out of those in that
4381.92s: 25 years
4384.32s: did you encounter anyone
4387.04s: uh within the agency that you knew for
4391.04s: sure
4394.08s: was read into one of the deeper
4396.40s: programs?
4400.32s: Yes.
 Okay.
4402.56s: Um did you have a lot of interactions
4405.12s: with this person?
 Yes I did. You did.
4407.60s: And
4409.92s: was there any was there any point were
4414.16s: there groundbreaking
4416.16s: was there groundbreaking information
4417.52s: given to you by these?
 No, because I
4419.92s: refuse to get that groundbreaking
4421.52s: information other than
 um the
4424.16s: gentleman's name is Pete. His first
4426.16s: names is Pete. He was in my parent
4427.92s: office. uh he was the subject matter
4430.32s: expert uh responsible for gathering
4432.32s: other subject management experts within
4434.08s: CIA to go to the orb working group.
 Mhm.
4437.76s: And um he wanted to read me in and I
4441.28s: said I'm not that interested. Um the
4445.20s: other person um well his name is Perry.
4451.20s: Hi there Perry. Uh he I can say that he
4454.40s: was CIA's UAP task force liaison
4456.88s: officer. I see.
 He is the David Gres
4459.20s: equivalent for CIA.
 Wow.
 And I know that
4462.72s: uh he's led uh TVY or temporary duty uh
4466.88s: trips to uh to Area 51 from this one
4470.40s: particular branch that seems to deal
4472.24s: with this um subject matter. Um and I
4477.84s: don't want to call out the branch name
4479.20s: because I think it's still active. Um
4480.80s: but it's in my parent office. It was in
4482.88s: my parent office. Um, and so it was him
4486.48s: and uh he was heir
4490.08s: and then there was under sea. There's
4491.92s: another gentleman, his first name is
4493.84s: Ken, that's initial M. So Perry O and
4498.32s: Ken M. Um, he was under sea. And the
4502.40s: undersea guy, uh, I was supposed to be
4504.24s: read into what I now know as NURO, Nuro,
4508.32s: the National Under Sea or Underwater
4511.04s: Reconnaissance Office. It's the undersea
4513.92s: equivalent of NRO.
 And there's a program
4518.00s: I can say out loud because it's already
4520.24s: been revealed and naval special programs
4522.64s: NSP.
4524.16s: Um, and that originally started uh way
4527.76s: back. One of my el chief uh chiefs uh
4531.76s: preceding me, his name was Jean Potit,
4534.80s: Eugene Potit, a legend at CIA and in the
4538.32s: intelligence community. and he started
4541.04s: something called palladium, the
4542.80s: palladium program as part of that
4544.88s: undersea thing. They were they were
4546.24s: releasing um objects uh from submarines
4552.40s: that would look like craft
4554.96s: from the submarine.
 Whoa.
 That was the
4556.96s: Platium program. It was designed to be a
4558.96s: countermeasure against uh radars.
 I see.
4562.72s: To throw them off the scent type deal.
4564.48s: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And I
4566.16s: think the Platium program is is pretty
4568.00s: well documented now. It's It's no longer
4570.16s: classified, I don't think. Um I think
4571.76s: you can search it and find out more
4574.32s: information about it, but um yeah, but
4577.20s: he was the uh control officer for that
4581.44s: particular Pentagon SAP
 Mhm.
 special
4584.00s: access program. Now, special access
4586.00s: programs, that's the Department of
4588.08s: Defense. If someone tells me I was a CIA
4591.12s: officer and I was in charge of a SAP, I
4593.28s: know that person is lying because there
4595.44s: are no SAPs at CIA. They're CAPS. the
4598.64s: controlled access program. So the ODNI
4600.96s: and CIA have CAPS, the Department of
4603.92s: Defense have SAPs. And he was the SAP
4607.60s: representative for that Pentagon program
4610.24s: doing with undersea things.
 Wow. That
4612.56s: guy knows stuff.
 That guy knows stuff.
4614.56s: And um he said the Pentagon he he my
4618.72s: name was submitted for that particular
4620.88s: compartment.
 Mhm.
 And the Pentagon came
4623.44s: back and said, "No, we're not going to
4624.24s: read John Ramirez into that. No way."
4627.12s: and he called me up and he said, "I
4629.92s: can't read you in." The Pentagon said
4631.76s: you cannot be read in.
 You specifically
4634.72s: You specifically cannot be read in.
 Was
4636.72s: it because of your previous interest in
4638.80s: That's what I think.
 Yeah. It seems like
4640.56s: that's
 I definitely think they looked at
4642.56s: my security file. In my security file,
4645.36s: uh, every 5 years we get reinvestigated.
4647.52s: Uhhuh.
 And every 5 years we go through
4650.00s: the same line of questioning.
 You got a
4651.52s: little notch on it.
 And Yep. There's a
4653.76s: check mark. um
 alien drawing beside you.
4656.80s: What are your hobbies? You know, what do
4658.40s: you like to do? What what what interests
4660.08s: you? And I said, I'm interested in UFOs.
4662.64s: And
 one of my things I like to do is is
4665.12s: listen to Art Bell and Coast to Coast
4667.28s: AM. I love that stuff. You know, that's
4669.36s: what I'm interested in.
 And um
 giant red
4672.48s: flag.
 That was in my security profile.
4674.32s: That that was my interest. And I
4675.60s: reported that several times. Also in my
4677.92s: security profile was the fact that I
4679.92s: attended UFO conferences. Yes.
 On my
4682.00s: own.
 Yes. This is because I had a
4684.16s: personal interest and I paid my own way.
4686.88s: Yes.
 For flights, hotels,
4688.72s: accommodations. The only thing I needed
4690.96s: was CIA's permission.
 And so, um, in the
4694.16s: office of security at CIA, there was
4696.00s: something called the external activities
4698.48s: branch.
 External activities branch,
4701.04s: anytime you go overseas or take a trip
4703.44s: or out of the Washington DC area, you
4706.88s: have to report yourself.
 No matter what.
4709.04s: No matter what. You can go on a vacation
4710.88s: Hawaii.
 Yeah. and you're out of the um
4714.40s: Washington DC area, you have to report
4716.64s: the fact that you're going on this
4717.84s: vacation.
 It's like the CIA's version of
4720.16s: TSA.
 Yeah, I that's a good way to put
4723.68s: it.
 Okay.
 Before there was a TSA, there
4726.08s: was CIA external activities. You had to
4728.56s: report.
 And if you don't report and
4730.80s: later it comes up in a reinvestigation
4732.40s: that you went on this trip and you
4733.76s: didn't report, you get in a lot of
4734.96s: trouble.
 Okay.
 What else did you not
4737.84s: report? See, that's the line of
4739.12s: questioning. They go when you withhold
4740.88s: information Yeah. from CIA during a
4743.04s: reinvestigation.
 Uh they want to know
4745.76s: why did you do that? Interesting.
 What
4747.28s: else did you not report? What else are
4748.96s: you hiding?
 Yeah.
 So, it behooves you to
4751.28s: think like uh like you're in a
4753.44s: confessional booth and confess all your
4754.88s: sins to mother security
 or father
4757.44s: security. Um you know, hey, forgive me
4760.08s: for my sins.
 Yeah. And they probably
4762.88s: have all that now with telephones
4764.80s: anyways. Like I mean it's
 Yeah. So
4767.04s: probably gotten way more sophisticated.
4768.80s: Right. Right. So, yeah. So, they knew
4771.12s: about that and uh so that I think that's
4773.04s: why I wasn't uh allowed to be read into
4776.08s: that particular compartment, but it has
4778.72s: to do with undersea stuff. And I know
4780.88s: that um that particular branch that Ken
4784.72s: was in uh did some interesting things
4788.16s: under the water.
 You know, underwater
4790.56s: comes up more and more. I mean,
4792.16s: obviously, there's a book that I'm just
4794.48s: starting to read now by Richard Dolan.
4796.48s: uh he put out on the history of USOS and
4799.76s: you know formerly I was also looking
4802.64s: into this alleged whistleblower that
4805.36s: came forward on one of these forums
4807.44s: talking about mobile construction units
4809.20s: underwater fastm moving large objects
4812.32s: and then we hear things you know from
4814.40s: Lou like him or not you know he he said
4816.88s: this multiple times and that's been
4818.16s: corroborated by other people including a
4820.24s: rear admiral Tim Galedet
 you know who
4822.56s: said yeah there are these massive
4824.08s: objects down there moving at 4 500
4826.88s: knots,
 right?
 Which which is very fast.
4829.52s: Yes. And so, uh, when Ken was explaining
4832.96s: why the Pentagon didn't want me to be
4834.80s: read, and I was arguing why I should be
4836.72s: read,
4838.40s: um, he said, "You don't understand,
4839.84s: John. This program is the highest
4844.80s: secret, top secret in the entire United
4848.00s: States government. This top secret
4850.80s: information exceeds that of Manhattan
4853.76s: Project." And he mentioned Manhattan
4855.52s: Project by name exceeds the Manhattan
4858.00s: Project and the Pentagon doesn't want
4859.84s: you to be read.
 Whoa. So, okay,
 that's
4865.04s: and the specific underwater one.
 Mhm.
4868.80s: Okay, that makes a lot of sense.
 And I
4870.64s: knew about the uh we use fast attack
4872.96s: submarines for spying. Everyone knows
4875.04s: that that submarines are great
4876.48s: reconnaissance vehicles, but it has
4878.96s: nothing to do with reconnaissance,
4881.12s: mundane prosaic reconnaissance of uh an
4884.00s: adversary submarine.
 No, not when you're
4885.68s: talking about something bigger than the
4886.72s: Manhattan project.
 Bigger than the
4887.76s: Manhattan project. And that's the key
4889.68s: phrase that I I it was his way of
4892.72s: telling me what this program was about
4894.80s: without saying what about UFOs.
 Yeah.
4897.92s: Well, it's something anomalous under the
4899.76s: sea. Let's put it that way.
 Well, it's
4900.96s: either that or a Kraken, you know. I
4902.96s: know that his his um branch uh did
4906.88s: operations under the sea, retrieving
4908.96s: things.
 Now, just to be fair, it could
4912.08s: be
 submarines, aircraft.
 Yeah. It could
4914.64s: be adversary undersea
 satellites,
 stuff.
4917.36s: Yeah.
 You know, but
 rockets.
 Yeah. But
4919.60s: there's something
4921.60s: I can't mention the name, but I know the
4923.76s: people who worked there
 um in that
4926.64s: particular program. And if I said the
4928.40s: names um you would say, "Huh,
 I see."
4931.36s: Yeah, I'm not going to say the names,
4932.48s: not not on this broadcast.
 And I I won't
4934.72s: pry it out of you, but one one thing
4936.48s: that is interesting that I, you know,
4938.72s: often come back to as well as Bob Lazar
4940.96s: was,
4942.88s: you know, sort of working for what
4945.36s: seemed like some type of naval
4947.60s: department.
 Yeah.
 Or at least
 the facade
4951.44s: was it was the naval, you know, office
4954.32s: of naval intelligence or department of
4956.48s: department of naval intelligence, which
4958.00s: there is an office of naval
4959.44s: intelligence. There isn't a department
4961.36s: of naval intelligence, but I will tell
4962.80s: you this that when I was at CIA, I had a
4965.60s: cover legend that I could use when I go
4968.08s: on TDY to conferences or whatever. And
4971.76s: uh I was assigned to a Pentagon office
4974.32s: that did not exist and I had an ID card
4977.12s: with my photo on it and everything looks
4979.60s: like a real legitimate Pentagon
4982.32s: identification.
4983.92s: Um, and there was on the flip side of
4986.96s: that, uh, there was a signature of my
4988.80s: supervisor, a phone number to call, all
4990.80s: this stuff. And if you call that phone
4992.64s: number and ask about me, because my true
4994.88s: name was on the front of that card with
4996.16s: my picture, uh, do you have John Ramirez
4998.88s: working for you? And person will verify
5001.52s: the fact that I worked for that Pentagon
5003.44s: office
 when you in fact did not.
 When in
5005.44s: fact, I did not. Yeah. So, uh, talking
5007.92s: about Bob Lazar, he could be in a
5009.44s: similar situation where he was assigned
5011.60s: to a non-existent cover office that look
5015.52s: legitimate.
 Sounds the same.
 Yeah. To to
5018.24s: a uh to the untrained eye, to someone
5021.52s: who's not wellversed in the uh
5023.76s: Department of Defense. Um, that looks
5026.08s: legit.
 Yeah.
 You know, and the reason
5027.92s: why I use that card is so I can get
5029.52s: government rates for hotels and flights.
5031.36s: Yeah.
 You know,
 that's how we used it.
5034.00s: And it was it was something to flash.
5035.68s: It's the Flash ID to make you look
5037.76s: legitimate,
 right? And in Bob's in Bob's
5040.72s: case, I mean, obviously, if you're
5042.00s: dealing with something as immense as
5044.00s: reverse engineering uh ET craft, no
5047.76s: surprise that you would have some type
5049.44s: of legend or or cover or or flash ID. I
5053.52s: mean, that's that feels like the minimum
5055.44s: amount of security that they would
5057.84s: require.
 Yeah, it's very light. I mean,
5060.08s: if you scratch beneath the surface,
5061.52s: it'll fall apart. But
 yeah,
 the the idea
5064.08s: was not to gain entry into another
5066.48s: government or Pentagon
 I see
 uh base cuz
5070.16s: I have something called a CAC card,
5072.16s: common access card
 that we were we were
5074.72s: given and so I could use that card to
5076.40s: get into a DoD facility.
 Um and people
5079.92s: in the DoD know what a CAC card is. I
5082.24s: don't know if they still use them, but I
5083.92s: was assigned one. Um
 and uh so it made
5087.20s: me look like a Pentagon employee even
5088.88s: though I wasn't.
 Yeah.
 But this was a
5090.72s: little bit in-depth. you know, this was
5092.40s: a real card that
 that uh could gain me
5095.44s: access into actual facilities,
 right? I
5097.76s: mean, on par for being a spy, I think,
5100.24s: you know,
 um which is I I would expect
5103.84s: something like that if I were a spy, be
5105.04s: like, where's my secret ID?
 Um let's
5108.80s: shift a little bit into into something
5112.00s: first. I want to ask just like off the
5113.68s: top of my head, just something I'm
5114.96s: really interested in. Um, has there ever
5116.96s: been any talk stories or anything that
5119.04s: you can share on Wright Patterson
5121.84s: airfield that that you heard uh in by
5125.60s: the water coolers?
 Not when I was at
5127.60s: CIA. I heard more about right pad after
5130.32s: left CIA and got involved in this topic
5132.56s: at all. Uh,
 back then right Pat, you
5135.52s: know, it was air force base and I dealt
5137.36s: with foreign technology division. Um,
5140.00s: and then it was called NASC.
 Mhm.
 It had
5142.24s: a few names in between. Uh, one was NAIK
5145.76s: NIC, but that only lasted for shortly.
5148.56s: And then they added space to air,
5150.40s: national air and space intelligence
5152.24s: center.
 And I dealt with counterparts
5154.32s: there.
 Okay. But never anything
 not to
5156.64s: do with UFOs. Um,
 no, I it was mostly my
5161.52s: day job of uh dealing with um Soviet and
5164.48s: Russian missile tests,
 right?
 Um, there
5168.40s: was a meeting that was had and we'
5169.92s: mentioned this earlier, Brad and
5171.44s: McDonald, BDM.
 Mhm.
5174.08s: Something interesting happened there as
5175.20s: well,
 right? That wasn't a meeting. That
5176.56s: was me being briefed into a two
5178.88s: compartments.
 Mhm.
 Um and so um I was
5182.96s: just there, this goes back to my radar,
5187.12s: my beloved radar. Now I use the Russian
5190.32s: name for it. It's Neman. Ne-p
5195.36s: stands for polygon.
 Okay.
 Neman polygon.
5198.40s: It's it's a very unique radar. It's very
5200.96s: sophisticated. Uh, it's probably still
5202.80s: the most sophisticated waveforms ever
5204.48s: seen coming out of a radar. And I've
5206.32s: seen a lot of different signals coming
5208.24s: out of radar.
 Um, highly capable,
5211.36s: extremely advanced radar. Um, and so we
5216.32s: were flying something that wasn't a
5219.52s: satellite or wasn't a conventional
5222.00s: satellite. It was a very unique
5225.12s: spacecraft.
5227.04s: And the spacecraft had uh a like a radar
5231.68s: warning receiver in a car that you know
5234.48s: if the police are as a police car
5236.80s: sitting by the road you know
 with a
5239.04s: radar gun want to see what your speed
5240.96s: limit is you can detect it. So this this
5244.72s: craft had a similar type of system that
5249.36s: if it was illuminated by a radar, it
5253.52s: would detect that illumination and
5255.84s: actually it would collect some of the
5257.92s: parameters of that radar.
 M
 so you can
5261.12s: further it's not just a blip, you know,
5263.36s: you can further identify it by looking
5265.04s: at the parameters and you can match it
5266.72s: to known signals. So I was read into
5270.24s: this spacecraft and that subsystem that
5273.12s: detected the signals as well as um the
5276.48s: intelligence collected by that
5277.92s: particular spacecraft. It's uh dealt
5280.56s: with intelligence surveillance and
5281.92s: reconnaissance
5283.44s: but it didn't look like a satellite. It
5286.32s: uh
 what did it look like?
 It looked like
5288.08s: an egg
5290.32s: tapered.
 Now that's interesting. Yeah,
5293.44s: it it was it was it wasn't uh a cylinder
5296.32s: like a tic tac, but it was
 teardrop
5300.08s: teardrop oval shape with tapered ends.
5304.88s: So obviously when we mention egg,
5307.28s: there's a lot of cases in the past and
5309.92s: I've looked at a lot even in Spain and
5312.08s: like all sorts of cases around the world
5313.52s: with like eggcraft even going back to
5315.28s: Lonnie Zamora um in his you know Sakura
5319.76s: New Mexico sighting. But one thing that
5322.00s: does come to mind is this Jake Barber
5324.32s: video of the alleged recovery.
5328.32s: Now what I find interesting here is that
5332.00s: BDM Bradock Dunn and McDonald went
5335.28s: through several acquisitions.
 Yeah.
 And
5337.60s: in 2002
 they were acquired by Northrup
5341.12s: Grummond.
5344.00s: Um, there's a lot of talk that the range
5346.96s: that this egg was collected from was on
5351.12s: Northrup's range.
 Mhm.
5357.76s: Do you think that Jake Barber is aware
5361.52s: that the craft that he collected was
5363.84s: ours?
5365.52s: I can't say it was ours or NHI, right? I
5368.80s: just know that the craft I was briefed
5371.68s: into could not have landed
5376.40s: cuz it was a spacecraft and it orbited.
5379.76s: It was an orbital craft that flew into
5382.80s: space collecting intelligence and I
5385.76s: don't think it could land.
 Didn't have
5387.68s: any landing gears or capabilities.
 I
5389.84s: don't think so. I think it it was if it
5391.92s: was de-orbited, it would burn up in the
5393.68s: atmosphere like anything else coming
5395.68s: back from orbit into the Earth's
5397.68s: atmosphere. It would just burn up.
 Mhm.
5399.92s: So, I don't think it it was retrieved in
5402.32s: that sense. It can't it could not have
5404.24s: been retrieved. Um, and I may be wrong.
5406.96s: Mhm. Well, I just find it really
5408.88s: interesting that there's this giant
5410.32s: coincidence.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Do you know
5411.92s: what I mean? That we're talking about
5412.88s: Eggcraft. We're also talking about the
5414.32s: same location, the same company that
5416.00s: deals with this. This all seems a little
5418.00s: bit too
 right,
 you know, closely.
 I
5420.32s: would say this that if you saw and I saw
5422.72s: the photographs of this particular
5424.64s: spacecraft in a hanger.
 Oh.
 Um that's I
5428.32s: didn't see the spacecraft itself. They
5430.00s: showed me this is what it looked like.
5431.84s: This is what it looks like. This is what
5433.20s: it can do. This is why we built it and
5436.64s: this is why um we're interested in
5439.36s: finding out whether it can be detected
5441.84s: because it's supposed to be uh stealthy
5444.80s: in nature.
5446.40s: It shouldn't have been tracked by
5448.24s: anything. Yet, it was indicated, but
5450.88s: based on the data I saw that it was
5452.64s: being tracked by the Russians using this
5454.48s: fantastic radar
 I talked about, Nean P.
5458.32s: Um,
5459.84s: so I I don't think it was I don't think
5463.60s: Jake Barber's video I don't know what
5465.92s: the source of that was. I don't know if
5468.08s: that was the actual craft that he was
5470.64s: responsible for retrieving. Um, I don't
5472.96s: know. But I one thing what I was briefed
5475.84s: in could not have entered the earth's
5478.00s: atmosphere and land like that
 intact. It
5482.48s: would have it would have burned up.
5484.08s: Right.
5485.60s: And the craft that you saw that they
5488.00s: showed you that was man-made.
 Oh yeah.
5491.20s: Yeah.
 Oh yeah. It was definitely Well,
5494.00s: let's put it this way. It was built by
5496.16s: humans. I have no idea what technology
5499.20s: was inside the craft other than I know
5501.52s: that there was this radar warning
5503.20s: component in it and I know it took
5504.96s: pictures and I know that it wasn't
5507.60s: supposed to be detected. Okay. Well,
5510.24s: that's that's just interesting there.
5512.08s: Um, another question that I had I I'm
5514.40s: going to run through a few of these
5515.84s: questions that I've been holding off on
5517.68s: here while we've been chatting. Um,
5521.92s: have you heard of Tim Taylor?
 Yes, I
5524.16s: have.
 Yeah. Have you ever had a runin
5525.60s: with him? Have you ever talked to him?
5526.80s: No.
 Okay. No, I don't think I have. Um I
5531.20s: had a LinkedIn Pro account for a while.
5534.48s: Um Temp Taylor, I think he may have
5538.40s: reached out to me, but I didn't really
5540.88s: reciprocate.
5542.48s: I think he just sent a hello message.
5544.48s: Okay. Hi, how you doing kind of thing.
5546.96s: This was after I started doing my
5548.56s: earlier podcast interviews. Yes. And he
5550.56s: come back.
 So, he was interested in in
5552.48s: perhaps talking to you
 maybe. I don't
5554.08s: know. but we didn't follow through and
5555.84s: so I I can't say that I know him in any
5558.08s: way.
 Mhm. And where does remote viewing
5561.92s: and that stuff fall in? Which category?
5563.68s: Mazant. That's Mazant as well.
 I would
5565.68s: put it in a mazent because there's a
5567.76s: branch of Mazant. Um that is like
5570.40s: biological mazent or biometric mazent.
5572.88s: Biometric mazent. Okay.
 And a human
5574.72s: brain mazent is a real thing. It's
5577.28s: signatures coming from the human brain.
5580.00s: Whoa.
 And so that
 they can measure that.
5583.20s: Yeah, you can. I mean, Stanford
5585.44s: University has
 Yeah. But I mean,
 do do
5589.20s: you think they still do it?
 I would
5591.12s: think so. Yeah.
 So, I I think there it's
5594.08s: still a field of study.
 Um
5597.52s: because humans had uh magnetic sense at
5600.64s: one time just like whales and uh
5603.60s: cessations, you know, they they could
5605.12s: sense magnetic field changes in the
5607.84s: earth and they use the these creatures
5609.84s: use it to navigate.
 Mhm. And every time
5612.08s: there's some disruption, solar flares or
5614.16s: whatever that causes a disruption, they
5616.80s: get lost and they beach themselves,
5619.20s: right?
 Because they get lost. And the
5620.80s: humans, they detected that we have a a
5623.60s: dormant capability of doing that.
5625.84s: Whether it's dormant or it was made
5627.76s: dormant deliberately, I don't know.
5629.68s: That's a whole another area of
5631.20s: discussion. But humans had that
5635.12s: or still do a dormant sense of Earth's
5638.80s: magnetic field. Also your human skin is
5642.48s: a mazing collector in that the uh the
5645.68s: sweat glands are helical antennas. So
5649.76s: underneath your skin there are little
5651.92s: helical antennas
5654.24s: and they act like electromagnetic
5656.16s: antennas and they could measure the
5658.48s: wavelength that your skin is is um
5662.48s: is able to detect.
 It's it's up in the
5665.44s: like 400 500 gigahertz range up there.
5668.88s: millimeter wave they call it. But you
5671.60s: know, you think about how to affect a
5674.32s: human being, zap them with that range of
5677.52s: signals
 and they start sweating
 start
5679.84s: doing all kinds of things or you can use
5681.44s: acoustic
 right
 uh signatures you
5684.64s: acoustic signals and you can you can
5686.72s: make somebody sick.
 Mhm.
 Or um in a risk
5690.56s: extreme
5692.16s: you you can make them um you can make
5694.08s: them vomit.
 Oh my gosh. Because you know
5696.16s: your your abdominal cavity there's a
5699.28s: resonance there in the audio range
 and
5702.00s: if you hit it with that audio range you
5703.76s: know all of a sudden things in there
5705.04s: starts to quiver and you get physically
5707.28s: sick.
 Well if uh if the people watching
5709.92s: this video don't leave a like and a
5711.84s: comment I'm going to play one of those
5713.12s: sounds.
 So
 yeah and that goes back to
5716.24s: AHI the uh you know the anomalous health
5718.56s: incidents.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Uh with syndrome.
5721.68s: Yeah. They're probably utilizing that
5723.84s: type of human mazet.
 Yeah.
 As a a
5727.28s: weaponized version of it. The offensive
5729.60s: side of it. Not just collecting it,
5731.60s: which is more defensive and passive, but
5734.00s: using it to affect another human being.
5735.92s: Yeah. And it would be an incredible
5737.92s: shame to do all those studies, you know,
5741.84s: whether it's MK Ultra and Stargate and
5743.84s: all these things after decades and
5746.80s: decades and finding that, oh, there is
5748.72s: something here, there is something and
5750.88s: then just dropping it.
 Like it seems so
5754.48s: ridiculous. Like especially because all
5757.12s: of that stuff to me seems incredibly
5759.60s: cheap.
 It's not something that's very
5762.16s: expensive. You know, you give a guy a
5763.92s: piece of paper and a pencil or a woman
5765.84s: and sit him in a room with no windows. I
5768.00s: mean, that doesn't cost millions of
5769.76s: dollars.
5771.52s: What is one piece of information that
5772.96s: you think everyone should know? This is
5776.48s: where we're going to talk about
5777.52s: consciousness. Consciousness seems to be
5782.72s: the foundation for the phenomenon. That
5785.68s: is how humans perceive the phenomenon
5789.12s: and how the phenomenon perceives humans.
5791.20s: There seems to be a a consciousness
5793.60s: aspect to this aside from the nuts and
5797.60s: bolts. Even though JAPS may not have any
5801.12s: nuts or bolts on the craft, but we call
5803.44s: it that. But the structured craft, aside
5805.36s: from the structured craft, um that's
5807.76s: just physics. That's just mechanical
5809.68s: engineering. That's just material
5811.28s: science
5813.20s: that can be all figured out. But how it
5815.60s: works, there seems to be a consciousness
5818.00s: aspect to it that we don't quite
5819.92s: understand.
5822.24s: And I've been hearing that more and more
5824.16s: particularly the way the phenomenon
5826.88s: communicates with certain individuals
5829.36s: and the way individuals can communicate
5831.92s: with the phenomenon. So you have the
5834.56s: human initiated contact you know the
5836.80s: heist you can have that or um using
5840.64s: psionics as Jake Barber's team is doing
5843.92s: to lure the craft down. That's a real
5846.08s: thing because the Russians have already
5847.60s: done it.
5849.12s: Do you think that that's
5851.44s: because that to me sounds so insane?
5854.96s: Because I I I just struggle with that
5857.20s: concept
5858.96s: because if you were an intelligent
5861.52s: species,
 arguably
5864.56s: vastly more intelligent than the people
5866.72s: who are quote unquote summoning you or
5869.52s: inviting you. Um, fool me once,
 shame on
5874.32s: you. But fool me twice, shame on me.
5876.24s: Like I
5878.00s: these aren't fish. These are intelligent
5880.88s: things. Surely they know that if they
5883.92s: get in range, they're going to be taken
5885.12s: down by some microwave cannon. Like I
5887.04s: mean I' I' I'd be hardressed to think
5889.36s: that these intelligent beings would be
5891.04s: willing to put themselves in a situation
5893.28s: a second time to be drawn in. And to me
5897.68s: this, you know, only my opinion, but
5902.00s: seems like we might be interacting with
5904.08s: some type of system rather because if
5909.36s: you simulate war games and these things
5911.28s: start appearing, that doesn't seem like
5912.72s: an intelligently controlled thing that
5915.68s: we're It seems like a system. It seems
5917.92s: like some type of immune response to our
5922.40s: games that we're that we're putting out
5924.24s: there, you know. Um because again, I
5927.44s: don't think so that that that's where I
5929.36s: struggle with all of that. But you said
5931.28s: that the Russians are doing this.
 The
5932.96s: Russians have done it. Yeah. They
5934.32s: they've they've done what Jake Barber is
5936.72s: doing now.
 They've already done it. And
5939.44s: where where does that information come
5940.80s: from?
 Uh it comes from a major general
5943.20s: in the Russian Air Force, retired. He
5945.28s: said that uh they were able to lure UAP
5948.40s: down
 H
 and then when it came down they
5951.68s: were able to interact with the UAP just
5954.24s: by body movements and thought.
 Okay. And
5958.24s: lure them in how? Using psionics or
5961.04s: using nukes?
 No, not nukes. No, it was
5964.00s: it was like they were using uh
5966.16s: electromagnetic signals.
 Uhhuh.
 Um and
5969.52s: frequencies and
 Yeah, certain
5971.12s: frequencies. Um, I would say that 3
5973.60s: ghahertz is uh magic frequency for some
5978.32s: reason. Um, they respond to 3 GHz. The
5981.04s: radar I talked to you about before,
5982.88s: Neiman P, that is an S-band radar. Um,
5986.16s: it works just below 3 GHz. It's a very
5989.04s: wideband signal. Um, below three 3
5992.08s: gigahertz. Um, it seems to me that Oh,
5995.52s: and the
5997.44s: the craft followed by the RB47
6001.60s: that the late Dr. James McDonald wrote
6003.76s: about um the RB47 being a uh
6008.08s: reconnaissance aircraft. They detected
6010.56s: with their onboard signals collection
6013.44s: systems a 3 gigahertz signal coming from
6015.84s: that.
 Oh. that they followed. Um the
6020.48s: there were two radars at White Sands uh
6023.20s: testing the V2 and those radars, the STR
6027.36s: 587 they were called. It's a 3 GHz
6030.88s: signal.
 Hm. Interesting.
 Um so 3 GHz for
6035.04s: some reason seems to be um the magic
6037.92s: wavelength uh frequency rather.
 Yeah. Or
6040.16s: dog whistle.
 Yeah, maybe. I don't know.
6042.88s: Um but according to this major general
6046.32s: Alexev um they were able to lure down
6048.80s: that this these craft and interact with
6052.00s: them.
6053.60s: Interesting.
6056.96s: I mean I'd like to see it happen and and
6060.16s: I I wish them the best. I hope I hope
6061.76s: that this is uh you know something that
6063.76s: can be made public and and can be shared
6065.68s: with everybody.
 Yeah. And I have
6068.00s: classified sources um documenting
6072.24s: interactions,
 that type of interaction,
6074.16s: but I can't talk about it because
 it's
6076.80s: classified.
 Well, um it is classified.
6079.84s: Um and I kind of alluded to it in
6081.92s: previous interviews. I laid it all out
6083.92s: for the Age of Disclosure film
 that, um
6087.36s: I did not appear in,
 but I participated
6090.00s: in the making of that film. uh they they
6092.72s: ran up against a time constraint and so
6094.96s: they had to cut four hours down to
6097.36s: something that would fit Yeah. at the
6099.20s: Southwest
6100.88s: conference. Yeah. And so, uh, I was able
6103.60s: to collaborate
6106.16s: corroborate that
 what they did and
6108.64s: explained it a little further, but I'm
6110.24s: hesitant to do it now because that film
6112.64s: provided us with a cover, top cover that
6116.40s: if I say that when there's uh, the now
6120.24s: Secretary of State on there and and
6122.72s: senators and Congress people and these
6124.96s: other high level officials like Jim
6127.20s: Clapper all saying things like that.
6129.44s: Yeah. Um, I felt more comfortable saying
6131.44s: that.
 Are you referring to the incident
6133.68s: with the red cube?
 I don't know about
6136.24s: the red cube.
 No.
 No.
 The giant cube.
6140.00s: Okay.
 Don't know about that.
 I saw that
6141.68s: movie, the Age of Disclosure, and that
6145.04s: was mentioned in there.
 Yeah. I didn't
6146.56s: know anything about I hadn't seen the
6147.92s: film.
 Okay.
 I just know what I said.
6149.76s: Yeah. The two hours two plus hours that
6152.56s: I I talked about.
 My goodness.
6155.60s: Yeah. Those would be good podcasts to
6157.12s: release as well, I'm sure, in in their
6158.80s: entirety.
 Yeah.
6161.44s: All right. Uh John, we're gonna hop to
6163.20s: some audience questions. Thanks so much
6164.88s: for indulging all of my questions, but
6166.48s: we're going to get to uh some
6167.76s: interesting audience questions. Do you
6169.20s: want to give me a second? I'm going to
6170.16s: turn on that camera back here.
6173.92s: So, for the people that don't know, uh
6175.76s: if you become a member here on this
6177.36s: channel, we refer to you as interns or
6180.40s: operatives depending on um you know,
6182.80s: what level you opt in on. But you do as
6186.24s: an operative have the opportunity to ask
6188.24s: the guest a question. These are
6189.60s: prevetted and I've selected them. Uh
6192.08s: give I give everyone 24 hours heads up
6196.16s: and uh right behind me these will be the
6198.96s: questions. So
6202.80s: oh this is good. Actually we were going
6204.08s: to touch on this and we we forgot to. So
6206.32s: perfect.
6214.80s: question is, what convinced you the 2027
6217.92s: revelation had to be made public despite
6221.28s: your background in secrecy from Hubby?
6224.32s: Well, first of all, um, I didn't bring
6227.28s: that up in the environment I talked
6229.60s: about. It was a skiff. Mhm.
 There were
6231.60s: government officials there that brought
6232.96s: it up and I didn't give it much thought
6236.40s: because 2027 was mostly talked about in
6239.12s: the uh channeling community and I don't
6242.72s: really follow the channel community in
6245.04s: any kind of depth.
 Yeah. Like Bashar
6247.12s: recently talks about it a lot
 right and
6249.12s: I'm surprised that they are talking
6250.64s: about it but um that question did come
6253.76s: up that discussion came up and I telling
6256.56s: you what I told them is I have no idea.
6259.44s: Mhm. I don't know. Um, you should ask
6262.56s: the channelers about it. Ask Chris Bleo,
6265.84s: ask Anelie Schultz. Um, any channeler,
6269.12s: you know, just talk to them. They seem
6271.36s: to know something. I don't, but they
6273.68s: press me for my opinion.
 Mhm.
 And it's
6277.20s: just an opinion, right, of something
6278.88s: that is out in social media.
 Sure.
 All
6281.76s: right. So, it's not secret
 in any sense.
6285.60s: Yeah. it's just a topic that's coming up
6288.08s: in the public domain. So, I gave them my
6290.88s: opinion and I said, "Well, I don't know,
6293.68s: but
6295.20s: what is your hope? What What do you hope
6297.36s: for in 27?" You know, that kind of
6299.76s: phrasing.
 So, well, my personal hope is
6303.28s: that
6304.96s: maybe they'll show up. I don't know.
6306.64s: Maybe maybe the NHI will show up in
6308.48s: 2027.
6310.40s: That's my hope. Let's just call it a
6313.28s: year they show up. the arrival year,
6316.64s: let's say, and let's say they do arrive.
6319.76s: Well, wouldn't it behoove you guys in
6322.00s: government to start disclosing what you
6324.08s: guys know about the phenomenon now? And
6328.00s: this is in 2022,
6330.00s: five years from now, if they do show up,
6332.88s: then people won't won't be like
6336.88s: fearful or surprised or you know,
 yeah,
6340.24s: you won't have this catastrophic
6343.36s: revelation coming forward. Prepare now
6346.32s: the people share all the information you
6348.64s: can so that if they the NHI show up
 Mhm.
6353.76s: then we are prepared for it because I
6356.16s: told them you guys don't control
6358.48s: disclosure. They do. They can show up
6361.76s: tomorrow.
6364.72s: Very true. That's a very good point.
6367.92s: What are you going to say then?
 Oh,
6370.32s: shoot. Yeah, we knew about this for like
6372.24s: since, you know, after World War II.
6374.56s: We're sorry we didn't tell you about it.
6376.32s: We lied to you about it. That's not a
6378.32s: good optic there. Reveal what you know
6381.12s: now.
 Yeah. So, it's not a secret.
6385.44s: There's no secret about 2027. So, the
6388.32s: environment was actually a skiff, but a
6391.44s: skiff is you don't have to have a top
6393.28s: secret clearance to walk into a skiff.
6395.20s: You can walk into a skiff, but you can
6397.52s: only talk about unclassified things in a
6399.60s: skiff, right? It's up to top secret. And
6403.68s: anything below that and below that is
6405.60s: unclassified. And this is nothing of of
6408.00s: any kind of classification,
 hearsay. At
6410.64s: this point,
 I I would say hearsay is a a
6413.76s: good way to phrase it.
 Yeah.
 But I don't
6415.60s: I don't know what's going to happen in
6416.72s: 2027. The only thing I'm concerned about
6418.72s: in 2027 is I'm a big NFL fan. I love
6423.20s: American football, right? And I know in
6425.44s: 2027 that my favorite team, the
6427.44s: Washington Commanders, will be the host
6429.36s: team for the NHL uh NFL draft in
6433.52s: Washington DC in 2027. I plan to be
6435.68s: there.
 So that's a big deal.
 That's a
6437.28s: big deal to So, so that's what's
6438.72s: happening in 2027. You heard it here
6440.72s: first.
 Washington Commanders is the host
6442.88s: team for the NFL draft in Washington DC
6445.12s: in 2027.
 Yeah.
 And I hope to be there.
 I
6447.92s: can tell you for sure we will not be
6449.60s: asking you about 2027 in 2028.
6454.24s: So that that that you can you can take
6456.96s: to the bank. Um here's another one here.
6470.80s: Don't see who this is from here, but
6473.52s: this is
 uh many experiences believe
6475.36s: entities are angelic or demonic. Are
6477.52s: both true or is one group being lied to
6479.60s: in your opinion?
 I don't label them as
6481.52s: angelic or demonic, so I don't know how
6483.44s: to answer this. Um, yeah,
 for me,
6485.84s: they're just entities that showed up and
6489.60s: interacted with me. I personally had
6492.24s: only one I would call bad but not
6495.04s: demonic experience and that experience
6497.92s: was with a reptilian like being that
6501.12s: showed up in in my condo when I lived in
6504.64s: Washington DC.
 Can you talk us through
6506.88s: that?
 Sure. I was really pissed off um
6509.44s: because it woke me up and it came toward
6512.56s: me and I got up out of bed and started
6515.44s: punching it with this right fist as hard
6519.12s: as I can.
6520.96s: uh cursing at it or whatever just
6522.80s: because it was bothering me. I wanted to
6524.40s: go to sleep and it grabbed my arm and
6527.36s: then I have no memory after that. But I
6529.60s: woke up in the morning with claw marks
6532.96s: on my right forearm. Now a
6537.04s: debunker would say, "Oh, you just had a
6539.36s: nightmare and you scratched yourself."
6541.92s: I don't think so because after that uh
6545.04s: incident happened uh on further nights
6548.40s: and this happens like I would be woken
6550.32s: up around between 3 and 4 let's say 3:30
6554.16s: and I would look over on one side of the
6556.40s: bedroom there and there would be a cloud
6558.96s: a green cloud with little white sparkles
6562.96s: in that cloud and I got a sense of
6566.24s: protection from it you know that oh you
6569.20s: know we're here to protect you go back
6572.08s: to sleep, you're fine. We're here for
6574.56s: protection. And so that was my
6576.88s: experience then. And you know, that
6578.48s: didn't last. Um eventually that cloud
6581.60s: didn't show up and I never encountered
6583.44s: that being again. But that's that's the
6586.16s: only like somewhat
 What What was this
6588.80s: being wearing? Was it wearing anything?
6591.36s: I don't No, I I it may have been a
6594.32s: uniform or something, but
 I just knew
6596.48s: that its face was very much what we
6598.32s: would call
 reptilian. reptilian.
 Wow.
6601.04s: Yeah. It's not like a lizard. It didn't
6602.96s: have a snout like a lizard or anything
6604.72s: like that, but it looked like someone
6608.08s: who had reptilian
6610.96s: DNA or reptilian heritage and their
6613.84s: bloodline.
 It was upright, you know,
6616.56s: walking bipedal.
 Didn't talk to you at
6619.84s: all.
 No,
 not telepathically. Nothing.
6623.28s: No. No. But I definitely was young and
6625.36s: screaming. I did it.
 What was it doing
6626.40s: to try and wake you up?
 I don't know.
6628.40s: Mhm.
 I don't know.
 It was just there
6630.24s: invading your space.
 Invading my space.
6632.00s: And that that really made me mad
 for
6634.08s: some reason. I just felt anger at it,
6636.64s: but no fear.
 Well,
 other other uh
6640.24s: entities have come up were more benign.
6643.12s: I mean, they were just checking up on
6644.72s: me.
 You've had interactions with
6646.96s: separate entities as well.
 Just two
6648.96s: types that one reptilian
 Yeah.
 entity
6652.48s: I would say reptilian like.
 Yeah.
 Uh and
6654.96s: the other I can't identify because it
6657.20s: was shrouded. It was wearing a cloak.
 A
6659.36s: hood.
 A hood. Yeah. A cloak and a hood.
6662.40s: How tall?
 Um I was lying down, but it
6665.44s: was like I would say like five feet.
6668.32s: Okay.
 You know, not they're not small
6671.12s: and they're not super tall. They're not
6673.12s: Nordic.
 Yeah.
 But um it was a shrouded
6677.36s: wearing wearing a a cloak, a hood, and
6679.84s: kind of shrouded. I couldn't see its
6681.36s: face. Um, I looked at it as carefully as
6685.52s: I could and I seemed to show some
6689.28s: features, but they they were more it it
6692.64s: seemed like it had like facial features
6696.00s: like a humanoid, but not humanoid.
6699.52s: Not like what people describe as Nordic,
6701.36s: which is very humanlike. It wasn't like
6703.44s: that.
 So human humanlike, but not quite.
6706.80s: Yeah.
 Huh.
 Yeah. Yeah. And and these are
6709.76s: the beings that I encountered more
6711.04s: often. You've this has happened more
6713.12s: than once.
 Oh yes. These are my beings
6715.68s: that visit me.
 Really?
 Um and the most
6719.20s: current um time I've was visited was in
6722.32s: in the Tucson area where I live. I just
6724.56s: moved uh away from Charlotte, North
6726.24s: Carolina. Moved into the Tucson area and
6729.60s: they showed up one night and they just I
6732.00s: woke up and they go, "Oh, don't don't
6733.92s: mind us. We just want to let you know
6735.36s: that we know you moved."
 And so yeah.
6739.28s: Whoa. Creepy. You're you're fine. We
6742.64s: know you moved. We just want to let you
6744.16s: know we know you moved.
 What are some
6745.92s: other interactions that you've had with
6747.12s: them? Have they talked to you? Have they
6748.40s: given you information? Have they not
6749.84s: really? No. They just show up.
 They just
6751.52s: show up and they just It seemed like I
6753.36s: was examined or somehow, you know, they
6755.84s: I get the feeling we're just checking up
6757.52s: on you. Go back to sleep. You're fine.
6759.92s: We're just checking to see you're fine.
6761.84s: You know, that kind of thing. It was
6763.76s: almost like monitoring me to see how it
6766.88s: was. Do you feel that you were
6769.60s: potentially part of some hybridization
6771.60s: program?
 Don't know. Is that the feeling
6774.08s: you get? All I know is that I used to
6778.32s: have nose bleeds a lot. Right nostril
6781.12s: nose bleeds. Been having them since
6783.44s: childhood.
6785.36s: Um,
6788.24s: and I just thought that, you know, I was
6790.72s: just susceptible to nose bleeds. Maybe
6792.24s: the air is dry or whatever. I never
6794.64s: associated it with any kind of NHI kind
6796.72s: of calls, but I had that at work
6800.88s: at CIA and I was reaching uh my nose
6804.24s: started bleeding at work and I had some
6806.24s: a box of tissues on the top shelf in my
6809.20s: cubicle. I was reaching for that chairs
6812.40s: had wheels, office chairs, rolled back
6815.76s: and I landed flat on my back
6819.04s: and my co-workers were shocked and I oh
6821.52s: my gosh, what happened to John? you
6822.64s: know, they called medical um and the uh
6826.72s: protective officers showed up, uniform
6828.40s: protective officers. Um
 we call them spo
6832.80s: security protection officers and
6834.64s: uniform.
 Um they showed up to escort a
6837.92s: um medical people. I think it was a
6839.92s: nurse or something. They put me on a
6841.44s: gurnie and off I go to office of medical
6843.84s: services on the first floor and um I was
6847.36s: examined by a doctor. Um, first they
6851.04s: took an X-ray.
6853.28s: I took an X-ray and they got the results
6857.36s: of the X-ray and they go, "Have you ever
6859.44s: had a bad accident?"
6863.04s: Said, "No." So they, "Looks like you had
6866.48s: an accident. Did you ever have surgery?"
6869.12s: "No."
6870.64s: And then said, "Well, let's look at your
6872.08s: nose." And so I lay back down and they
6874.48s: looked at my nose, you know, and they
6877.52s: go, "Have you ever had surgery in your
6880.40s: nostril?" "No." And I said, "Why? Why do
6883.52s: you say that?" Cuz there's a surgical
6885.68s: cut deep in your nostril. It is a
6889.36s: surgical cut
6892.24s: as if I was operated on.
 Wow.
 And oh,
6895.12s: there's some debris there. Can we remove
6897.84s: that debris? And sure, whatever. do
6900.96s: whatever you want and and so let me call
6903.68s: my colleagues. So there were two doctors
6905.44s: now and the other doctor the second
6907.20s: doctor looked in my nose. Oh yeah. And
6910.64s: then they go off and had a sidebar
6912.72s: leaving me out of the conversation
 at
6914.32s: the CIA.
 Yeah. Office of Medical
6916.40s: Services. They were talking sidebar.
6919.44s: They came back and said, "Yeah, we we
6921.20s: want can we extract that this debris?"
6923.92s: Sure. Go ahead. Okay. and we'll extract
6927.12s: it and then we'll we'll we'll cauterize,
6929.52s: you know, we'll they did something to a
6931.92s: nose to close that surgical wound or
6934.32s: whatever
 to stop it from bleeding.
 I
6937.20s: don't know what happened to it um at
6939.28s: all. Um and off they go. They had a
6942.40s: sample of whatever they collected. They
6944.88s: closed the wound. Didn't have any nose
6947.12s: bleeds after that. That's the good news.
6949.20s: So, here I am retired. We're going to
6951.20s: retire. It's in the month of September
6953.76s: of 20, 2009
6956.56s: and I had uh plans to retire on
6958.48s: September the 30th. That was going to be
6959.84s: my last day. So I was going out check
6962.64s: checkout list, right? You got to go here
6964.56s: check out they even go to the library to
6967.36s: make sure you don't owe library fines
6970.56s: cuz they find you. If you check out a
6972.08s: book from the CIA library and you don't
6973.52s: return on time, they find you.
 Okay.
 So
6975.68s: yeah, you're clear for that. D and so
6977.68s: security go there. Oh my gosh, you have
6980.08s: what? Over two dozen compartments. Yeah.
6983.28s: Yeah, I was in the DS&T. What can I say?
6986.16s: People in the DS&T seem to gather a lot
6988.48s: of compartments. Um so forth and so on.
6990.64s: And then I went to medical services and
6992.32s: they were going to uh check off on that
6994.72s: that I reported to medical services.
6996.80s: Then I go, "Oh, by the way, can I get I
6999.92s: had something done here um way back when
7003.68s: um and by then it was um oh like 10
7006.56s: years has have passed and can I get
7010.24s: those records?" I said, "Sorry, um your
7013.68s: medical records are classified. You
7016.48s: cannot have them."
7018.80s: Okay.
 Wait, they classified your own
7021.68s: medical records?
 They told me, "Yeah,
7023.44s: you do not have access to your medical
7025.12s: records. You do not. That That doesn't
7026.96s: make sense.
 It doesn't make sense. Um,
7030.48s: so I couldn't get my medical records cuz
7031.92s: I want to see what they found or if
7033.76s: there anything in there.
 They extracted
7035.20s: something.
 Now, I understand they don't
7037.20s: give you your security file at all that
7039.92s: they keep because um when you go through
7043.92s: CIA reinvestigations, they talk to your
7046.48s: friends and colleagues and neighbors and
7048.16s: they do the whole nine yards thing.
7049.76s: Yeah.
 And it could be detrimental
7051.28s: information from a colleague.
 Sure.
7053.44s: saying, "Yeah, do you know, you know,
7056.00s: John likes to drink too much and I was
7058.08s: at a party and he was drunk." You know,
7059.84s: there could be stuff like that in there.
7061.28s: Mhm.
 Not that I drank too much
 or any
7064.00s: less. Yeah.
 But, you know, there's
7065.76s: detrimental information from your your
7068.40s: colleagues, could be friends or
7069.68s: whatever,
 girlfriends.
7072.00s: Yeah.
 So, all that's in there. So, they
7073.76s: keep that
 and that's that's there I
7076.48s: think for 75 years. I understand.
 Okay.
7079.36s: Yeah.
 So, you know, 75 years from 2009,
7082.24s: you can look at my security file maybe
7083.68s: if you foil it.
 Um, but my medical
7086.48s: records someone given me.
 That's one.
7088.32s: So, years later, let me advance this
7090.08s: story.
7091.84s: Um, Jim Seivan, I knew that he had an
7095.60s: implant. He told me private conversation
7097.92s: before I came out in public. This is
7100.48s: before I came out in public. I knew he
7103.52s: was an experiencer. I knew he had that
7105.20s: encounter which he now freely talks
7106.88s: about. So I knew that background of his
7108.96s: implants and I told him my experience
7112.16s: and so he connected me to a a former CIA
7116.00s: doctor who told me that if you ever
7118.08s: mention my name I will deny that I know
7120.08s: you.
 Okay. What's his name?
 I'm not
7122.24s: going to mention his name. He'll deny
7123.76s: that I know him. So I promise I won't
7126.08s: mention your name. Okay. You get one
7129.04s: guess. Um but you know he's let's talk
7134.00s: I'll get you in touch with him. So, this
7136.16s: doctor, a for former CIA doctor,
7138.16s: interviewed me over the phone. I didn't
7140.40s: see him or anything. Um, but he
7141.84s: interviewed me and we went through my
7144.24s: life history and so forth. And he found
7146.00s: it interesting that I had Cherokee
7148.56s: heritage, my great-grandmother on my
7151.04s: father's side, who's Cherokee, Cherokee
7153.52s: woman. And he said, "Well, my gosh, I
7156.16s: got to put you in a special file here."
7157.84s: He said, "Why is that?" He says, "Well,
7159.20s: there's a almost a one toone correlation
7162.00s: between experiencers and two heritages.
7164.64s: One is Cherokee Indian.
7167.68s: The other is Celtic
7170.16s: and for some reason like experiencers in
7174.88s: who were special operators for the
7176.80s: military or intelligence officers, they
7180.00s: either have Celtic heritage or Cherokee
7182.08s: Indian heritage and they have
7183.36s: experiences with the phenomena. Well,
7185.36s: that's interesting. Right. So, I told
7187.92s: him about my my
7190.72s: um
7192.32s: what they did and he said, "Well, here's
7194.64s: what you do.
7196.64s: You can use my full name. You can here's
7199.20s: my social security number
 and here is um
7203.76s: just tell them that you know me and that
7207.20s: uh I'm still have a contract or some
7209.92s: kind of way to go back to the
7212.80s: intelligence community."
 Sure. let them
7214.64s: know and ask them
7218.00s: do a a HIPPO waiver that is you know
7220.96s: that you can release the files your
7222.48s: medical files to a third party usually
7224.56s: another medical professional have say
7227.92s: you wave your HIPPA and release your
7229.52s: files to me but I won't be able to tell
7232.32s: you what's in them but at least I have
7234.88s: it so okay so that was the end of that
7238.00s: story so he has them
 I imagine so
7240.48s: because I did request John that's so
7242.88s: messed Uh,
 yeah. I I I don't know.
 This
7245.52s: your medical file.
 Yeah, but it's it's I
7249.84s: can't get my medical files.
 That makes
7252.00s: no sense to me.
 I asked Jim Seivan said,
7254.40s: "Were you able to get your medical
7255.60s: files?" No.
7258.32s: Good luck. No.
 So, both of you had
7262.32s: implants taken essentially.
 Yeah. Well,
7266.00s: Jim is public about his he knew that um
7268.96s: I think it was done by a third party
7270.88s: that's not associated with CIA,
 right?
7273.60s: There's another doctor.
 You get one
7276.16s: guess for that doctor's name
 who works
7278.72s: with the CIA doctor. Okay.
 Just gave
7280.48s: away who they are, but you do your own
7282.16s: research. I'm not going to mention their
7283.52s: names. They asked me not to, but you
7285.84s: know, that's the way he got his removed
7287.92s: and
 my understanding is his wife had
7290.16s: one, too, and she kept hers in.
 So,
7293.28s: implants are real. Yeah,
 implants are
7296.16s: real. That's one thing to a takeaway.
7299.84s: Yeah,
 it's not a conspiracy theory. And
7301.68s: hybrids are real. That's not a
7303.28s: conspiracy theory.
7307.12s: And you you said I mean you saying
7310.24s: hybrids are real. That's not a
7311.84s: conspiracy theory. That is not based on
7313.92s: the symposium that you went to. That is
7316.48s: based on other intel.
7320.08s: Mhm.
 That you can't talk about.
 That's
7322.32s: correct. I cannot talk about that. Okay,
7324.40s: I'm going to show you a picture here of
7326.00s: uh there's this lady that reached out to
7327.44s: me. Uh shout out to Sheila. We had a
7331.60s: phone call.
7333.68s: Um
7335.44s: and check this out.
7341.84s: That looks like a tooth.
 This is a
7344.88s: tooth.
 Uh-huh.
7347.36s: Wow. How about that?
 That's in the
7349.20s: jawbone.
 Wow.
7352.64s: the and the dentist who saw this little
7356.64s: diddy and this is clearly
 like that's
7359.76s: not a random object.
 It's got like a
7362.16s: little antenna on it or something.
 See
7364.00s: that little appendage that looks like an
7366.48s: antenna?
 And um the the dentist was like
7371.68s: floored. He's like in my 30 years I've
7373.92s: never seen this. He's like did you feel
7375.68s: it? She's like, "No, but I had all these
7378.16s: dreams of like these things, you know,
7381.20s: taking me and bringing me in."
 So, it
7383.52s: started to make a lot of sense for her.
7384.88s: But that dentist was like, "I don't know
7386.40s: what to do with this." And he couldn't
7387.60s: He's like, "I could never get that out."
7390.48s: Oh, yeah. She still has it.
 Oh, yeah.
7392.48s: Oh, yeah.
 Can't get it out. He's a
7394.08s: 30-year dentist. He's like, I can't I
7395.92s: would not even try to get that out.
 It
7398.16s: would be incredibly painful. And like
7400.00s: Yeah.
 Yeah. And yet she doesn't feel it.
7402.24s: Yeah. It's in the bone itself. That's
7404.24s: why. Yeah.
 Yeah. She's had multiple
7406.08s: X-rays, too.
 Yeah.
 And so, yeah, when I
7408.96s: see things like that, I go, that's,
7411.76s: you know, it's interesting. That's to
7414.08s: say the least. All right, let's get one
7416.64s: more question out of the way here. Last
7418.40s: question for for you and then we'll let
7419.92s: you go. John, you've been so awesome
7421.36s: answering all these questions.
7424.00s: Um, oh, this is cool. This is a cute
7427.28s: question from Gina.
7432.80s: Yeah, maybe you have an opinion on this,
7434.40s: maybe you don't.
7436.72s: Gina asks, "What do you think of the
7438.72s: authenticity of the Lerta file?" Are you
7441.52s: familiar with this?
 I heard of the
7443.52s: Lertafile. I can't claim to be very
7446.24s: familiar with it. If you refresh my
7448.16s: memory, so it is this guy in Sweden who
7450.88s: apparently had a conversation with a
7452.56s: reptilian female. Uhhuh.
 Uh and then she
7455.04s: goes into like all sorts of details on
7458.08s: physics and interactions with beings or
7461.84s: anything. Are you familiar with that at
7464.48s: all or No,
 I am not. So I
 No opinion.
 I
7466.96s: can't answer that question thoroughly.
7468.64s: I'm sorry.
 No, that's fair. I'll give
7470.32s: you mine. Um I think there I am higher
7475.28s: conviction
7476.88s: than I was when I was reading it that
7480.24s: this might have happened.
7482.80s: Um, but that conviction still remains
7485.20s: pretty low.
 Mhm.
 It's just higher than
7487.28s: it was, probably 20% at this point. But
7490.56s: really interesting stuff uh was brought
7492.32s: up. If you ever have a chance to look
7493.52s: into it, it's fun read.
 Mhm.
 As a piece
7496.08s: of fiction, highly entertaining, you
7498.40s: know, and if you take it as truth, I
7499.92s: mean, obviously worlds shattering, but
7502.40s: All right. Well, John, um, where can
7504.96s: people find you? Where can people not
7507.36s: physically, but online? Well, um I only
7510.56s: have uh one uh public social media
7513.92s: presence and that's an X.
 Okay.
 And uh
7517.52s: my X handle I I actually used one of the
7520.08s: radars that the X this is the radar that
7523.04s: actually tracked uh these objects that
7525.76s: uh raise the alert level, these domes of
7528.56s: light. Yeah. On the Russian side. Um,
7531.60s: it's uh
7533.76s: Pura P E C H O R A LPAR L P A R Pura
7541.20s: Alpar.
 Yeah, it's Pura largeed phase
7544.56s: array radar.
 Okay.
 And so yeah, that's
7547.12s: the radar that detected um uh UAP and
7551.68s: that uh caused the deputy secretary of
7555.04s: defense to wonder what the hell is going
7556.32s: on with the Russians.
 That's what with
7558.56s: this radar. That's a fun That's a fun
7561.28s: Easter egg. Also sounds like a spell in
7564.24s: Harry Potter. Bura Elpar. Uh John
7568.32s: Ramirez, you're an absolute gem. It was
7570.40s: so nice getting to know you. Uh so nice
7572.48s: chatting with you. Thank you for gracing
7574.24s: us with your presence and uh being very
7577.04s: open and candid with with all of your

7592.40s: all of this being over actually. I mean,
7594.08s: I just do I wish the NHA would do
7596.40s: something.
 Just end it all for us. Just
7599.04s: show up.
 Yeah.
 I don't know if they will
7601.12s: or not. Or just government disclose
7603.20s: something.
 Well, if you ever talk to any
7605.36s: of them, tell them that they got an open
7607.28s: spot here on the podcast. We'd love to
7609.76s: have them in the skiff. All right.
7611.44s: Thanks, John.
7613.44s: Oh,
 and that's it, sir.
