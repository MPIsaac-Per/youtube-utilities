1.76s: When I was around 13 years old, my older
5.12s: sister had just gotten her driver's
7.04s: license and we used to wait for my dad
9.92s: to fall asleep and we'd basically steal
12.72s: the car and go out joy riding at night.
15.28s: Well, this one night we went out. On the
18.32s: way back, my sister's like, "Let's just
20.40s: go the back roads. I feel like going by
22.24s: my friend's house." So, we're going the
24.56s: back roads and on the right hand side in
28.56s: somebody's front yard,
30.88s: we see this giant
34.16s: black disc. This thing is about the half
37.12s: the size of a house in height, about the
40.72s: width of a house. My sister pulls over.
43.60s: We're just looking at each other
45.36s: incredulously, and I decided to get out
49.84s: of the car. I start making a beline
53.04s: towards this object and I get about 2530
56.00s: yards from it and this thing just hops
58.56s: up off the ground in a split second. It
61.04s: was on the ground and then a second
63.04s: later it's like 2 ft off the ground and
65.76s: it starts to slowly ascend in front of
69.12s: me. It's completely quiet, gets to the
71.60s: top of the tree line and then in a split
75.60s: second it just shoots off into the
77.20s: clouds.
79.68s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
81.52s: another episode of the Area 52 podcast.
84.72s: My name is Chris Ramsey and today we're
87.20s: going to be taking a very, very deep
89.52s: dive into the special operations manual
92.64s: of a group known as the Majestic 12. And
96.96s: if you're wondering what the Majestic 12
98.56s: is, fret not. gentlemen behind me here
100.96s: on these little Polaroids are actually
102.96s: part of a top secret group that was put
105.60s: together to control, contain, and
108.88s: explore the UFO
112.48s: extraterrestrial biological entity
115.04s: presence that has been communicating and
118.56s: interacting with our planet since the
120.96s: late 1940s. I highly suggest you go
124.08s: check out the video that I've already
125.52s: done kind of deep diving into each
127.44s: individual on this list and the purpose
129.84s: of the Majestic 12 themselves and what
132.56s: their role is in all of this. The manual
135.36s: allegedly came out in 1954, but was not
138.88s: leaked until 1994
141.76s: to a gentleman by the name of Don
143.28s: Berliner. There were Trix negatives
145.12s: mailed to Mr. Don Berliner postmarked on
147.76s: March 7th, 1994. Now, the document we
151.68s: are going to be reading is a replica of
154.48s: the one that was photographed by an
157.04s: unknown person that was submitted on,
159.60s: you know, this reel of photos. The MJ12
162.16s: debate goes pretty deep among UFO
164.32s: researchers and people flip-flop back
166.40s: and forth. I've been looking forward to
168.88s: reading through this document, and I
170.32s: can't wait to do it with you all today.
172.56s: Before we do that, a few little things I
176.24s: must say. First of all, here's a word
178.64s: from our sponsors. At Area 52, we run
181.68s: things a little differently. We
183.68s: investigate the unknown and chase down
185.44s: leads most won't touch. And when it
187.52s: comes to launching our own products,
188.96s: like our brand new MJ12 collection,
193.92s: we don't do it alone. We use Shopify,
196.80s: our official platform for all things
198.56s: Area 52. Think of it as a command center
201.28s: for any operation, selling, shipping,
203.44s: marketing, even launching collections
205.28s: inspired by government secrets. It's
207.76s: fast and powerful and works across every
210.56s: channel, YouTube, Instagram, Google, you
213.04s: name it. But the real game changer,
218.00s: Shopify Sidekick. It's like having an
220.80s: embedded agent inside your business. You
223.20s: could talk to it, ask it to build pages,
225.12s: give it feedback. It'll even analyze
227.28s: your sales and tell you what's working.
229.84s: I used it while prepping the MJ12 drop
232.08s: and it felt like I had a classified
234.24s: assistant with clearance to everything.
237.28s: If you're ready to go from idea to
239.04s: operation, start your mission now at
241.28s: shopify.com/eria52
244.08s: or scan the QR code on the screen.
246.40s: That's shopify.com/eria52.
249.60s: Your mission starts here.
252.72s: All right, folks. We paid the bills. If
255.52s: you don't mind, leave a like, subscribe,
258.56s: hit the notification bell, leave us a
261.12s: favorable review on Spotify or iTunes or
264.80s: wherever it is you listen to these
266.16s: podcasts. It would be greatly
267.60s: appreciated and it goes a really long
269.52s: way. So, there is a researcher by the
271.60s: name of Ryan Woods who spent most of his
273.36s: career really looking into this and
275.20s: proving or trying to disprove the
277.12s: authenticity of the MJ12 documents. him
279.52s: along with Stan Freriedman and many
281.52s: others had their go at these specific
284.48s: documents. Ryan Woods I think went the
286.96s: deepest and he has his report available
289.28s: on special operationsmanual.com which
291.68s: I'll leave the link to below where he
293.52s: details his forensic analysis on some of
295.92s: the things that might help prove the
297.28s: authenticity of these documents which
299.28s: would be absolutely earthshattering.
301.20s: Before we get into reading, I'm just
302.88s: going to go over a few of the bullet
305.04s: points that Ryan Woods has found through
306.96s: his research proving the authenticity of
309.12s: these documents. So, in short, forensic
311.28s: analysis of the language, font, and
313.12s: original photographic film prove that
315.68s: the document was produced in or around
318.08s: 1954. And that's according to Wood's
320.48s: research and expert witnesses he's
322.40s: contacted uh at the National Archive.
324.72s: The manual, however, did not become
326.40s: public until 1994. We know this where it
328.64s: was leaked to Mr. Beriner. Now, in the
331.76s: manual, they specifically talk about
333.68s: Area 51, S4, site 4. Now, Bob Blazar
338.40s: only came public in 1989, so that would
340.56s: have been a full 5 years prior to this
342.56s: document coming out, which does raise a
344.32s: little bit of suspicion, obviously. But
346.80s: put that aside for a second, here are
348.48s: some things that corroborate the 1954
352.72s: production of this document. So the
354.56s: manual was sent anonymously to
356.16s: Donberiner 1994, but the documents were
358.24s: sent as images on a film and that film
360.16s: was authenticated
361.84s: to 1954 based on its type of
364.88s: underdeveloped 35 mm Trix. Number two,
368.88s: the detailed packaging procedures for
370.88s: the recovered EBEs and craft
373.28s: specifically mention craft tape, not
375.60s: duct tape, which is accurate to 1954
379.20s: shipping methods. Okay. The packaging
382.40s: procedures spell out screwdriver as two
385.60s: words, which was customary in 1954, but
388.72s: not today. Okay. Similarly, first aid
392.56s: was capitalized in 1954, but the US
395.36s: custom changed to lowercase first aid in
398.24s: the late 1950s.
400.32s: Similarly, again, the control sentence
402.40s: on one of the pages specifies NMEX for
405.92s: New Mexico when the modern abbreviation
407.92s: would be NM. Number three, the only typo
410.80s: in the document is desicant, spelled
413.20s: with two C's, uh, not two S's,
416.00s: suggesting the document underwent
417.36s: thorough manual editing, but not
419.44s: computer-based editing, since a spell
421.44s: checker would have caught the mistake
422.72s: automatically. Next up, the letter Z.
425.28s: The letter Z is raised from the other
427.60s: text, indicating the printed document
430.00s: came from a hot lead printing press
432.16s: appropriate to 1954 and not a more
435.36s: modern monotype press which does not
437.92s: have the same problem with a raised Z.
440.88s: The Z button was not used frequently as
442.96s: the other letters and unfrequently used
445.52s: letters like the Z got crud on the brass
448.72s: slugs in the press leading to the letter
451.20s: being raised above the others.
454.00s: Very interesting. So, the raised Z
456.16s: matches other Army manuals at the time.
458.96s: Okay. If you want to read more detailed,
461.44s: obviously more granular research that um
465.60s: Mr. Ryan Woods has put together, head
467.76s: over to that website if you're still
469.36s: feeling a little bit skeptical. But for
472.56s: now, I invite you to put that skepticism
476.64s: aside, suspend your disbelief, and come
479.44s: with me as we dive deep into 1954
484.64s: and take a look at the special
486.24s: operations manual for extraterrestrial
489.12s: entities and technology recovery and
491.76s: disposal
493.36s: of the Majestic 12. Cover letters got
495.60s: all types of warning. Again, this is a
497.92s: transcription of the original. Here it
500.40s: says this is a top secret magic eyesonly
502.96s: document containing compartmentalized
504.64s: information essential to the national
506.64s: security of the United States. Eyes only
508.48s: accessed to the material herein is
510.88s: strictly limited to personnel possessing
512.56s: magic 12 clearance level. Examination or
515.52s: use by an unauthorized personnel is
517.20s: strictly forbidden and punishable by
519.12s: federal law. Okay.
522.00s: Which would be interesting, wouldn't it?
523.44s: It's interesting that they put that
524.96s: little thing in there. If you read this
527.28s: and you're not authorized,
529.76s: it's punishable by law. But then you
532.72s: would have to admit that the program
534.48s: exists.
536.48s: So it is kind of silly that they write
538.16s: that. First and foremost, I will say
539.92s: that is a silly thing. Please arrest
544.00s: someone for reading this and charge them
546.32s: with reading this specific document.
548.00s: That would be great. Uh that would be a
549.36s: great way to get disclosure. And by the
550.88s: way, if you want to watch another deep
552.00s: dive into the MJ12 stuff, I highly
554.08s: suggest you go subscribe to my friend uh
556.72s: UAP Gerb. He goes deeper than anybody
559.60s: else into the military's involvement
561.60s: with extraterrestrials. So, the first
563.68s: page here uh talks about the removal
565.52s: and/or replacement of pages attached to
567.52s: the document requires written a written
569.20s: authorization from the Magic 12
570.88s: operations officer and will be recorded
572.56s: by the documents records officer for
574.40s: each instance. Okay. Gives you a few
576.80s: dates here. nothing we're going to deep
579.76s: dive into right now. Another warning
582.88s: page. Um, here we have a bit of an index
585.68s: of what's to come in this document. So,
589.92s: section one, the project purpose and
592.16s: goals.
593.84s: One, the scope. This manual has been
596.24s: prepared especially for Majestic 12
598.16s: units. Its purpose is to present all
600.72s: aspects of Majestic 12 so authorized
602.88s: personnel will have a better
604.48s: understanding of the goals of the group,
607.28s: be able to more expertly deal with
608.96s: unidentified flying objects,
610.80s: extraterrestrial technology, and
612.80s: entities, and increase the efficiency of
615.28s: future operations. Number two, general
619.28s: MJ12 takes the subject of UFOs. Now, UFO
623.36s: was the proper acronym that people would
625.92s: use to describe UFOs back then. So, if
628.08s: you're ever searching the CIA archive
629.84s: and if you type in UFOs, you probably
631.68s: won't get much, but UFOB uh you'll get
635.04s: quite a bit uh quite a bit of results
637.36s: popping up. And if you're wondering what
639.20s: does the B stand for? It's simply
641.60s: object. So, they use the O and the B.
643.68s: So, like a EUOB, the O and the B would
646.00s: stand for object. MJ12 takes the subject
648.32s: of the UFO's extraterrestrial technology
651.20s: and extraterrestrial biological entities
653.60s: very seriously and considers the entire
655.52s: subject to be a matter of the very
657.20s: highest national security.
659.76s: For that reason, everything relating to
661.52s: the subject has been assigned the very
663.52s: highest security classification. Three
666.08s: main points will be covered in this
668.24s: section. A the general aspects of MJ12
671.60s: to clear up any misconceptions that
673.52s: anyone may have. B the importance of the
676.32s: operations and C the need for absolute
679.04s: secrecy in all phases of the operations.
682.08s: Three security classifications.
684.96s: All information relating to MJ12 has
687.12s: been classified magic eyes only and
689.52s: carries a security level two points
691.36s: above that of top secret. The reason for
694.08s: this has to do with the consequences
696.08s: that may arise not only from the impact
698.00s: upon the public should the existence of
700.24s: such matters become general knowledge
702.00s: but also the danger of having such
704.40s: advanced technology as has been
706.72s: recovered by the air force fall into the
709.20s: hands of unfriendly foreign powers. No
712.16s: information is released to the public
713.60s: press and the official government
715.20s: position is that no such special group
717.76s: as MJ12 exists. Also interesting to note
720.64s: that the badge that Bob Lazar had while
723.04s: working at Majest or working at S4 had
726.40s: the letters Maj on the badge. This is
728.80s: not an official replica of the badge,
731.04s: but in the new Project Gravit um movie
734.08s: that's coming out, S4, the Bob Lazar
736.32s: story. Uh they they do replicate that
738.56s: badge. So you can see what that looked
739.84s: like according to Bob's memory. Number
742.00s: four, history of the group. Operation
745.36s: Majestic 12 was established by special
747.68s: classified presidential order on 24th of
750.00s: September 1947 at the recommendation of
753.20s: Secretary of Defense James V. Foresttol
755.76s: and Dr. Vanavar Bush, chairman of the
758.24s: joint research and development board.
760.48s: Operations are carried out under a top
762.56s: secret research and development
764.16s: intelligence group directly responsible
766.48s: to the president of the United States.
768.16s: The goals of the MJ12 group are as
771.04s: follows. A recovery for scientific study
774.64s: of all materials and devices of foreign
777.60s: or extraterrestrial manufacturer uh that
780.16s: may become available. Such material and
782.24s: devices will be recovered by any and all
784.72s: means deemed necessary by the group.
788.32s: That's terrifying right off the bat,
790.32s: just like any means necessary.
793.44s: B. The recovery for scientific study of
796.16s: all entities and remains of entities not
799.12s: of terrestrial origin which may become
801.12s: available through independent action by
802.96s: those entities or by misfortune or
805.68s: military action. C. The establishment
808.80s: and administration of top secret teams
811.60s: to accomplish the above operations. So,
814.96s: so far, you know, recovering absolutely
819.52s: everything that has to do with aliens by
822.16s: any means necessary. Pretty much your
824.00s: standard clause for a top secret, you
826.00s: know, group that moves in the shadows
828.48s: and works on black budget only.
832.00s: D. the establishment and administration
834.24s: of special secure facilities located at
836.80s: locations within the continental borders
838.88s: of the United States for the receiving,
840.64s: processing, analysis, and scientific
843.04s: study of any and all materials and
845.36s: entities classified as being
847.20s: extraterrestrial origin by the group of
849.52s: the special teams. Now, we do know of
851.92s: some of these bases located around the
854.16s: United States, namely S4 or site 4 where
857.36s: Bob Lazar worked, but we also hear about
859.60s: Dulce uh in New Mexico, about the
862.40s: famous, you know, Phil Schneider sort of
864.40s: underground firefight that happened with
866.72s: the EBEs and probably possibly many
870.00s: other places in the United States uh
872.32s: that have underground military
874.80s: facilities harboring
877.60s: um you know, and deconstructing, reverse
879.36s: engineering and working on a lot of
881.12s: these projects. E, establishment and
884.08s: administration of covert operations to
886.24s: be carried out in concert with central
888.88s: intelligence to affect the recovery for
891.68s: the United States of extraterrestrial
893.20s: technology and entities which may come
895.28s: down inside the territory of or fall
898.88s: into the possession of foreign powers
900.88s: and f the establishment and maintenance
902.72s: of absolute top secrecy concerning all
904.72s: the above operations. Number five, the
908.24s: current situation. It is considered as
911.20s: far as the current situation is
912.64s: concerned that there are few indications
914.80s: that these objects and their builders
916.88s: pose a direct threat to the security of
918.80s: the United States despite the
920.40s: uncertainty as to their ultimate motives
922.72s: in coming here. Certainly, the
925.12s: technology possessed by these beings far
927.04s: surpasses anything known to modern
928.64s: science. Yet, their presence here seems
931.60s: to be benign, and they seem to be
933.68s: avoiding contact with our species, at
935.60s: least for the present. Several dead
938.48s: entities have been recovered along with
940.40s: a substantial amount of wreckage and
942.40s: devices from the downed craft. All of
944.96s: which are now under study at various
947.04s: locations. No attempt has been made by
949.60s: the extraterrestrial entities either to
952.00s: contact authorities or to recover their
953.92s: dead counterparts or downed craft. Even
956.48s: though one of the crashes was the result
958.56s: of a direct military action,
962.16s: the greatest threat at this time arises
964.24s: from the acquisition and study of such
966.00s: advanced technology by foreign powers
968.00s: unfriendly to the United States. It is
970.72s: for this reason that the recovery and
972.32s: study of this type of material by the
974.16s: United States has been given such a high
976.88s: priority. Now, I completely understand
980.08s: that. That is something I think we can
981.76s: all get behind in 1954. You know, this
984.96s: is cold war era, post World War II.
987.44s: Tensions were still incredibly high as
990.16s: we had just developed the first nuke and
992.16s: deployed it. And now we're all kind of
994.64s: sitting back and wondering, do the
996.00s: Russians have this? Are they going to
997.68s: fight back and retaliate? You know, so
999.92s: this type of technology in the wrong
1001.84s: hands could have been absolutely
1004.16s: devastating. Could still be devastating,
1006.08s: but especially back then. It's so crazy
1008.24s: to just let your mind
1010.96s: sit in 1954
1014.88s: with, you know, this type of material if
1017.12s: you were read into it. It is one thing
1019.28s: to be told today or shown even that UFOs
1024.40s: exist and that aliens are real, right?
1026.96s: But we have so much preliminary
1030.64s: cognitive padding when it comes to the
1033.28s: UFO subject through science fiction,
1037.12s: through even newspapers, TV shows,
1040.56s: podcasts like the one you're listening
1042.08s: to right now, that the amount of shock
1046.08s: would have to be
1048.64s: dampened. Like the shock of something
1052.08s: like this back then would have been
1055.60s: insurmountable
1057.20s: and unfathomable for any anybody for
1061.36s: anybody. 1948
1064.08s: was
1066.24s: when the helicopter was made public was
1069.20s: flown publicly.
1071.68s: So in 1947 the helicopter was actually
1075.28s: advanced military technology. So, you're
1078.24s: going from 1948 seeing a helicopter for
1081.04s: the first time
1082.96s: to potentially being face to face
1086.64s: with beings from
1090.08s: a non-early origin and their technology.
1093.68s: I mean, it's just it must shatter your
1096.40s: paradigm so much. Chapter 2,
1099.60s: introduction.
1101.36s: Six, the scope.
1104.00s: 6 A. This operation manual is published
1106.72s: for the information and guidance of all
1108.56s: concerned. It contains information on
1110.80s: determination, documentation, collection
1113.52s: and disposition of debris, devices,
1116.32s: crafts and occupants of such craft as
1119.20s: defined as extraterrestrial technology
1121.84s: or extraterrestrial biological entities,
1125.68s: EBEs, in section two of this chapter. B.
1129.20s: Appendix 1-1A contains a list of current
1132.40s: references including technical manuals
1134.96s: and other available publications
1136.72s: applicable to these operations and C
1138.64s: appendix 2 contains a list of personnel
1141.12s: who comprise the Majestic 12 group seven
1144.72s: forms and records. So forms used for
1147.20s: reporting and operation are listed in
1148.88s: appendix one section two of chapter 2
1152.56s: the definition and data 8 general
1156.64s: extraterrestrial technology is defined
1159.04s: as followed. A aircraft identified as
1163.36s: not manufactured in the United States or
1166.08s: any terrestrial foreign powers including
1169.44s: experimental military or civilian craft.
1172.40s: Aircraft in this category are generally
1174.64s: known as U unidentified flying objects
1177.92s: or UFOs.
1180.08s: Such aircraft may appear as one of
1182.00s: several shapes and configurations and
1184.72s: exhibit extraordinary flight
1186.56s: characteristics.
1188.32s: B. objects and devices of unknown origin
1192.40s: or function manufactured by processes
1196.00s: or of materials not consistent with
1199.12s: current techn technology or scientific
1201.28s: knowledge.
1203.84s: Okay. Well, that's interesting. See,
1206.16s: they define extraterrestrial technology
1208.32s: here as a devices of unknown origin or
1211.60s: function manufactured by processes or
1214.24s: materials not consistent with current
1215.84s: technology or scientific knowledge. So,
1217.68s: they're not saying that the ET
1220.64s: technology
1222.72s: couldn't be manufactured here on Earth.
1224.80s: C. Wreckage of any aircraft thought to
1227.68s: be of extraterrestrial manufacturer or
1229.92s: origin. Such wreckage may be the result
1232.16s: of accidents or military action.
1235.76s: D. Materials that exhibit unusual and or
1238.80s: extraordinary characteristics not
1240.48s: consistent with not consistent with
1242.24s: current technology or scientific
1243.76s: knowledge. And then ebees are described
1246.32s: as a creatures humanoids or otherwise
1250.72s: whose evolutionary process responsible
1253.12s: for their development are demonstrabably
1256.56s: different from those postulated or
1258.80s: observed in homo sapiens.
1261.60s: All right, next we're going to go into
1263.36s: the description of the craft and then
1264.88s: the description of the aliens.
1268.40s: Nine. Description of craft. documented
1270.48s: extraterrestrial craft UFOs are
1272.48s: classified in one of four categories
1274.24s: based on general shape as follows. Now,
1276.72s: this is interesting. We got Skywatcher
1279.36s: and the whole team, you know, coming up
1281.12s: with nine classifications for UFOs,
1284.80s: which by the way,
1287.28s: not one of them is a disc. We've seen
1290.08s: flying saucers and discs since the late
1292.48s: 1940s. And yet one of the nine
1294.96s: classifications of UFOs that they have,
1298.80s: none of them are discs.
1301.60s: So a elliptical or discshaped.
1304.96s: This type of craft is of metallic
1306.80s: construction and dull aluminum in color.
1309.76s: They have the appearance of two pie pans
1311.84s: or shallow dishes pressed together and
1314.24s: may have a raised dome on the top or
1317.04s: bottom. No seams or joints are visible
1320.08s: on the surface, giving the impression of
1322.16s: one piece construction. Discs are
1324.64s: estimated from 50 to 300 ft in diameter.
1328.16s: And the thickness is approximately 15%
1331.12s: of the diameter, not including the dome,
1334.24s: which is 30% of the disc diameter and
1337.44s: extends another 4 to 6 ft above the main
1340.56s: body of the disc.
1343.68s: Really interesting here that we're
1345.20s: talking about a potential 300 ft disc.
1348.72s: Now 1954,
1351.36s: what makes them think other than having
1354.48s: direct eyewitness
1357.04s: that one of these craft would be 300 ft?
1360.48s: Yeah. Does that mean they've recovered a
1362.88s: 300 ft craft? Now, I believe a few years
1365.84s: ago, Ross Coltard had alluded to some
1368.48s: type of giant UFO that was way too big
1370.80s: for them to move. So they had to build a
1373.12s: base around it.
 So big they built a
1375.44s: building over it in a country outside of
1377.68s: the United States of America.
 Since
1379.84s: then, people have been scouring the
1381.52s: internet looking for buildings that
1383.20s: might be under heavy military protection
1385.52s: that stand out as potentially harboring
1388.56s: this giant UFO.
1391.28s: And recently in Korea, there is this
1394.00s: building, and I'll put it up here,
1395.92s: that's 265 ft wide, built of stone and
1399.20s: concrete, and surrounded by an 8-ft
1401.12s: barbed wire fence. The signs mark it as
1404.00s: belonging to the South Korea's Aviation
1406.24s: Authority, and it has navigational
1408.80s: equipment mounted on top. Other models
1411.04s: of this antenna platform can be seen
1413.04s: elsewhere in South Korea and the
1414.56s: equipment for them does not extend below
1416.32s: the platform. Meaning the equipment is
1418.08s: only built a top the building in
1420.00s: question. The purpose of the building
1421.84s: itself is unexplained. Now the building
1424.40s: itself looks to be like 50 to 70 years
1426.64s: old. Very very interesting that this is
1429.52s: a big round building a top a mountain
1435.20s: which you could potentially you know
1436.80s: build into. I don't know. Is that what
1438.56s: we're talking about here? We're talking
1439.68s: about a 300 ft craft. That would be
1441.92s: cool. That would be a cool connection.
1443.52s: We carry on with the description of the
1445.52s: UFO.
1447.28s: The dome may or may not include windows
1449.68s: or ports. And ports are present around
1452.24s: the lower rim of the disc. In some
1454.40s: instances, most discshaped craft are
1457.52s: equipped with lights on the top and
1459.44s: bottom and also around the rim. These
1462.40s: lights are not visible when the craft is
1464.08s: at rest or not functioning. There are
1466.24s: generally no visible antenna or
1468.16s: projections. Landing gear consists of
1470.48s: three extendable legs ending in circular
1473.60s: landing pads. When fully extended, this
1476.16s: landing gear supports the main body 2 to
1478.40s: 3 ft above the surface at the lowest
1481.04s: point. A rectangular hatch is located
1484.32s: along the equator or on the lower
1486.24s: surface of the disc. So, we're talking
1489.04s: about standard flying saucer sci-fi type
1493.20s: discs here. Interesting that they said
1495.52s: there's no protrusions or antennas. Uh
1497.84s: the UFO that Bob worked on, I think was
1500.80s: specifically said to have, I think, a a
1504.96s: 4, three or 4 foot antenna above it. B.
1508.24s: Fuselage or cigar- shaped. We hear about
1510.80s: these a lot from pilots, by the way.
1512.48s: These specific ones. Documented reports
1515.12s: of this type of craft are extremely
1516.96s: rare. Air Force radar reports indicate
1519.44s: they're approximately 2,000 feet long
1523.04s: and 95 feet thick.
1526.56s: What?
1530.24s: 2,000 ft?
1533.20s: That's massive.
1535.84s: My god. Let's calculate this in American
1538.80s: metrics. How many fridges wide is 2,000
1542.08s: ft? Um, if we assume a standard fridge
1545.04s: is about 3 ft wide, then 2,000 ft would
1548.32s: be roughly 677 fridges lined up side by
1551.76s: side.
1553.28s: 677
1555.52s: fridges long, folks. That is incredible.
1559.84s: That is incredible. And apparently they
1561.68s: do not operate in the lower atmosphere.
1564.72s: Okay. Very little information is
1566.72s: available on the performance of these
1568.32s: craft, but radar reports have indicated
1570.24s: speeds in excess of 7,000 m an hour.
1574.24s: They do not appear to engage in the
1576.24s: violent and erratic maneuvers associated
1578.48s: with the smaller types.
1580.80s: Violent.
1583.76s: What? I assume they're only being
1586.80s: violent because we're attacking them
1588.32s: first. I don't know.
1591.44s: C ovoid or circular shape orbs if you
1595.28s: will. This type of craft is described as
1598.00s: being shaped like an ice cream cone
1603.20s: being rounded at the large end
1606.88s: and tapered to a near point on the other
1610.00s: end. Okay. Wait, so this is like a
1612.80s: teardrop shape. This is what actually
1615.60s: John Ramirez on the latest podcast kind
1617.68s: of described too. Very interesting.
1620.40s: egg-shaped, if you will. They're
1622.24s: approximately 30 to 40 feet long, and
1624.32s: the thick end diameter is approximately
1626.40s: 20% of the length. There is an extremely
1629.84s: bright light at the pointed end. And
1633.04s: this craft usually travels point down.
1636.00s: They can appear to be any shape from
1638.32s: round to cylindrical depending upon the
1640.96s: angle of observation. often sightings of
1643.84s: this type of craft are elliptical craft
1647.12s: seen at an inclined angle or edge on. So
1651.04s: that is interesting too that the angle
1653.28s: of which you're looking at this
1654.96s: eggshaped craft might change your you
1658.64s: know analysis of what that craft might
1660.40s: be. And that I think is fair to say, you
1663.92s: know, from Commander Fraver to Chris
1666.16s: Bledsoe to all these other cases, we
1668.32s: hear about either a tic tac, oval,
1670.88s: cigar, round. Maybe that's just the
1674.08s: angle at which we're seeing it,
1676.56s: especially if there are no seams. You
1678.88s: know, looking at it from a certain angle
1681.12s: and plus the bright light might give off
1683.52s: that effect. Very interesting. And
1685.20s: finally, D. Air foil or triangular
1688.32s: shaped. Whoa. This is 1954, folks. We're
1692.56s: not talking I mean, I don't think we're
1695.60s: talking about TR3A or TR3B, but maybe
1700.16s: 1954 is an interesting time to be
1702.64s: talking about triangular shaped craft.
1705.12s: This craft is believed to be new
1707.04s: technology due to the rarity and recency
1710.08s: of observations.
1712.00s: Radar indicates an isosles triangle
1714.48s: profile, the longest side being nearly
1716.80s: 300 ft in length. Little is known about
1719.36s: the performance of these craft due to
1721.12s: the rarity of good sightings. They are
1723.44s: believed to be capable of high speeds
1725.20s: and abrupt maneuvers similar to or
1727.44s: exceeding the performance attribute
1729.28s: attributed to the types of ANC. Whoa.
1732.88s: Interesting that they say this is a new
1734.72s: type of craft. So, new to them.
1738.08s: Or perhaps it's their own craft and
1739.84s: they're kind of inserting it into here
1741.68s: to, you know, help the propagation of uh
1746.32s: of some type of blue beam project. Who
1748.32s: knows? 10. Description of
1750.56s: extraterrestrial biological entities.
1753.60s: Here we go, folks. We're talking about
1755.36s: aliens. Examinations of remains
1757.92s: recovered from wreckage of UFOs indicate
1760.80s: that EBEs may be classified into two
1765.28s: distinct categories as follows.
1768.64s: EBBE type one. These entities are
1771.28s: humanoid and might be mistaken for human
1773.92s: beings of the oriental race if seen from
1776.64s: a distance. They are bipedal,
1780.16s: 5 to 5'4 in in height and weigh 80 to
1784.48s: 100 lb.
1786.24s: They're just little fellas.
1788.48s: They're just little fellas really.
1791.28s: Proportionally, they are similar to
1792.88s: humans, although the cranium is somewhat
1794.96s: larger and more rounded. The skin is a
1797.44s: pale, chalky yellow in color, thick, and
1801.12s: slightly pebbled in appearance. Slightly
1804.32s: pebbled. The eyes are small, wideset,
1808.40s: almond shaped with brownish black irises
1812.16s: with very large pupils. The whites of
1815.52s: the eyes are not like that of humans,
1817.36s: but have a pale gray cast. The ears are
1821.84s: small and set low on the skull. The nose
1825.76s: is thin and long,
1828.64s: and the mouth is wider than in humans
1832.64s: and nearly lipless. There is no apparent
1835.68s: facial hair and very little body hair,
1838.32s: that being very fine and confined to the
1840.72s: underarm and groin area. The body is
1844.08s: thin and without apparent body fat, but
1846.64s: the muscles are welldeveloped.
1849.92s: Oh, they're
1852.24s: slightly jacked. The hands are small
1854.72s: with four long digits, but no opposable
1857.44s: thumb. The outside digit is jointed in a
1860.96s: manner as to be nearly opposable,
1864.24s: and there is no webbing between the
1866.72s: fingers as in humans.
1869.76s: The legs are slightly but noticeably
1872.72s: bowed and the feet are somewhat spled
1876.32s: and proportionally large.
1880.00s: That is one of the strangest
1882.72s: descriptions. EBE type two. And by the
1885.84s: way, type one seems to be the
1890.32s: EBEs that were discovered at Aztec. If
1893.28s: you look at William Steinman's book UFO
1896.16s: crash at Aztec,
1898.72s: it talks about 16 bodies, I believe,
1901.04s: that were found within this 100 foot
1903.92s: craft. The craft was intact. The bodies
1907.12s: were referred to as small children,
1909.04s: which is also what Bob Lazar referred to
1912.40s: them as at S4. They called them the kids
1915.36s: uh because they didn't look like the
1917.04s: typical grays. They looked like small
1920.08s: humanoid but have like larger heads and
1924.08s: were smaller but had like tiny facial
1927.20s: features like humanlike. And in Aztec it
1929.68s: was even said that they had perfect
1931.04s: teeth. EB type two. These entities are
1934.40s: humanoid but differ from type one in
1936.48s: many respects. They are bipedal 3t 5 in
1940.32s: to 4'2 in in height and weigh about 25
1943.36s: to 50 lb.
1945.52s: Oh,
1947.12s: you can just throw them. Proportionally,
1949.68s: the head is much larger than humans or
1952.56s: type 1 ebees. The cranium being much
1954.80s: larger and elongated. The eyes are very
1957.28s: large, slanted, and nearly wrap around
1960.08s: the side of the skull. They are black
1963.20s: with no whites showing. There is no
1966.32s: noticeable brow ridge. And the skull has
1969.76s: a slight peak that runs over the crown.
1973.28s: The nose consists of two small slits
1976.00s: which sit high above the mouth, the
1978.56s: slit-like mouth. There are no external
1981.44s: ears. The skin is a pale bluish gray
1984.88s: color, being somewhat darker on the back
1987.52s: of the creature and is very smooth and
1990.48s: fine-sellled. There is no hair on either
1993.04s: the face or the body, and these
1994.48s: creatures do not appear to be mamalon.
1997.60s: The arms are long in proportion to the
1999.60s: legs, and the hands have three long
2002.16s: tapering fingers, and a thumb, which is
2004.88s: nearly as long as the fingers.
2008.00s: The second finger is thicker than the
2009.84s: others, but not as long as the index
2011.68s: finger. The feet are small and narrow,
2014.16s: and the four toes are jointed together
2016.08s: with a membrane.
2018.40s: It is not definitely known where either
2020.88s: type of creature originated, but it
2022.80s: seems certain that they did not evolve
2024.80s: on Earth. It is further evident,
2026.56s: although not certain, that they may have
2028.48s: originated on two different planets. So,
2031.44s: it seems like type one definitely is
2034.40s: more of a humanoid type alien that
2037.92s: couldn't necessarily pass for a real
2040.16s: human, but maybe a closer cousin to homo
2044.08s: sapiens.
2045.60s: And type two seems to be your typical
2049.28s: sort of skinny bob,
2052.80s: 50 pounds.
2055.92s: Also, tridactyl.
2059.04s: I thought four fingers. No, they say
2060.72s: three. Very interesting. Tridactyl gray
2063.44s: beings.
2065.12s: Are these the same beings that are
2066.72s: present in Peru? Time will tell. All
2070.24s: right, moving on. The description of the
2073.36s: ET technology. This is super
2075.60s: interesting. Now, we're talking about
2076.72s: what are we talking about here? Probes,
2078.16s: wands. The following information is from
2081.60s: preliminary analysis reports of wreckage
2084.72s: collected from crash sites of
2086.00s: extraterrestrial craft 1947 to 1953.
2089.28s: Pause. 1953. We're talking about the
2092.24s: Kingman, Arizona crash. That might be
2094.96s: the reference here.
2097.60s: Excerpts from which are quoted verbatim
2099.68s: to provide guidance as to the type of
2101.68s: characteristics of material that might
2103.68s: be encountered in future recovery
2105.84s: operations.
2107.84s: A initial analysis of the debris from
2110.72s: the crash site seems to indicate that
2112.72s: the debris is that of extraterrestrial
2115.60s: craft which exploded from within and
2118.56s: came into contact with the ground with
2120.40s: great force completely destroying the
2122.16s: craft. The volume of the matter
2123.76s: indicates that the craft was
2124.88s: approximately the size of a medium
2126.48s: aircraft. Although the weight of the
2128.32s: debris indicates that the craft was
2129.92s: extremely light for its size. B.
2133.36s: Metallergical analysis of the bulk of
2135.44s: the debris recovered indicates that the
2137.44s: samples are not composed of any material
2139.92s: currently known to terrestrial science.
2143.60s: C. The material tested possesses great
2146.48s: strength and resistance to heat in
2148.40s: proportion to its weight and size, being
2150.88s: stronger by far than any materials used
2153.28s: in military or civilian aircraft at
2155.76s: present. That's an interesting point
2158.00s: because the 410 whistleblower also said
2161.12s: that these things were extremely heat
2163.36s: resistant which made it nearly
2165.20s: impossible to work with. D. Much of the
2168.16s: material having the appearance of
2169.68s: aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium
2172.24s: sheeting displays none of the
2174.00s: characteristics of either metal
2175.52s: resembling instead some kind of unknown
2177.76s: plastic-like material.
2180.16s: E solid structures and substantial beams
2183.52s: having a distinct similar similarity in
2186.40s: appearance to very dense grain-free wood
2190.96s: was very light in weight and possesses
2193.60s: tensile and compression strength not
2196.48s: obtainable by any means known to modern
2199.52s: industry. Whoa.
2202.48s: F. None of the material tested displayed
2204.88s: measurable magnetic characteristics or
2207.12s: residual radiation. No radiation, not
2210.80s: magnetic.
2212.56s: G. Several samples were engraved or
2215.12s: embossed with marks and patterns. These
2217.84s: patterns were not readily identifiable,
2219.84s: and attempts to decipher their meaning
2221.60s: has been largely unsuccessful.
2224.56s: H. Examination of several apparent
2227.04s: mechanical devices, gears, etc. revealed
2229.84s: little or nothing of their function or
2232.32s: methods of manu or methods of
2234.72s: manufacturer. This is really interesting
2236.80s: stuff. The grain-free wood is a really
2239.28s: interesting way to describe something.
2242.08s: You know, if you were to think
2242.96s: grain-free wood or some type of plastic,
2246.40s: even Bob Lazar said that the craft that
2249.12s: he worked on, he wasn't convinced was
2251.52s: metallic.
2253.60s: It felt cold to the touch, but that
2255.44s: doesn't mean it was metal. You know, he
2257.52s: maybe some type of stone or lightweight
2259.92s: granite or something. All these
2262.56s: descriptions of this of these materials
2264.96s: seem a little foreign. And um we hear
2267.20s: about the the material that you you know
2269.04s: you bend and it goes back to what it
2271.04s: originally was. You know back then we
2273.68s: also didn't have carbon fiber. You know
2277.20s: we didn't have any of this advanced sort
2279.28s: of metallic alloys that we have today.
2281.92s: So maybe today with a keener eye and
2284.40s: more sufficiently advanced tech, we'd be
2286.64s: able to properly, you know, determine
2289.04s: what this stuff is or at least the
2291.12s: contractors Rathon and Lockheed and all
2295.36s: the above probably already know this.
2297.68s: Next up, we got the press blackout
2299.60s: number 12. This is chapter 3 and
2301.52s: recovery operations. So what they go
2303.20s: through when they recover one of these
2304.64s: crashed UFOs.
2307.04s: Great care must be taken to preserve the
2308.80s: security of any location where
2310.80s: extraterrestrial technology might be
2312.64s: retrievable for scientific study.
2314.88s: Extreme measures must be taken to
2316.96s: protect and preserve any material or
2318.96s: craft from discovery, examination, or
2321.28s: removal by civilian agencies or
2323.60s: individuals of the general public. It is
2326.48s: therefore recommended that a total press
2328.48s: blackout be initiated whenever possible.
2331.52s: If this course of action should not
2333.44s: prove feasible, the following cover
2335.52s: stories are suggested for release of to
2337.92s: the press. The officer in charge will
2340.16s: act quickly to select the cover story
2342.16s: that best fits the situation. It should
2344.64s: be remembered when selecting a cover
2346.32s: story that official policy regarding
2348.48s: UFOs is that they do not exist.
2353.84s: A official denial. Whoa, this is really
2356.64s: interesting. I'm having a flashback
2360.72s: to a discussion I had with Lou Alzando
2365.04s: on the podcast when we had Lou back in
2366.88s: January. Lou said something really
2368.96s: interesting there. He said
 there's a
2370.64s: saying we have uh
2374.08s: first of all you deny everything. You
2376.00s: admit nothing and then you make counter
2377.28s: accusations.
 Well,
2380.08s: interesting.
2381.92s: A official denial. The most desirable
2384.32s: response would be that nothing unusual
2386.00s: has occurred. By stating that the
2387.76s: government has no knowledge of the
2389.04s: event, further investigation by the
2390.64s: public press may be forstalled. B.
2394.40s: Discredit witnesses.
2397.20s: If at all possible, witnesses will be
2399.12s: held in communicado until the extent of
2402.08s: their knowledge and involvement can be
2403.76s: determined. Witnesses will be
2405.52s: discouraged from talking about what they
2407.52s: have seen and intimidation may be
2410.00s: necessary to ensure their cooperation.
2412.64s: If witnesses have already contacted the
2414.72s: press, it will be necessary to discredit
2417.28s: their stories. This can best be done by
2420.72s: the assertion that they have either
2423.36s: misinterpreted natural events, are the
2425.92s: victims of hysteria or hallucinations,
2429.44s: or are the perpetrators of hoaxes.
2435.92s: All of the above we've heard of, by the
2438.48s: way, especially the hoax part when you
2440.64s: look into things like not only the Gulf
2443.12s: Breeze situation in Florida, but Aztec,
2446.88s: probably the most monumental and well
2450.80s: covered crash retrieval incident in the
2453.76s: history of the United States, was
2456.40s: dismissed as a hoax immediately before
2458.80s: the press got a hold of it by the FBI.
2463.04s: And when looking into it, yeah, you
2465.20s: realize there's a lot more to it. I'm
2467.68s: leaving you guys breadcrumbs, by the
2469.36s: way. See, deceptive statements. It may
2472.64s: become necessary to issue false
2474.72s: statements to preserve the security of
2476.80s: the site. Meteors, down satellites,
2479.44s: weather balloons, and military aircraft
2481.20s: are all acceptable alternatives.
2482.96s: Although in the case of the downed
2485.04s: military aircraft statement, care should
2487.20s: be exercised not to suggest the aircraft
2489.60s: might be experimental or secret, as this
2492.00s: might arouse more curiosity of both the
2494.72s: American and foreign press. Statements
2497.04s: issued concerning contamination of the
2498.80s: area due to toxic spills from trucks or
2501.04s: railroad tankers can also serve to keep
2503.76s: unauthorized or undesirable personnel
2506.64s: away from the area.
2510.24s: Sneaky. Super sneaky. 13. Secure the
2513.84s: area.
2515.36s: The area must be secured as rapidly as
2517.60s: possible to keep authorized personnel
2520.00s: from infiltrating the site. The officer
2522.40s: in charge will set up a perimeter and
2524.40s: establish a command post inside the
2526.32s: perimeter. Personnel allowed on the site
2528.64s: will be kept to the absolute minimum
2530.48s: necessary to prepare uh the craft or
2533.12s: debris for transport and will consist of
2535.04s: military security forces. Local
2537.36s: authorities may be pressed into service
2539.44s: on traffic and crowd control. Under no
2542.64s: circumstances will local official or law
2545.28s: enforcement personnel be allowed inside
2547.04s: the perimeter and all necessary
2548.96s: precautions should be taken to ensure
2550.72s: that they do not interfere with the
2552.48s: operation. Now, that's interesting
2554.40s: because also, you know, I go back to the
2556.96s: Aztec crash because it's something that
2558.64s: I'm looking into right now, but local
2561.84s: law enforcement apparently was at the
2564.16s: site. This is 1948, 8 months after
2566.40s: Roswell. Things were still a little
2568.08s: dicey on the recovery side, I'm
2569.52s: guessing. And so, you know, they doubled
2571.28s: down on their security tactics,
2573.12s: apparently. So, a a perimeter. It is
2575.84s: desirable that sufficient military
2577.36s: personnel be utilized to set up a
2578.96s: perimeter around the site large enough
2580.48s: to keep both unauthorized personnel and
2582.24s: the perimeter personnel from seeing the
2584.16s: site.
2585.92s: We have uh we've had incidences in 1947
2589.12s: according to you know uh Philip Corso
2593.20s: apparently the perimeters weren't well
2596.08s: established and people were just kind of
2597.76s: onlookers were kind of seeing you know
2599.52s: this this thing happened in real time
2602.16s: once the site is contained regular
2603.92s: patrols will be set up along the
2605.36s: perimeter to ensure complete security
2607.12s: and electronic surveillance will be
2608.64s: utilized to augment the patrols
2611.28s: perimeter personnel will be equipped
2613.04s: with hand communication and automatic
2615.52s: weapons with live ammunition. Personnel
2618.72s: working at the site will carry sidearms.
2620.56s: No author unauthorized personnel will be
2622.56s: allowed into the secure area. B. Command
2626.40s: post. Ideally, the command post should
2628.80s: be as close to the site as is practical
2631.36s: to efficiently coordinate operations.
2634.48s: As soon as the command post is
2635.84s: operational, contact with the Majestic
2637.52s: 12 group will be established via secure
2639.60s: communications. C. Area sweep. The site
2642.72s: and surrounding area will be cleared of
2644.88s: all unauthorized unauthorized personnel.
2647.44s: Witnesses will be debriefed and detained
2649.60s: for further evaluation by MJ12. Under no
2652.24s: circumstances will witnesses be released
2654.32s: from custody until their stories have
2657.04s: been evaluated by MJ12 and they have
2659.36s: been thoroughly debriefed.
2662.48s: D. Situation evaluation. A preliminary
2666.00s: evaluation of the situation will be
2668.16s: completed and a preliminary report
2670.32s: prepared. The MJ12 group will then be
2672.96s: briefed on the situation at the earliest
2675.28s: possible opportunity. The MJ12 group
2678.24s: will then make a determination as to
2680.32s: whether or not a MJ12 red team or OPNAC
2685.76s: team will be dispatched to the area.
2689.44s: What is an OPNAC
2692.32s: team? An opac
2695.36s: team refers to a group within the office
2697.44s: of the chief of naval operations opav
2700.08s: that focuses on specific naval
2702.00s: operations core functions. The N denotes
2704.56s: a particular area of responsibility such
2706.64s: as operations, intelligence or
2708.80s: logistics. The C signifies a specific
2711.20s: command or division within that area.
2713.52s: These teams are integral to the Navy's
2715.52s: organizational structure, ensuring
2717.20s: effective management and coordination of
2719.28s: various naval operations. Well, looks
2721.20s: like chat GPT steered me wrong a little
2723.28s: bit here. OPNAC is actually rumored to
2726.16s: possibly be an acronym said to stand for
2729.36s: Operations National Advisory Committee
2732.56s: or variations like Operational National
2735.12s: Command. It's not an officially
2736.80s: recognized organization. And so in UFO
2739.20s: Lord, it's sometimes described as like a
2741.28s: highlevel military or intelligence unit
2744.64s: involved in crash retrievalss,
2747.04s: extraterrestrial contact or special
2748.96s: access programs or SAPs. So if I make
2751.36s: reference mistakenly to naval
2753.44s: intelligence, well, forgive me, but that
2755.76s: doesn't mean the Navy isn't involved.
2757.60s: Once again, folks, the Navy inserts
2760.08s: itself into the crash retrieval
2761.76s: narrative quite deeply. As mentioned
2764.48s: again by John Ramirez, former CIA
2766.96s: officer, he says the highest
2770.32s: most top secret program which he was
2773.20s: refused to be read into had to do with
2776.48s: underwater recovery. Let's go into
2779.60s: section two, the technology recovery,
2782.64s: removal and transport.
2785.12s: And this includes um entities as well.
2788.08s: As soon as a communication is
2789.28s: established, removal and transport of
2790.96s: all material will commence under order
2793.04s: from MJ12. A documentation. If the
2796.32s: situation permits, care should be taken
2798.16s: to document the area with photographs
2800.08s: before anything is moved. The area will
2802.48s: be checked for radiation and other toxic
2805.44s: agents. If the area cannot be kept
2808.00s: secure for an extended period of time,
2810.16s: all material must be packed and
2812.40s: transported as quickly as possible to
2814.56s: the nearest secure military facility.
2817.12s: This will be accomplished by covered
2819.36s: transport using little traveled roads
2821.68s: wherever possible. B complete or
2825.12s: functional craft. Craft are to be
2828.64s: approached with extreme caution if they
2830.56s: appear functional as serious injury may
2832.96s: result from exposure to radiation and
2834.88s: electrical discharges. If the craft is
2837.68s: functioning but appears to be abandoned,
2839.92s: it may be approached only by specially
2842.32s: trained MJ12 red team personnel wearing
2844.96s: protective clothing. Any device that
2847.28s: seems to be functioning should also be
2849.20s: left to MJ12 red team disposal. Complete
2852.08s: craft and parts of craft too large to be
2854.24s: transported by covered transport will be
2856.56s: disassembled.
2858.08s: If this can be accomplished easily and
2860.48s: quickly if they must be transported
2863.20s: whole or on open flatbed trailers, they
2866.88s: will be covered in such a manner as to
2869.04s: camouflage their shape.
2872.72s: Whoa.
2875.44s: So, they're actively camouflaging their
2877.84s: shape during transport. That's
2880.40s: interesting
2882.00s: because obviously seeing a saucer on a
2884.08s: flatbed, I mean, kind of gives it away.
2887.28s: Wow. Maybe now is a good time to remind
2889.60s: you that our Majestic 12 MJ12 merch line
2893.20s: is now available. collection comes
2896.08s: complete with hats, patches, pins,
2900.48s: sweaters, t-shirts, journals, pencils,
2904.08s: so many different things. We worked so
2905.68s: hard on this collection. We've been
2907.12s: actually working on this for the past I
2908.96s: think like six or eight months. Um, very
2912.64s: very proud of it. Get it while you can.
2914.72s: Get it while it's hot. Available at
2916.56s: area52.shop.
2918.40s: We carry on. See, now we go on to
2921.36s: extraterrestrial and biological
2922.72s: entities. EBEs must be removed to a top
2925.44s: secret facility as quickly as possible.
2927.84s: Great care should be taken to prevent
2929.28s: possible contamination by alien
2930.96s: biological agents.
2933.92s: Dead EBEs should be packed in ice at the
2937.28s: earliest opportunity to preserve
2939.04s: tissues. Should live EBEs be
2941.76s: encountered, they should be taken into
2943.92s: custody and removed to a top secret
2946.80s: facility by ambulance.
2950.56s: Every effort should be taken to ensure
2952.16s: the EBE's survival. Personnel
2954.32s: involvement with EBEs, alive or dead,
2956.48s: must be kept to an absolute minimum. See
2958.40s: chapter 5 for more detailed information
2960.48s: dealing with EBEs. We'll get to chapter
2963.52s: 5 in a second. That is crazy.
2967.76s: Imagine you're an ambulance driver.
2971.36s: If there's an ambulance driver out there
2972.96s: who remembers driving around, please
2975.60s: reach out to us. Cleansing the area.
2978.80s: Once all material has been removed from
2980.56s: the central area, the immediate area
2982.40s: will be thoroughly inspected to make
2983.84s: sure that all traces of extraterrestrial
2986.16s: technology have been removed. In the
2988.32s: case of a crash, the surrounding area
2990.32s: will be thoroughly gone over several
2992.40s: times to ensure that nothing has been
2994.08s: overlooked. The search area involved may
2997.76s: vary according to local conditions at
3000.08s: the discretion of the officer in charge.
3002.48s: When the officer in charge is satisfied
3004.00s: that no further evidence of the event
3005.84s: remains at the site, it may be
3007.52s: evacuated.
3010.00s: Also, something in Diana Pulka's book
3012.56s: which was interesting, they talked about
3015.44s: her being brought to this crash site in
3018.64s: New Mexico by who we now know uh as Tim
3021.84s: Taylor, this person, you know, that
3023.92s: worked somehow in the government. Um,
3026.48s: but at this very crash site, there
3028.40s: seemed to be a ton of just like debris,
3032.00s: aluminum debris from like tin cans and
3034.24s: stuff. And it was explained to her that
3036.80s: that's actually how they cover up a lot
3039.60s: of this stuff. So instead of finding all
3042.08s: the little parts, it's much easier to
3044.64s: cover it up with a bunch of junk and
3046.56s: then people metal detecting just, you
3048.32s: know, you're never going to find
3049.28s: anything. So
3052.00s: 16 special or unusual conditions. The
3054.72s: possibility exists that extraterrestrial
3056.32s: craft may land or crash in heavily
3058.00s: populated areas where security cannot be
3060.48s: maintained or where large segments of
3062.24s: the population and the public press may
3064.32s: witness these events. Contingency plan
3067.28s: MJ194904P78
3070.96s: top secret eyes only should be held in
3072.64s: readiness should the need to make a
3074.88s: public disclosure become necessary. Now
3077.04s: that was referenced in the original um
3080.16s: briefing documents that we read through
3082.00s: if you want to check that out. Okay,
3084.48s: here
3086.08s: this is interesting because these are um
3090.80s: basically items,
3093.28s: the description and condition of the
3095.92s: items,
3098.08s: the code
3100.24s: and then
3102.48s: the receiving facility.
3105.44s: Now if we look at aircraft intact or
3108.32s: operational
3109.92s: S4
3111.60s: intact devices
3113.84s: like electronic devices or machines S4
3118.32s: damaged device S4 power plant so devices
3122.72s: and machines and fragments which are
3124.64s: possible propulsion units fuels and etc.
3128.88s: S4
3130.48s: identified and unidentified fragments S4
3134.96s: however
3136.72s: non- mechanical non electronic materials
3140.24s: of a support nature such as clothing
3143.36s: personal belongings or organic
3146.48s: ingestables
3150.48s: went to the blue lab WP61
3154.08s: what is that they're saying here that
3156.64s: blue lab blue means means uh like the
3159.76s: being like a blue lab is also slang for
3162.64s: like the lab handling blue or the
3164.88s: non-human intelligence. So the living
3167.36s: nonhumans would go to the department of
3169.68s: naval u intelligence at some some level
3173.76s: and then the deceased ones would go to
3175.36s: blue lab. My guess would be battel. Uh
3179.92s: that's where the EBO scientist said that
3182.80s: where he had worked or where the bodies
3184.16s: were being kept the dead ones and then
3186.08s: the living ones would be uh operations
3188.32s: of naval intelligence at some point.
3192.08s: Uh and then media would go to building 2
3195.20s: at KB88 and then any device
3198.96s: um any weapon would go to S4 as well. So
3201.60s: S4 being the major facility there. Here
3205.12s: they just show basically packing slips
3207.28s: for if you're shipping this stuff and
3209.20s: what that should look like. The box
3212.08s: closure is sealed with a gummed craft
3214.16s: tape. Here's the craft tape that they
3215.44s: were referring to initially. MJ form
3217.92s: 1-007
3219.44s: is placed in a sealed manila envelope
3221.36s: marked magic 12 access only. It then
3224.24s: shows here a diagram. There's a picture
3226.16s: here of the original picture of the
3227.76s: diagram of like what the boxes will look
3229.84s: like, how to handle those, how to take
3232.32s: them out. All very serious stuff. Uh,
3235.68s: pretty standard, I guess, when dealing
3237.28s: with sensitive materials. Here we go.
3240.16s: Section one, living organisms. The
3242.32s: EBEEs, baby.
3244.96s: Scope. This section deals with the
3246.72s: encounters with living extraterrestrial
3248.56s: biological entities or EBEs. Such
3250.88s: encounters fall under the jurisdiction
3252.72s: of MJ12,
3254.56s: OPNAC, BBS-01,
3258.08s: and will be dealt with by the special
3260.40s: unit only. This section details the
3262.88s: responsibilities of persons or units
3264.80s: making the initial
3267.36s: contact. Whoa.
3270.88s: This is something I got to learn if
3272.24s: we're having one of these little gray
3273.52s: fellas on this podcast one day.
3275.84s: Encounters. Encounters with EBEs may be
3279.04s: classified according to one of the
3280.80s: following categories.
3282.96s: Encounters. A. Encounters initiated by
3285.28s: EBEs. Possible contact may take place as
3288.32s: a result of overtures by the entities
3290.80s: themselves.
3292.32s: In these instances, it is anticipated
3294.48s: that encounters will take place at
3296.64s: military installations or other obscure
3299.92s: locations selected by mutual agreement.
3303.28s: Such meetings would have the advantage
3305.04s: of being limited to personnel with
3306.88s: appropriate clearance away from public
3308.88s: scrutiny. Although it is not considered
3311.68s: very probable, there also exists the
3314.08s: possibility that EBEEs may land in
3316.56s: public places without prior notice. In
3319.28s: this case, OPNAC team uh will formulate
3323.04s: cover stories for the press and prepare
3325.36s: briefings for the president and chiefs
3327.28s: of staff. So here they're just basically
3330.16s: telling us that they're already
3331.36s: communicating with these EBEs and that
3333.84s: they already have a deal with them which
3336.64s: corroborates what was said by Dan Burish
3340.72s: or Dan Crane about the initial contact
3344.56s: with the J-Rod uh that there was some
3347.12s: type of deal or exchange program
3348.72s: happening. And it also corroborates this
3350.72s: idea that in 19 I think it was 54 maybe
3353.84s: 56 uh this idea of the Gata treaty made
3356.88s: by Eisenhower where he met with the
3359.04s: aliens but then al also the meeting in I
3362.72s: think 1965
3364.96s: at the Hollowman Air Force Field uh the
3368.48s: landing there another meeting occurred
3370.16s: with taller entities I don't know very
3374.16s: interesting B encounters as a result of
3376.88s: downcraft contact with survivor Drivers
3379.20s: of accidents or craft down by natural
3381.28s: events or military action may occur with
3384.00s: little or no warning. In these cases, it
3387.36s: is important that the initial contact be
3389.68s: limited to personnel to preserve
3392.00s: security. Civilian witnesses to the area
3394.64s: will be detained and debriefed by MJ12.
3397.52s: Contact with EBEs by military personnel
3400.24s: not having MJ12 or OPNAC clearances is
3403.28s: to be strictly limited to action
3404.96s: necessary to ensure the availability of
3407.04s: the EBEs for study by the OPNAC team.
3409.92s: Now remember, OPNAC is the ones that
3411.44s: deal with them when they're alive.
3414.80s: 24. Isolation and custody. Okay, little
3419.44s: custody battle for these little guys.
3421.92s: EBBE will be detained by whatever means
3424.56s: are necessary and removed to a secure
3426.64s: location as soon as possible.
3428.48s: Precautions will be taken by personnel
3430.56s: coming in contact with EBEs to minimize
3433.04s: the risk of disease as a result of
3434.96s: contamination by unknown organisms.
3437.92s: If the entities are wearing space suits
3440.40s: or breathing apparatus of some kind,
3442.32s: care should be exercised to prevent
3444.40s: damage to these devices. While all
3446.80s: efforts should be taken to assure the
3448.32s: well-being of the EBEs, they must be
3450.80s: isolated from any contact with
3452.48s: unauthorized personnel. While it is not
3455.52s: clear what provisions or amenities might
3457.92s: be required by non-human entities, they
3461.20s: should be provided if possible.
3464.64s: The officer in charge of the operation
3466.40s: will make these determinations as no
3468.32s: guidelines now exist to cover this area.
3470.88s: And I'm sure they've since come up with
3472.64s: a lot of these guidelines, you know,
3474.32s: following the 1996
3476.56s: crash and visitation of these tiny
3479.76s: little aliens in this town of Argginia,
3481.84s: Brazil, you know, where people who came
3484.64s: in contact, namely one person who came
3486.64s: in contact with one of these beings
3488.48s: ended up dying from what was written on
3491.52s: his auto autopsy, general infection,
3495.20s: you know, due to contact was I mean, so
3497.92s: as much as I'd love to have one of these
3499.52s: little guys on the podcast, I will I
3502.48s: I'll I'll be wearing a spacuit for sure
3504.96s: or it will one of us will both of us
3507.12s: might uh severe precautions will be
3509.76s: taken in order to assure both of our uh
3513.20s: survival. B injured or wounded entities
3516.56s: will be treated by a medical personnel
3518.40s: assigned to the OPNAC team. If the team
3520.96s: medical personnel are not immediately
3522.56s: available, first aid will be
3524.16s: administered by medical core personnel
3526.72s: at the initial site. Since little is
3529.84s: known about EBE's biological functions,
3532.32s: aid will be confined to the stopping of
3534.40s: bleeding, bandaging of wounds, and
3536.48s: spinting of broken limbs. No medications
3538.56s: of any kind are to be administered as
3540.88s: the effect of terrestrial medications on
3542.96s: non-human biological systems are
3544.88s: impossible to predict. As soon as the
3547.92s: injuries are considered stabilized, the
3549.76s: EBEs will be moved by close close
3552.48s: ambulance
3554.00s: or other suitable uh conveyance to a
3557.60s: secure location.
3559.76s: C. In dealing with any living
3562.08s: extraterrestrial biological entity,
3564.72s: security is of paramount importance.
3567.92s: All other considerations are secondary.
3570.56s: Although it is preferable to maintain
3572.16s: the physical well-being of any entity,
3574.00s: the loss of EBE life is considered
3576.40s: acceptable if conditions or delays to
3579.20s: preserve that life in any ways
3580.88s: compromises the security of operations.
3584.40s: Basically saying
3586.88s: making sure everything is under wraps is
3589.04s: more important than the lives of these
3590.88s: EBEs. That's how important this program
3594.08s: is to these folks.
3596.40s: By some sheer miracle, this beautiful
3599.12s: little life that comes from another star
3601.12s: system and another species entirely
3603.84s: makes its way here to communicate with
3605.76s: us. It is more important for us
3609.44s: that no one finds out about it than that
3611.76s: the life of this EBE continues to exist.
3616.48s: Sad times indeed.
3619.68s: I would not like to be the one making
3621.28s: that call. D. Once the OPNAC team has
3623.60s: taken custody of the EBEs, their care
3625.52s: and transportation to designated
3626.96s: facilities become the responsibility of
3628.72s: OPNAC personnel. Every cooperation will
3631.68s: be extended to the team in carrying out
3633.76s: duties. OPNAC team personnel will be
3636.48s: given top priority at all times
3639.36s: regardless of their apparent rank or
3641.68s: status. No person has the authority to
3644.48s: interfere with the OPNAC team in the
3646.24s: performance of its duties by special
3648.24s: direction of the president of the United
3649.92s: States. Whoa.
3652.16s: So even the lowest level OPNAC security
3655.28s: personnel supersedes absolutely any
3658.32s: government entity in existence. Now
3660.96s: we're going to go into non-living
3662.32s: organisms. All right. So the scope
3664.56s: ideally retrieval for scientific study
3666.80s: of cadaavvers and other biological
3668.88s: remains will be carried out by medical
3670.64s: personnel familiar with this type of
3672.48s: procedure. Familiar.
3677.04s: Huh.
3678.32s: probably talking about um either Vanavar
3681.52s: Bush or uh Dr.
3684.64s: Bronc is it? These are the guys that
3686.96s: apparently you know were dealing with
3689.44s: the deceased Ebans or EBEs. Because of
3693.68s: security considerations, such
3695.52s: collections may need to be done by
3696.96s: non-medical personnel. The section will
3700.08s: provide guidance for retrieval,
3701.68s: preservation, and removal of cadaavvers
3703.92s: and remains in the field. Oo, dark
3707.28s: retrieval and preservation. A the degree
3710.64s: of decomposition of organic remains will
3713.36s: vary depending on the length of time the
3716.16s: remains have been lying in the open
3718.00s: unprotected and may be accelerated by
3720.48s: both local weather conditions and action
3722.48s: by predators. Gross. Therefore,
3726.00s: biological specimens will be removed
3728.16s: from the crash site as quickly as
3729.68s: possible to preserve the remains in as
3731.92s: good a condition as possible. A
3734.56s: photographic record will be made of all
3736.96s: remains before they are removed from the
3739.28s: site.
3741.52s: Again, the gross sort of thought comes
3743.76s: to mind of like
3746.24s: some coyote just like having dinner in
3749.68s: the desert unexpectedly being like,
3751.12s: "Ooh, a snack." B. Personnel involved
3755.04s: with this type of operation will take
3756.56s: all reasonable precautions to minimize
3758.40s: phys physical contact with the cadaavver
3760.80s: cadaavvers or remains being retrieved.
3763.84s: Surgical gloves should be worn or if
3766.00s: they are not available, wool or leather
3767.68s: gloves may be worn provided they are
3769.60s: collected for decontamination
3771.28s: immediately after use. Shovels and
3773.92s: entrenching tools may be employed to
3775.76s: handle remains provided caution is
3778.08s: exercised to be certain no damage is
3780.72s: done to the remains.
3782.96s: Remains will be touched with bare hands
3785.04s: only if no other means of moving them
3787.52s: can be found.
3789.44s: All personnel and equipment involved in
3791.04s: recovery operations will undergo
3792.48s: decontamination procedures immediately
3794.48s: after those operations have been
3796.24s: completed.
3798.88s: Wonder if they talk about the smell as
3800.96s: well. Remains will be preserved against
3803.04s: further decomposition as equipment and
3805.20s: conditions permit. Cadaavvers and
3807.28s: remains will be bagged or securely
3809.44s: wrapped in waterproof coverings.
3812.16s: Tarpolins or foul weather gear may be
3815.52s: used for this purpose if necessary.
3817.76s: Remains will be refrigerated or packed
3820.48s: with ice if available.
3822.88s: All remains will be tagged or labeled
3825.36s: and the time and date recorded. Wrapped
3828.00s: remains will be placed on stretchers or
3830.00s: insealed containers for immediate
3831.68s: removal to a secure facility. Small
3835.36s: detached pieces and material scraped
3837.84s: from solid surfaces will be put in jars
3841.20s: and other small capped containers if
3843.36s: available. Containers will be clearly
3845.36s: marked as to their contents and the time
3848.00s: and date recorded. Containers will be
3849.52s: refrigerated or packed with ice as soon
3851.04s: as possible and removed to a secure
3852.96s: facility. So, we know that there are
3855.68s: photos then, right? That's what they
3857.12s: keep saying with the down craft, with
3858.80s: the EBEs.
3860.48s: photographs are suggested to be taken.
3863.76s: Right. So Danny Shehan had mentioned
3868.08s: in one of our podcasts
3871.28s: that
3873.04s: that he was made aware
3876.00s: of a photo at Project Blue Book that
3879.44s: looked like this that was taken when the
3882.40s: crash
3884.32s: uh UFO was like in a hill and there were
3887.76s: people um photographing it. There was
3890.48s: like people holding like those real
3892.16s: cameras and filming it. So that checks
3894.56s: out to what Danny Sheihin was saying
3896.32s: about it which is pretty cool. Bit of a
3898.64s: piece of anecdotal corroborative
3901.28s: evidence if you will. But hey, it's what
3903.28s: we got to work with, you know. Here we
3905.20s: got an image of different crafts which
3907.04s: is really interesting.
3909.76s: Interesting that some of them do show
3911.44s: seams though when they said no seams.
3914.96s: Chapter six guide to UFO identification.
3918.16s: The UFO guide follow-up investigations.
3921.20s: A UFO report is worthy of follow-up
3923.92s: investigation when it contains
3925.20s: information to suggest that positive
3927.04s: identification with a well-known
3928.32s: phenomenon may be made or when it
3930.64s: characterizes an unusual phenomenon. The
3933.84s: report suggests almost immediately
3936.00s: largely by the coherency and clarity of
3938.24s: the data that there is something of
3940.24s: identification and/or scientific value.
3943.20s: In general, reports which should be
3944.72s: given consideration are those that
3946.32s: involve several reliable observers
3948.96s: together or separately and which concern
3951.28s: sightings of greater duration than one
3954.72s: quarter minute.
3956.88s: Exception should be made to this when
3959.28s: circumstances attending the report are
3960.96s: considered to be extraordinary. Special
3963.52s: attention should be given to reports uh
3965.36s: which give promise to a fix on the
3968.00s: position and those reports involving
3970.08s: unusual trajectories. You know, it is
3972.48s: interesting that like even if you are
3975.68s: skeptically inclined, you have to
3977.84s: imagine that the Air Force or whoever is
3980.64s: receiving phone calls from an I because
3982.64s: rest assured people do receive phone
3984.80s: calls.
3986.32s: You know, whether or not the events are
3988.16s: happening, people are calling and saying
3990.08s: that there are events happening whether
3992.16s: it's misidentification or whatever it
3994.16s: is, right? So, these people call in.
3996.24s: Well, there has to be some type of
3997.92s: structure for screening these calls and
4000.24s: they would be foolish
4003.52s: based on multiple, you know, data points
4005.92s: of eyewitnesses to dismiss anything,
4009.68s: right? So, there has to be So, this
4011.44s: would make sense that they have some
4012.56s: type of protocol. Um, you know, if
4014.64s: you're out there doubting any of this is
4016.08s: real, um, you would be hardressed to
4018.48s: think that they don't have some type of
4020.16s: protocol for screening, you know,
4022.64s: possible foreign adversarial
4025.84s: aerial uh, phenomena, you know, they
4028.32s: they need to know. So, yeah. So, the
4031.68s: duration of the sighting more than less
4034.00s: than 15 seconds. That is really
4035.84s: interesting. Okay. Each UFO beat uh case
4038.56s: should be judged individually, but there
4040.72s: are a number of rules of thumb uh under
4044.16s: each of the following headings which
4046.00s: should prove helpful in determining the
4047.76s: necessity for following up an
4049.68s: investigation. Okay. So, if you're out
4051.44s: there folks and you're wanting to uh you
4054.64s: know call the Air Force or MJ12 or
4056.88s: whatever it may be with your concerns
4058.64s: about a sighting, make sure you take
4060.80s: these rules of thumb into consideration.
4064.72s: A, the duration of sighting. So, the
4066.48s: duration of sighting uh when it's less
4068.16s: than 15 seconds, the probabilities are
4070.40s: great that it is not worthy of a
4072.24s: follow-up. As a word of caution,
4074.08s: however, should a large number of
4075.84s: individual observers concur on an
4077.52s: unusual sighting of a few second
4079.12s: durations, it should not be dismissed.
4081.76s: B. The number of persons reporting the
4084.24s: sighting. Short duration sightings by
4086.32s: single individuals are seldom worthy of
4088.24s: follow-up. two or three competent
4089.92s: independent observations carry the
4091.52s: weight of 10 or more simultaneous
4094.80s: individual observations. As an example,
4097.52s: 25 people at one spot may observe a
4099.92s: strange light in the sky. This, however,
4102.32s: has less weight than two reliable people
4104.56s: observing the same light from different
4106.16s: locations. In the latter case, a
4108.72s: position fix is indicated. Ooh,
4111.04s: interesting. C. Distance from location
4113.60s: of sightings to nearest field unit.
4116.64s: Reports which meet the preliminary
4118.32s: criterion stated above should all be
4120.56s: investigated if their occurrence is in
4122.16s: the immediate uh operating vicinity of
4124.64s: the squadron concerned. For reports
4126.96s: involving greater distances, follow-up
4129.12s: necessity might be judged as being
4131.20s: inversely proportional to the square of
4133.84s: the distances concerned. For example, an
4136.72s: occurrence of 150 mi away might be
4138.72s: considered to have four times the
4140.24s: importance other things being equal than
4143.84s: one that is 300 m away.
4147.28s: That's also interesting.
4150.08s: So things that are in direct vicinity of
4153.52s: military, let's say, hold a higher
4156.72s: importance just because of location.
4160.72s: D. Reliability of person or person's
4162.88s: reporting. In establishing the necessity
4165.12s: of follow-up investigation, only
4166.64s: short-term reliability of individuals
4168.32s: can be employed. Short-term reliability
4170.16s: is judged from the logic and coherency
4172.40s: of the original report by the age and
4174.72s: occupation of the person. Particularly
4177.12s: particular attention should be given to
4178.72s: whether the occupation involves
4180.00s: observation, reporting or technical
4182.32s: knowledge. Right? So, a young vital
4186.24s: pilot might be someone they pay more
4190.16s: attention to or give more importance to
4194.00s: than
4196.00s: an old YouTuber like myself, let's say.
4199.36s: Uh, E, number of individual sightings
4201.52s: reported. Two completely individual
4204.24s: sightings, especially when separated by
4206.08s: a mile or more, constitutes sufficient
4208.08s: cause for follow-up, assuming previous
4210.24s: criterion have not been violated. F. The
4214.16s: value of obtaining additional
4216.08s: information immediately. If the
4218.56s: information cannot be obtained within 7
4220.48s: days, the value of such information is
4222.48s: greatly decreased. It is of great value
4225.12s: to obtain additional information
4226.72s: immediately if previously stated
4228.56s: criteria have been met. Often if
4231.68s: gathered quickly, weather conditions,
4233.52s: angular speed, changes in direction, uh
4236.24s: duration are sufficient for immediate
4238.80s: evaluation. If investigation is
4240.88s: undertaken after weeks or months, the
4243.44s: original observers cease to be a value
4246.00s: as far as additional new information is
4248.40s: concerned. Fair. Generally, late
4252.16s: interrogation yields only bare
4254.88s: repetition of facts originally reported
4257.84s: plus an inability on the part of the
4260.08s: observer to be objective. I agree with
4262.88s: that. I think the further, you know,
4264.40s: just like a magic trick, and I talk
4265.92s: about this um on several podcasts that
4268.64s: I've been on, but when describing
4273.84s: seeing or observing
4276.16s: anomalous phenomena, it is akin to
4278.48s: someone describing what a magic trick
4281.12s: was in that your perspective is a little
4285.12s: bit skewed because of, you know, the
4286.96s: impossibility, the nature of the
4288.32s: impossibility of the occurrence,
4291.76s: but also So immediately after an event
4295.44s: takes place, a few things happen to you
4299.92s: psychologically which inhibit you know
4304.24s: proper reporting
4306.24s: and one of those being you don't want to
4308.88s: seem foolish.
4311.04s: So you will make the conditions a little
4312.88s: bit more impossible. Uh, and two, a lot
4316.08s: of times you want to
4318.88s: make the person feel as though they were
4320.80s: there when explaining to them. So,
4323.12s: you're not trying to give them data,
4326.08s: you're trying to convey an emotion. And
4328.16s: you'll and when you do that, you pat on
4330.24s: things a little bit. You'll round off
4331.92s: the edges and erode the information a
4334.56s: little bit uh so that it appears more
4337.36s: digestible and more awe inspiring or
4340.32s: wondrous.
4341.84s: So, that will happen. So I understand
4343.44s: that existence of physical evidence,
4346.24s: photographs, material hardware. In cases
4348.24s: where any physical evidence exists,
4349.68s: follow-up should be made even if some of
4351.44s: the above criterion have not been met.
4356.16s: Right? So if you're reporting a
4357.36s: sighting, if you say, "Hey, I have a
4358.80s: piece of something," rest assured you're
4360.48s: going to get a knock on the door. And
4362.88s: conclusion, it is understood that all
4365.12s: the above criteria must be evaluated in
4367.20s: terms of common sense. The original
4368.88s: report from its working and clarity will
4371.60s: almost always suggest to the reader
4373.12s: whether there is any pay dirt in the
4375.84s: report.
4377.44s: Identification criteria.
4379.76s: When a UFO report meets in large measure
4382.24s: the criteria projected in section one
4384.48s: and a follow-up investigation is in
4386.80s: instituted, then the interrogator should
4389.44s: ask what physical object or object might
4392.32s: have served as the original stimulus for
4395.12s: the report. The word object here
4397.92s: includes optical phenomena such as
4399.60s: reflections from clouds, sun dogs, etc.
4402.40s: Frequently, one or perhaps two solutions
4405.36s: will be immediately suggested by the
4407.12s: nature of the report. The word solution
4410.24s: cannot be used here in the scientific
4412.16s: sense. A solution in UFO work means that
4415.28s: a hypothesis has been arrived at which
4418.72s: appears to have the greatest probability
4420.80s: of having given rise to the given
4422.80s: report. Following is a group of
4425.76s: hypotheses or examples which should
4428.00s: prove helpful in arriving at solutions.
4430.56s: A check should be made to see how many
4432.88s: of the items are satisfied by the report
4435.60s: and how many are missing. An effort
4438.08s: should be made to obtain any missing
4439.68s: items as soon as possible. Each typical
4442.56s: hypothesis is listed in a separate
4445.76s: paragraph.
4447.52s: So a lot of these things are going to be
4449.20s: reported, right? I remember I think it
4451.28s: was November or December a lot of people
4452.88s: had posted uh videos of the planet I
4456.40s: think it was Venus
4458.64s: and Venus in the wintertime before the
4461.92s: sun sets is completely visible in the
4465.60s: sky and brighter than any other star and
4468.64s: it just kind of sits there and so a lot
4470.40s: of UFO reports tend to increase during
4473.04s: that time. Not to say that UFOs don't
4475.84s: exist. We're just saying that people
4477.60s: will report prosaic uh events as well as
4482.24s: you know UFOs.
4484.32s: So something they have to be aware of.
4486.00s: So they talk about aircrafts, balloons,
4488.40s: meteors, stars or planets
4491.28s: um and optical phenomena including um
4495.20s: lights and sund dogs and whatnot. So I'm
4498.00s: not going to go through all of that.
4500.00s: That seems like a department for h you
4502.00s: know for Dr. Menzel uh to take care of.
4505.76s: But yeah, essentially just looking at
4508.40s: natural phenomenon and things that you
4510.56s: know, you would assume are up there. Uh,
4513.52s: another one of which that won't be
4515.92s: included in there now today, which makes
4518.00s: things, you know, exponentially more
4519.76s: complicated, satellites and drones and
4523.04s: experimental aircraft as well. But yeah,
4525.76s: that's something that we have to be on
4527.12s: the look for as well. So folks, that's
4529.84s: about it for the read through here. in
4533.20s: my opinion, a very thorough
4536.16s: manual of operations.
4539.04s: Everything from
4541.36s: what to do with the reported sightings,
4544.40s: what to do with the crash, how do you
4545.84s: lock down things, how do you create a
4547.44s: media blackout, how do you interrogate
4549.68s: and debrief people, where do you send
4551.84s: the wreckage, the bodies, the tech, the
4554.16s: live beings, who to contact, how to
4557.04s: package it, create it, ship it
4558.64s: nationally, internationally,
4560.88s: and just basically how to cover it up,
4563.44s: how to keep it secret. MJ12 to this day
4567.52s: continues to be a part of the UFO
4570.56s: Zeitgeist and lore. It includes everyone
4573.76s: from Bob Lazar
4576.16s: to Dan Burish or Crane to Richard Dodie
4580.96s: to all sorts of other people involved
4583.20s: and the campaigns of disinformation run
4586.64s: rampant within this area. So definitely
4590.32s: proceed with caution when consuming this
4592.32s: content, but keep an open mind as well.
4595.60s: I personally my conviction very very
4599.04s: high that MJ12 or at least the Majestic
4602.08s: program exists and most of that comes
4605.36s: from
4606.88s: you know confirmation
4608.88s: uh from Bob Lazar who I hold I think in
4612.72s: highest conviction of all people who
4615.12s: have stepped forward. crucify me for
4617.60s: that if you like, but uh I've spoken to
4620.24s: Bob, you know, on several occasions and
4623.76s: um it is clear to me at least that uh
4628.00s: that he was involved in one of these
4630.16s: projects and that the MJ stuff
4634.00s: is real. So, that is my personal
4637.44s: conviction level on the matter. And uh I
4640.40s: don't say that lightly, I'll tell you
4641.84s: that. Folks, let me know what you think
4644.16s: of the Majestic 12 group. If you haven't
4647.20s: already checked out the previous video I
4649.04s: made on these gatekeepers of aliens, go
4653.36s: check it out. I'll leave the link in the
4654.96s: description. I worked hard on that
4656.96s: video, too. And by all means, if you
4659.84s: want to check out Area52.shop
4662.16s: and shop your very own piece of MJ12
4666.56s: merch, by all means do so. It is there.
4670.08s: Uh we will not be reprinting anything.
4672.08s: This is like as soon as it's out there,
4673.44s: it's gone. It's gone and we're going to
4674.88s: move on. But this collection, um, you
4677.44s: know, we we stock the shelves quite a
4679.04s: bit. So, uh, have at it.
4683.44s: Um, join the Discord, check out the
4686.32s: extra episodes on the membership,
4689.92s: and yeah, we'll see you guys on the next
4692.00s: video. Next week, we got a cool guest
4693.76s: coming into the skiff. Uh, a Hollywood
4696.72s: director. Stay tuned for that.
4700.48s: Peace and love.
