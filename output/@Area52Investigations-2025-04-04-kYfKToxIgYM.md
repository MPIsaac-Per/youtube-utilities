0.08s: let's talk about the things that you've
1.88s: seen the three that I think are probably
3.72s: the most noteworthy on your podcast it's
6.32s: like this school bus shaped rectangle
10.32s: thing hovering like kind of right above
12.52s: the
14.00s: Treetops we were we were 5 minutes into
17.20s: our uh you know breath work and your
20.24s: hands can sometimes claim up and and his
22.84s: did and so we had to stop for a second
24.84s: and as soon as we stop we look up and we
26.96s: see two silvery orbs and one's hovering
31.36s: above him one's hovering above me and
33.80s: they're both sort of like
37.84s: bobbing third sighting is with uh Lou
40.76s: alzando so famous you know UFO
43.08s: whistleblower and uh so we're deep in in
45.48s: conversation on you know this sort of
46.92s: crazy science stuff and we just see over
49.80s: the shed we see a green Fireball just
53.64s: shoot shoot
55.44s: off do you believe David grush saw a
58.76s: craft uh no I don't I don't think he's
61.28s: seen a craft do you believe how put off
63.08s: seen a
64.52s: craft that's interesting maybe do you
67.80s: think that you've ever interviewed
70.68s: someone who you can confidently say has
73.64s: been inside a UFO in a government
76.68s: context do you think yes or no that
78.60s: you've spoken to someone who is possibly
80.60s: who has probably been in one of these
82.08s: crafts maybe okay yeah I just thought of
86.44s: somebody who maybe
88.24s: yeah I have a these really good friends
91.04s: Garrett Nicole mcnamer and their friend
94.76s: brought another friend who's a longtime
96.48s: kind of like Aerospace uh you know
98.64s: employee or whatever and uh he was at
101.28s: lunch and he looked a little sort of
102.80s: traumatized and they get into it and
104.80s: they find out that this guy had been uh
106.92s: an employee at Area 51 apparently he had
110.12s: been taken down again also underground
113.56s: so similar to the Oscar wolf story and
116.96s: seeing a reptilian being
120.16s: uh in custody like somehow like like
122.96s: like chained up and uh and that the
126.60s: thing seemed to speak to him like
128.60s: telepathically and he freaked
133.44s: out so I grew up in Southeast Georgia uh
137.24s: near a farm and we used to play
139.64s: nighttime flashlight tag hide and seek
142.96s: and I went out to hide while my cousin
147.20s: who moved a couple houses away was
148.60s: counting I experienced two very bright
151.28s: white flashes like someone put a camera
153.64s: off and I just stood there stunned for a
156.28s: moment and I noticed on the other side
158.88s: of the farm there were cop cars driving
160.80s: by with flashlights looking for
162.60s: something and I stopped and wondered
164.00s: what's going on and I then I heard from
166.56s: the back porch of our house behind me my
168.60s: mother calling my name frantically
171.36s: calling for me and she saw me and ran
174.80s: towards me and hugged me and said where
177.04s: have you been what's been going on I
178.96s: said we were just playing
180.40s: flashlight tag she said look at what
182.56s: time it is she said it's past 10:00 when
185.00s: this happened it was probably around
186.76s: 8:30 or so this happened to me and I
188.96s: don't know what that was
190.56s: about all right ladies and gentlemen
193.04s: today I am joined by today's American
198.24s: Alchemist is the American Alchemist
201.48s: himself Jesse Michaels welcome man Chris
204.52s: thank you so much for having me yeah
206.56s: absolutely uh this has for me been
209.84s: really uh I I've been looking forward to
211.72s: this podcast for a long time um but
215.08s: we've been hanging out quite a bit too
217.00s: and chatting and working on different
218.96s: projects and Consulting each other on
221.24s: different things for a little while now
224.44s: and you know I've I've gotten my hangs
226.60s: in with you which is so cool absolutely
229.52s: uh but now this is it's it's almost
231.40s: weird because I feel like like we're
234.08s: clearly friends off the podcast but this
236.68s: is more for like for people out there
239.32s: because like it or not people watch our
240.76s: videos and they're like I get it all the
242.20s: time dude you should have Jesse in the
244.32s: skiff you know well well I'm honored man
247.12s: and uh I I'm grateful to just know you
250.64s: as a friend and uh you you've been so
252.88s: awesome to me and uh this set is so cool
256.12s: to see in real life it's kind of surreal
258.72s: because I've been watching it so much
260.72s: digitally yeah and uh yeah man I love
263.32s: our uh our weird phone calls that always
265.36s: last like two hours longer than they're
267.96s: supposed to we go go down these crazy
270.68s: rabbit holes so uh yeah I'm grateful for
272.68s: you man and I'm I'm happy to be here
274.64s: thanks man and I'm Not The American
275.92s: Alchemist my guests are but thank you
278.24s: yeah well today you are Area 52 or today
282.84s: yeah okay um yeah dude you've been
286.76s: probably the most inspirational person
288.44s: in this space uh for creators like
291.16s: myself but also for people who are
293.68s: looking to create and talk about this
295.52s: stuff and for people who are just
297.64s: looking for a good story and as you know
300.96s: like a lot of my channel is based on
302.44s: story and and I love telling a good
304.96s: story and I love when people come on
306.04s: here and tell great stories but you have
308.20s: this amazing ability to draw good
311.20s: stories out of people and even more
313.72s: amazing I think and this is something I
315.48s: I I'm you know probably be echoed on by
318.16s: the audience but you have some type of
322.80s: ability of getting people on camera to
327.48s: talk it's really incredible
330.24s: for sure well thank you yeah have you
332.04s: ever thought about the list of people
334.52s: that have like been on your show and
336.28s: like how expansive that is in terms of
339.04s: knowledge yeah it's pretty crazy you
341.80s: know sometimes I pinch myself and I'm
343.68s: like oh wow like I met all these amazing
345.68s: people and I've got I've been able to
347.24s: speak to them and I I think there's
349.36s: something about that's kind of maybe
351.04s: disarming like I'm I I I you get what
354.16s: you see I think with me and I'm I'm very
356.56s: I think I I'm pretty chill um you know
359.28s: on the inside I think I'm a little more
360.68s: intense but at least I come off you know
363.32s: adaptively as chill or something and and
365.52s: uh yeah I don't know I feel I feel
367.40s: really grateful and lucky and I think I
369.52s: I'm good at like you for example you put
374.16s: so much thought into everything you do
376.24s: and I can see that just spending time
377.60s: with you you know today and yesterday
379.76s: but also from all of our interactions
382.08s: the production here is just next level
384.92s: and the way you talk about magic you go
387.12s: so deep into magic and you build like uh
390.04s: Foundation where other people kind of
391.92s: take shortcuts and the merch you sell
394.56s: and like the fact that you have interns
396.08s: on your Discord like everything is so
397.88s: well thought out so like I uh see other
401.32s: people I think for who they are and I
402.88s: appreciate the best aspects of them and
405.48s: I think uh that's uh that helps me uh
409.04s: because uh they they know I'm not you
410.76s: know playing some weird game of gotcha
412.56s: and uh you know I kind of understand
414.16s: where they're coming from and and I kind
416.04s: of you know feel them out yeah that's so
418.44s: important that is so important because
421.92s: that's there's two ways of getting
424.28s: to an answer that's interesting from
426.92s: someone and one is the gacha like you
429.48s: mentioned right and I feel like that's
431.24s: the easy route right right right because
433.92s: anybody can formulate a tricky question
436.24s: yeah but to have somebody comfortable
439.72s: enough for them to open up and talk
441.60s: about things that you didn't even know
443.60s: were in there yeah you know I think that
445.84s: takes um it takes more it takes it takes
448.28s: a comfort level that clearly you Foster
451.96s: during these interviews and I think
453.92s: that's part of why people watch your
456.04s: videos we you know you learn through
459.72s: watching those what good conversation
462.96s: looks like and that's not a tutorial you
465.48s: could normally just go and Google you
467.40s: know well that's so nice of you to say
469.56s: I'm horrible with
471.04s: compliments but I really appreciate that
473.40s: man means a lot um yeah no for sure I
477.68s: think it's uh it's just appreciating the
480.32s: E the essence of you know what what
482.04s: makes that person special and some
483.48s: sometimes especially in this space as
484.76s: you know people have a lot of issues and
488.84s: uh you know uh I don't know you you have
491.44s: to kind of glean out the you're
493.60s: sometimes you're panning for gold yeah
495.16s: you know and it's like a lot of what the
497.88s: person has to say doesn't feel accurate
502.56s: you know in their case I think sometimes
505.00s: like it it maybe it's self-deception so
507.04s: like they think they're like you know
508.40s: 100% truthful but there's there aspects
510.84s: of the story that feel just off and I
513.40s: think you can um emphasize the parts
516.88s: that are of use to the outside world and
520.12s: then sometimes rhetorically even get at
522.64s: you know the parts that don't make sense
524.20s: or whatever and you can do that through
526.56s: just friendly interaction and you don't
528.56s: have to be combative and you don't have
530.08s: to actually have them kind of hate you
531.84s: forever and then that also gets you
533.76s: closer to the truth and then they they
535.72s: probably feel a little less guilty or
537.36s: better or whatever CU they know that was
538.76s: like a more honest interaction you know
541.04s: than they maybe generally have or
542.64s: whatever yeah it's not stirring in their
544.60s: brain at night like they're they feel
546.04s: good about that conversation yeah
548.04s: totally yeah it's a good point um you
551.64s: know especially like you said in this
552.88s: topic this can be a very divisive topic
555.64s: and sort of um polarizing to speak about
560.00s: uh not only not only uh Vis the audience
564.44s: but also with the guest him or herself
567.84s: um the different on I ologies that
570.00s: people hold dear to them you know uh is
573.40s: is is a tricky place to navigate yeah I
575.84s: think yeah I think VI violence occurs
578.60s: next to the sacred or next to the truth
581.04s: and so you think of Science and you
583.00s: could couch UFOs within science because
584.80s: it's like empirical inquiry into the
586.36s: natural world as uh you know
589.08s: transcending uh politics it's transp
591.48s: poitical and in fact it's the most
593.24s: political it's the most I mean if you
595.12s: look at like the UFO world it's it's
596.60s: like just absurd like sort of infighting
599.44s: and it's because it's this like kind of
600.88s: religious dogmatic thing for a lot of
602.68s: the people kind of involved and uh I
605.48s: think it's unfortunate because I think
606.84s: you know it should just be this kind of
608.28s: personal Quest ultimately and it doesn't
610.36s: really matter what anybody else says
612.12s: like it doesn't at all and and and
613.96s: fixating on any of this stuff like I
616.08s: think the best and your show is amaz
618.08s: amazing at this too uh the best I think
621.60s: media in the space is simply expository
625.04s: it's just like you know trying to glean
627.28s: out you know the the the the most authen
629.32s: autic version of whatever the other
630.56s: person's trying to say and then
632.60s: partically you know trying to
634.88s: approximate truth over the course of
637.12s: many guess and I don't know if you feel
638.76s: like this but like maybe since since
640.84s: starting Area 52 do you feel like you're
643.20s: a little bit closer to some semblance of
646.56s: Truth and maybe it's a a Gestalt sense
648.96s: of Truth and it's not like a a file you
651.84s: could you know give somebody but do you
653.60s: feel kind of closer to to the reality of
657.76s: this subject or do you feel like it's uh
659.96s: just as confusing as when you started um
664.20s: definitely I wouldn't say just as
666.00s: confusing there's more I've more access
667.92s: to more information now uh which leads
670.64s: me to having sort of more Niche and
673.04s: deeper questions about the subject
675.00s: matter but all in all I do feel like the
677.92s: more that I lean into this the more that
680.84s: I realize that the answers are usually
682.72s: found within and and and that seems to
685.36s: be the overarching sort of theme of all
688.48s: of this like when you get to the end of
690.08s: nuts and bolts what are you left with
691.60s: you're left with Consciousness and
692.76s: you're left with you know and ESP what
695.36s: is that oh we go back to like this
696.84s: Quantum field oh we're all one and so it
699.04s: always comes back to that for me yes and
701.96s: I think in that in that regards I did I
704.16s: have learned a lot because it has set me
705.76s: down some like paths where I've you know
708.12s: had some self-discovery and for that I'm
710.60s: thankful but in terms of am I do I feel
713.04s: like I'm closer to you know maybe the
715.68s: nuts and bolts
717.96s: side hard hard to say hard to say it
720.72s: feels like it but that might just be an
722.28s: illusion sure because I have more
724.00s: information but and yet I've still not
725.92s: seen a UFO in front of me with aliens
728.92s: right so but somehow I feel closer but
731.44s: yeah I don't know well I I think often
734.28s: the uh kind of little known dirty dirty
737.68s: little secret of this space is like most
740.64s: of the people in it have kind of
742.96s: autobiographical reasons for being in it
745.52s: and one of my favorite quotes is from
748.44s: the uh no dialogues in Plato and it's a
750.84s: all knowledge is recollection and it
753.12s: it's it actually involves I think it's
754.92s: like socr Socrates and fadis and they're
757.84s: like they're showing that like a slave
760.64s: at the time because this is ancient
761.84s: Greece knows how to like draw a triangle
764.72s: and it's purely primordial knowledge
767.04s: because uh you know he's gotten no kind
769.40s: of formal tutoring or whatever and
771.28s: there's something about this space
772.64s: because you are uh nobody has the formal
776.28s: education it's so confusing yeah and um
779.28s: so there's no kind of you know formal
781.48s: credentialed pathway that you can
783.04s: there's no curriculum right that you
785.32s: really have to like trust your kind of
787.04s: internal barometer and you have to trust
788.76s: your instincts and that's like that's a
790.24s: very important sensor and I think the
792.48s: way you make the sensor better is
793.80s: actually then by distrusting your
795.28s: instincts it's this like constant kind
797.24s: of recursive Loop of also being like I
799.04s: could be entirely wrong and down the
800.68s: wrong path yeah um but it's a I think it
804.48s: that kind of uh uh mental gymnastic
807.04s: process is is is healthy for anybody to
809.68s: engage in yeah definitely healthy but
811.72s: definitely also tricky if you're not
813.88s: prepared for it because it could send
815.12s: you down some you know dark Pathways for
817.28s: sure you know I often think that like
818.80s: this because this whole subject matter
821.64s: is anomalous right in in in terms of
825.16s: what reality is this is an outlier it's
827.24s: an anomaly that we're studying right
829.32s: just kind of like if you were doing a
830.76s: science experiment and an anomaly
833.32s: occurred uh I mean there's two options
835.60s: there you can study the anomaly or
837.96s: ignore the anomaly call it an anomaly
840.24s: because it doesn't fit the model and
841.48s: move on and we because we choose to
844.76s: focus on the anomaly yeah uh innately
848.16s: cannot dismiss any other anomaly yeah
850.72s: and so we're forced to intake these
853.76s: sometimes ludicrous realities and and
856.96s: actually try and make them fit somehow
859.80s: and sometimes we get a piece from them
861.28s: that fits and the other part's just
862.84s: completely insane you know I've I've
865.56s: heard stories of Dan bares mhm and that
868.76s: I was like what are you talking about D
871.16s: jrod yep and then I get Danny Sheen and
874.96s: he's like well there's Al on S4 and
876.80s: answering questions and I'm like God do
878.40s: I have to go watch jrod again do I have
880.04s: to I guess you know and does that open
882.12s: the door for Bob again and like you know
883.76s: like there's all these so we have to
885.72s: study these anomalies to totally and it
888.44s: it can kind of drive you a little nutty
890.84s: sometimes a little nutty with Dan BR is
892.84s: a great example because we were with
895.32s: your good friend my new friend Luigi
897.80s: last night he's making this amazing
899.12s: project gravitar and like you have to
901.00s: think right like he has all this amazing
902.56s: evidence that the Bazar stuff you know
904.60s: he's probably at Area 51 at S4 and so
909.20s: that the Dan Bish story involves S4
912.68s: involves Area 51 he gets recruited by
915.16s: Edward Teller to study at Stonybrook you
917.24s: know he's this like microscopy expert at
919.36s: UNLV or whatever and so it has the exact
922.64s: same pattern as the Lazar story and so I
926.16s: I I I think it's an epistemological
929.76s: uh Paradigm Shift studying this stuff
932.36s: it's not just a scientific paradigm
933.88s: shift and the reason I say that is
935.20s: because if you look at Francis Bacon and
937.68s: like the Advent of science itself it
939.96s: always involves a prioritize skepticism
942.04s: you have to go into an experiment with
944.40s: the null hypothesis and the the null
946.08s: hypothesis is that the experiment is
947.96s: going to show nothing that it's wrong
949.32s: that the reality as we know it is
951.48s: correct and uh with this topic and I
955.24s: think actually probably healthier
956.56s: thinking points more towards like uh
958.52s: beian thought or reasoning which uh
961.16s: Danny shean is an expert at and always
963.00s: likes to talk about he talks about you
964.16s: know Thomas Bay is this English
966.12s: statistician from the 18th century and
968.20s: that's more like no be open to
970.96s: everything be open to everything and
974.12s: don't discount wholesale discount
976.40s: anything and catalog everything is
978.88s: extremely low probability and then uh
981.36s: build corroboration as you see you know
984.24s: okay Bob Lazard I don't know I'm not so
985.84s: sure Dan Bish wow it's p pattern matches
988.32s: the same way oh Danny Shan's telling the
989.80s: story and he's broken all these other
992.00s: incredibly important American
993.32s: conspiracies okay you know maybe there's
995.56s: something here so um I think that's
997.96s: actually a healthier way of of of
999.56s: thinking but it's it's not really you
1001.56s: you say it's scientific but it's not the
1003.24s: way most scientists yeah than it takes
1006.04s: patience takes a ton of patience yeah
1008.32s: most people get re really frustrated in
1009.96s: this space when they don't have the
1011.32s: answer they're seeking in the amount of
1013.28s: time that they've been seeking it yeah
1015.56s: whether that's 30 40 years or whether
1017.20s: that's one year whatever it is like you
1018.96s: sense people's frustration with you know
1021.36s: trust me bro and all this stuff and the
1023.80s: way that I see it is that like it's all
1025.48s: interesting yeah yeah true or not it
1028.56s: makes for an interesting story it's fun
1030.84s: to find those puzzle pieces and sort of
1033.24s: you know connect them together and be
1034.96s: like oh that kind of fits if you I guess
1037.00s: if you force it a little bit it kind of
1038.36s: fits in this puzzle you go oh it kind of
1039.88s: looks like something now and like you
1041.52s: know that's that's a that's a fun
1043.16s: exercise to do and I like I agree I
1045.00s: think it is healthy but it's hard it's
1047.12s: hard but I also think it leads to and
1049.24s: I've said probably said this ad nauseum
1050.80s: on other podcasts but it leads to
1052.56s: breakthroughs anomalies always lead to
1054.36s: the next like like the next Theory
1057.32s: better encapsulates the anomaly than the
1059.72s: current theory whether it's black body
1061.48s: radiation before the quantum Revolution
1063.96s: or you know the the uh orbit of mercury
1066.88s: like you have so many cases where like
1068.80s: you have an effect you can't turn the
1071.48s: effect into math and you can't make it
1073.36s: repeatable it does not mean the effect
1075.56s: doesn't exist you could say it doesn't
1077.48s: exist an anomaly it's an Aly and that's
1079.36s: what a UFO is and so I'm so excited
1082.24s: because I think if you actually like the
1084.44s: more historically predictable thing to
1086.92s: say is that we are probably going to
1089.00s: have some working theory of what UFOs
1092.00s: involve in the future and so it's just
1094.52s: epic to try to be at the Forefront of
1096.52s: that yeah definitely and and it's
1098.36s: exciting to think which theory that will
1100.88s: end up being yes or you know will it be
1103.44s: a brand new Theory or a maybe a mashup
1107.20s: of all of them like who knows and just
1109.40s: while maintaining humility that theories
1112.68s: are the maps and there's some underlying
1114.76s: territory and the map is never the
1116.08s: territory yeah so the theory is never
1117.88s: going to be the end of history and if
1120.04s: you think about it like since leits and
1122.20s: Newton you know over the last you know
1124.20s: 400 years the way we've uh modeled our
1128.20s: reality is Vector calculus and so like
1131.52s: like everything has to if you if it's
1133.04s: not turned into vector vector calculus
1134.92s: it's not real you know parapsychology is
1136.92s: not real UFOs are not real all these are
1139.04s: not real and then like you know you have
1141.12s: a few drinks with like a you know an
1143.08s: academic and they're like ah well
1144.40s: there's actually like a lot of data
1145.68s: around that we just don't really know
1147.16s: how to like make it repeatable or turn
1148.44s: it into math and so um that's because of
1153.08s: these a priori heuristics that we have
1155.96s: around Vector calculus or whatever and
1157.80s: may maybe in the future it's like you
1159.52s: know you have these Wolfram guys where
1161.20s: it's like a computational understanding
1163.20s: of the universe or maybe it's like Plato
1165.56s: comes back and it's like we're in the
1167.08s: cave and who knows but but they're all
1169.56s: just mental models mhm and it's really
1172.00s: hard it's the it's the problem of the
1173.20s: eye seeing the eye like it's very hard
1175.08s: to you can't really audit your own
1177.40s: measurement sensor you know right it's
1179.92s: like it's ultimately this like kind of
1181.88s: epistemic impass yeah yeah I almost I
1184.56s: almost like to think that it might be uh
1187.16s: something that Douglas Adams would dream
1189.00s: up and it's just like the Dolphins or
1191.68s: the most intelligent species in the
1193.12s: universe or the second most and they
1194.80s: just leave the planet thanks for all the
1196.24s: fish right you know some some silly you
1198.88s: know thing because at the end of the day
1201.16s: I mean even this whole subject matter is
1203.68s: kind of silly I say that a lot I'm like
1205.56s: this is a silly look at look where we're
1208.44s: sitting we're in a skip this is silly
1210.88s: and insane we're playing we're kind of
1212.80s: playing dress up right now but talking
1214.76s: about you know some of the most
1215.64s: important things in in human history but
1218.12s: also at the same time I think levity
1220.48s: sort of adds um I don't know it just it
1223.36s: just makes it makes it palatable totally
1225.92s: you know because you can't spend your
1227.24s: days in a dark basement surrounded by
1229.60s: files and not come out of it um you know
1232.20s: a normal
1234.52s: person you have to you have to be able
1236.76s: to to add levity to to laugh a little
1239.16s: bit at what we're doing and to you know
1241.20s: find interesting things and definitely
1243.08s: be like the hard-nosed you know I need
1244.96s: to figure this out and all this but at
1247.04s: the end of the day I kind of throw it up
1248.04s: in the air and be like yeah but what if
1249.20s: it's also I don't know you know tall
1251.48s: Bean looking people who cares it's fun
1254.52s: and and not be overly zealous like you
1257.16s: and Luigi updated a lot of I kind of
1259.36s: thought that the bobazar stuff well I
1261.84s: still think it might be somewhat of a
1263.36s: limited hangout and pushed by the CIA or
1265.48s: whatever but I was unsure that he even
1268.92s: worked at Area 51 yeah and now I'm
1271.36s: pretty sure he did because of you and
1273.04s: Luigi and at that point it's like the
1276.00s: most interesting thing in the world okay
1277.40s: so what did he see and like how how much
1279.16s: of what he saw was true and how much of
1280.80s: what he worked on was true and so I
1283.40s: think it requires like like you know
1286.32s: first meeting you I'm like this guy's a
1288.24s: magic like what is he going to teach me
1290.04s: about he taught me a whole lot and you
1293.48s: honestly even in this trip like you know
1295.80s: so much and it's a different Vector of
1298.28s: knowledge often than like what I'm
1299.96s: interested in on like sort of the more
1301.32s: science n nuts and bolt side or whatever
1303.72s: and it's so cool um so yeah I think I
1307.12s: think it also requires just a lot of
1308.88s: humility and uh kind of a a team effort
1312.68s: Vibe as well yeah definitely yeah and
1315.52s: and especially I mean while we're while
1317.80s: we're talking about Bob as well I think
1319.96s: one of the most important factors and
1321.64s: I've said this you know when I made the
1324.20s: sort of um interview with Luigi about
1326.80s: craitor I'd said this too but knowing
1329.96s: Bob and I I don't feel like I know him
1331.84s: at all um but I feel like I've seen
1334.24s: sides of him that people haven't seen
1335.68s: because of the videos that I was shown
1336.84s: and the conversations that I've actually
1337.92s: had with Bob um character for me is an
1342.80s: important thing and I'm like yourself I
1346.72s: think a pretty good judge of it when it
1348.64s: comes to you know [ __ ] meter and I'm
1350.80s: sure a lot of people say that and I know
1352.04s: a lot of people say that I think you're
1353.96s: an extremely good judge of it and I
1355.92s: think it comes from their magic
1357.36s: background as well potentially yeah and
1360.08s: I think that that um there are certain
1363.60s: they're just there's certain people who
1365.76s: who you can look in the eye and you know
1369.16s: they can tell you something and you
1371.76s: go you know like I don't know like
1374.20s: there's I I've had people sat across
1375.88s: from me that I don't believe everything
1377.36s: they've said you know
1379.04s: andge them andine um but Bob I don't
1383.24s: know I don't I don't get that I don't I
1385.88s: don't get that at all I think I think
1387.56s: he's just saying his truth that's what
1389.36s: it seems like and now this this raises
1391.68s: the question of is his truth tampered
1395.36s: with right exactly right and and the
1398.48s: beauty of Bob is that he will say that's
1401.84s: possible exactly you know and and that's
1404.60s: why I'm like that's one of the this is
1406.04s: one of the most important cases I think
1408.20s: in in all of euphology because point me
1410.84s: to another experiencer or another
1414.20s: whistleblower who doesn't have their own
1417.60s: opinion y about what they think is going
1419.84s: on y or who doesn't you know expound
1423.32s: upon rumors or sit there and try to
1426.80s: think of like some scenarios like oh
1429.00s: yeah well maybe they're doing this or
1430.48s: maybe they're from this planet or like
1432.48s: he there's none of that there's never
1434.24s: speculation with this guy and and it's
1436.36s: um you know Jen heinik uh you know
1439.72s: legendary astronomer uh leader of Blue
1442.08s: Book he had his you know different
1443.80s: ranking you know Close Encounters of the
1445.36s: first second and third Kind Third Kind
1446.92s: being most famous where it's like you're
1448.28s: interacting with the being itself you
1450.48s: could say Bob oar's a close encounter of
1452.76s: The Fourth Kind because the Third Kind
1454.96s: is obviously fascinating it's kind of
1457.00s: very in-your-face but it's very
1458.32s: ephemeral and it's usually retrieved
1460.32s: through hypnotic regression or at best
1461.88s: you have these shards of memories
1463.32s: because it so the person interacts with
1465.32s: the experience just like uh anybody
1467.56s: would exper would experience anything
1469.00s: traumatic where it's sort of you know
1470.64s: slightly broken um and in this case the
1473.44s: guy is talking about a discrete location
1476.00s: working on a craft that might still be
1478.20s: at that location or you know might have
1480.52s: been moved somewhere and maybe we could
1481.88s: figure out where that is and we have
1483.84s: technology that we can repeatably use um
1487.04s: and so like that that's like and he's
1489.12s: alive the witness and so yeah I agree
1491.60s: it's in a category of its own and it's
1493.88s: I'm so pumped about uh what Luigi's
1496.56s: doing I hope you get to do stuff with
1499.00s: Bob and uh yeah I'm excited to see how
1502.16s: that uh kind of wave function collapses
1504.44s: so to speak sure exactly same here same
1507.84s: here but now um I want to I want to
1509.52s: transition over into I want to
1511.76s: transition over into some experiences
1513.80s: that you've had okay um you I told you
1516.16s: before the podcast like do you mind have
1517.40s: asked you about these you know these
1519.12s: these experience you had you were
1520.12s: totally fine with it um so this isn't
1522.48s: like a go a moment tell me about the
1525.16s: UFOs Jesse where are they hiding them um
1529.12s: you had multiple experiences you've been
1531.48s: open with them but I kind of want to
1532.88s: catalog them here for you know someone
1535.08s: who doesn't have to watch you know all
1537.28s: the little pieces and F together let's
1538.84s: talk about the things that you've seen
1541.04s: yeah yeah so I think three I seen a
1544.80s: decent number of UFOs honestly and it it
1547.52s: might be something where because I'm
1548.92s: interested in the topic like I'm you
1551.08s: know more aware or something I I I don't
1553.52s: know I can't it's sort of hard to
1554.84s: explain but the three that I think are
1557.08s: probably the most noteworthy on your
1559.04s: podcast um number one was I had just
1562.24s: moved to Laurel Canyon and so Laurel
1564.80s: Canyon's actually kind of a Trippy Place
1566.56s: unto itself I don't know if you're
1567.72s: familiar with the history but it has an
1569.60s: amazing music history so um you know the
1572.92s: masas and the Papas uh were there uh
1576.24s: Jimmy Hendrick I think lived there uh
1578.64s: Crosby Stills Nash The Who's Who of like
1581.40s: 60s 7s era you know classic rock um and
1584.80s: it just has that Vibe of like like the
1587.52s: muses are around or something um and you
1591.08s: know all these kind of Bohemian like
1592.76s: interesting architecture and it it's
1594.88s: it's great I love it and I I had just
1597.24s: moved there and and the pandemic had
1599.24s: just hit there was something very trippy
1600.68s: about the pandemic as well where like
1602.76s: you're at home and you know you all of a
1606.48s: sudden you find yourself with like not
1607.92s: that at least I did I found myself with
1610.28s: not as you know more time on my hands
1611.92s: not as much to do and you start to think
1613.60s: about like more interesting ontological
1616.40s: questions and so um I was uh uh with a a
1621.52s: woman who I was kind of starting to see
1623.36s: at the time and um she actually lived in
1625.56s: Laurel Canyon as well and uh we were
1628.08s: going on a walk and uh this was like I
1631.24s: don't know like an hour into the walk or
1633.00s: something uh aliens come up and uh she
1636.52s: was like you know do you believe in
1637.88s: aliens I was like yeah actually I'm kind
1639.64s: of I'm kind of into aliens like the like
1642.28s: an interest of mine at the time it was a
1645.32s: it was a pretty serious interest of mine
1647.24s: but not as deep as I'd say now okay
1650.20s: previous to any YouTube okay previous to
1652.88s: any YouTube so I was investing uh out of
1655.44s: Peter Teal's family office that was that
1657.16s: was my job and uh you know I had a a
1660.80s: serious interest in the UFO thing but
1662.76s: like yeah I never thought it would like
1664.60s: turn into like you know me like
1666.44s: interviewing a ton of people about it or
1668.44s: anything like that and uh we're walking
1670.92s: and I'm like yeah you know I'm kind of
1672.36s: end aliens and then and then I say half
1674.76s: jokingly I go I'd love to meet an alien
1677.52s: and then she goes uh it'll happen when
1680.04s: you stop looking for it and as she says
1683.40s: that we're walking by a guy who has a
1685.32s: metal detector and this is like sunset
1687.80s: in Laurel Canyon and he's like looking
1689.76s: for something so it's like this bizarre
1692.20s: uh um externalization of our
1695.00s: conversations you know happening in
1696.80s: reality like it doesn't make any sense
1699.56s: um and this could be survivorship bias
1701.52s: of like me remembering that because
1703.28s: that's what we said at the time I don't
1704.56s: know but it it notably weird right and
1707.56s: we walk by by this guy and a few moments
1710.80s: you know you know pass and we we hit
1713.72s: this little clearing this is on on
1715.76s: Lookout Mountain in in Laurel Canyon for
1717.88s: anybody that knows Laurel Canyon and
1719.40s: there's a little clearing and it's like
1722.24s: this school bus shaped rectangle thing
1727.04s: uh long like like long like this and
1730.08s: it's and it's just hovering like kind of
1732.16s: right above the Treetops like maybe 50
1734.88s: fetish and just it just goes right over
1738.12s: the Treetops how far away from you like
1740.60s: 50 fetsh or 60 feet or something like
1743.36s: not that high at all any features any
1747.40s: notable features on this
1749.04s: craft so like I'm I'm afraid that like
1753.16s: I'll I'll botch the description of it
1756.56s: try
1758.32s: like I want to say like like like a like
1761.32s: it looked like a flying car that's how
1764.16s: weird it shape of a car uh shape well
1767.40s: more like a school bus because it was so
1768.92s: long it rectangular it was rect it was
1770.60s: rectangular like tapered at the ends it
1772.60s: was not tapered at the ends no uh
1775.48s: honestly it was so weird because it
1777.16s: didn't look at all like what a flying
1779.28s: saucer would you know or like you know
1782.00s: any anything that I'd ever you saw it
1783.84s: from underneath then yes was the
1785.76s: underside a different color than the
1787.80s: sides of it no it all kind of like this
1790.28s: metallic gray and it did look like there
1792.32s: were like components underneath it um
1795.72s: but they didn't to me it wasn't clear
1797.88s: like like what purpose you w looking at
1799.52s: a muffler or an exhaust or anything like
1801.64s: that no no and there it was like there
1805.32s: was some sound but it almost felt like a
1807.24s: humming thing like it it didn't seem
1808.96s: like this uh like definitely not worthy
1812.52s: of like the exhaust necessary in a
1814.52s: chemical combust combustion context to
1816.84s: like keep that amount of mass in in the
1819.16s: sky um and then she said so then it like
1823.16s: floats over the treetop and we're both
1824.96s: just like what the [ __ ] is that and I
1827.20s: actually just actually um dm'd her on
1829.72s: Instagram and sent her a a video cuz it
1832.80s: was this was what I'll send I'll I'll
1834.52s: I'll I'll play this for you after um the
1836.44s: show or maybe you can even play it
1838.04s: something um because it was like the
1839.88s: closest thing to what I had seen okay
1842.60s: and I don't know if this video is fake
1844.28s: or real or what it is but it look and
1845.92s: she she responded being like yeah that
1847.96s: looks exactly like what we saw cool so
1850.36s: you know but I yeah and then she said
1853.44s: kept going and then it vertically
1855.76s: descended uh like you know some ways off
1858.84s: and I didn't see that into into the
1860.68s: Treet into the treetop so into the
1862.48s: forest was this like a wooded area yeah
1864.52s: L extremely wooded and so yeah into no
1867.12s: houses or businesses or anything like
1869.12s: that no that's a weird thing it's like
1870.12s: very residential there are houses so I
1871.92s: don't know what that means as far as
1873.48s: where it landed or broad daylight no it
1876.76s: was night it was night yeah was it was
1879.00s: it it was sunsh like a little after
1881.24s: Sunset okay so you clearly it was dark
1884.24s: though
1885.36s: yeah do you have any regrets not pulling
1887.96s: your phone
1889.64s: out the I'll tell you about the other
1892.16s: couple of times i' I've seen UFOs and I
1894.20s: didn't in those cases either and and and
1896.16s: in actually the next case uh that was
1899.12s: like the most like long like long
1901.20s: duration and whenever I I've seen a UFO
1904.64s: I I never I always feel like this is
1906.20s: kind of sacred and I don't know I don't
1908.24s: even feel like I should it feels like
1910.32s: sacrilegious and I know that sounds
1911.92s: insane it's just so funny cuz like I bet
1913.64s: the aliens are like what is he waiting
1914.88s: for get your phone out you wanted to see
1916.48s: us let's go what are you doing that's
1919.12s: true yeah okay can you walk us through I
1924.92s: I want to sit on this one for a second
1927.48s: because I'm trying to imagine myself and
1929.72s: I'm sure the audience is the same right
1930.96s: now we're trying to imagine ourselves
1932.04s: like what would you do you walking in
1934.28s: the woods with somebody you you kind of
1936.32s: just started to get to know and you see
1938.96s: this thing does your heart skip do you
1942.24s: is there any part of you that is
1943.68s: frightened is this a calm interaction or
1946.56s: is this just you trying to make sense um
1950.68s: sort of prosaically of this object the
1953.08s: whole time I was super excited like it
1956.36s: it because I I'm I don't know I'm like a
1959.48s: like intense sort of Truth Seeker or
1961.44s: whatever and I especially initially in
1963.84s: the UFO thing you're like you look at
1966.44s: the whole subject and you're like this
1967.60s: is kind of quacky and insane and then
1970.24s: you you build this like probability
1971.96s: thing where you know even like I think
1973.32s: it's like Richard Dawkins you know the
1975.52s: the uh kind of the priest the high
1978.04s: priest of the Citadel that is like
1979.80s: modern scientific skepticism or whatever
1982.56s: like he has some quote and I'm
1983.92s: paraphrasing here where it's like the
1987.04s: probability something it's like the the
1989.12s: multiplication of like the probability
1991.24s: of something being true and the
1992.60s: implications of it being true is like
1995.76s: how much you should study the thing so I
1997.60s: think it's like 5% aliens you should be
1999.52s: spending a lot of time on Aliens cuz
2001.08s: like that's the implications are like
2003.16s: you know that that part of the equation
2005.20s: is so high so you know at time I was
2009.20s: really oscillating around like how you
2011.28s: know how serious is that this whole
2012.92s: world is so quacky and so every time
2016.16s: I've had a firsthand experience it's
2017.88s: it's just like wow this is a to me I
2020.72s: mean there's so many people that the
2022.60s: modern I think Paradigm is don't trust
2024.52s: your eyes it's like you need some sensor
2026.68s: data it's like the Galileo project you
2028.16s: know Avi lob at Harvard it's like you
2030.12s: need like some objective scientific
2032.08s: sensor I think your eyes are all you
2034.36s: have and like actually you know an
2036.80s: abstract scientific measurement going
2038.56s: through your eyes should you know not
2040.24s: necessarily be more trustworthy that
2042.00s: somebody else by the way is reporting to
2043.32s: you who has more credentials or
2044.84s: something but like you're supposed to
2046.36s: trust that more than like a thing you
2047.84s: saw that doesn't really make sense and
2049.80s: yeah you should be like you know wary of
2052.32s: like maybe somebody put a flare up or
2054.20s: like you know I went to this you went on
2056.12s: a cruise for like C5 or something yeah
2058.44s: you should be skeptical you know think
2060.40s: about all you're a magician you should
2062.60s: think about all the ways in which you
2063.84s: know that that could have been
2065.00s: orchestrated but um yeah I but we can
2068.04s: you know I can go down that road all day
2069.48s: with everything and I explained this to
2070.72s: you last night as a magician it's our
2073.20s: job to come up with a method to an
2075.44s: effect so if you give me an effect as a
2078.32s: magician I can give you a method it's
2081.24s: not that I go well I guess there's no
2083.48s: methods I guess it is an alien no I can
2085.64s: give you a method for every single
2087.20s: sighting ever in the context of a magic
2090.20s: trick absolutely using psychology and
2093.32s: you know memory techniques and all all
2095.00s: all types of things right so I would
2097.16s: never apply I would always do it in my
2099.72s: own head and be like okay but then I
2102.32s: would weigh that against oh was the
2105.40s: point of that what was the point of
2107.20s: lying to me about this right yeah um or
2109.84s: yeah so so I think you are right I think
2112.16s: there is like validity to someone's own
2114.68s: sighting and if not just for that
2117.40s: immediate
2118.76s: recognition but for how that might have
2121.04s: changed you yeah do you see that event
2125.00s: having anything to do with the journey
2126.48s: you're on today that's a great
2129.72s: question I think yeah that in
2132.60s: combination with the next sighting which
2134.96s: was like I don't know six months is
2137.68s: after that six to n months yeah so I was
2140.04s: in uh Silver Lake with a buddy who
2143.68s: actually invests with me uh and is you
2146.60s: know pretty prominent investor and
2148.00s: actually is a complete like materialist
2150.16s: atheist like doesn't believe in any of
2151.48s: this stuff and I did I was just starting
2154.32s: to like you know try to convince him
2157.24s: that like maybe there's a there there
2159.08s: but yeah very skeptical like is a
2161.24s: believer in like David Hume and gome
2163.16s: Chomsky and like you know kind of very
2165.08s: rash hyper rationalist Guy and um and so
2169.32s: he we we went surfing that day and we
2171.44s: were back at his place and it was a
2172.76s: weekend it was like Saturday or Sunday
2174.44s: and we are uh doing holotropic breath
2176.80s: work because I I I'd been into it at the
2178.56s: time and I think it's a really cool yeah
2180.76s: I don't know if you're familiar with I
2182.20s: know John Mack um you know was was
2184.48s: teaching that to a lot of the abductees
2186.04s: as well to get them to try and calm down
2187.84s: during these abductions so that they
2189.24s: could recall and yep you know yeah
2191.48s: exactly and it it's an amazing technique
2193.56s: it was developed by stanislav gra who's
2195.32s: this Hungarian uh I guess psychiatrist I
2198.36s: think and uh it involves like hyper
2200.76s: oxygenation so just like bre breathing a
2203.24s: lot and rapidly like you know almost
2205.44s: like hyper like intentional hyper ventil
2207.96s: ventilation or something and um you know
2211.20s: actually I think the goal is like an
2212.96s: hour in you're you know you out of body
2215.60s: you have like a DMT like an endogenous
2217.64s: tea release or something but we were we
2219.68s: were five minutes into our uh you know
2222.24s: breath work and your hands can sometimes
2225.36s: clim up and and his did and so we had to
2228.12s: stop for a second and as soon as we stop
2229.92s: we look up and we see two silvery orbs
2234.32s: and one's hovering above him one's
2236.28s: hovering above me and they're both sort
2238.48s: of like bobbing H just not they don't
2241.56s: look at all like you know a drone
2243.52s: they're way too high uh to to be drones
2245.84s: they're definitely not planes and uh he
2249.16s: then looks to me and or I I think I go
2251.80s: like what the f is that and he looks to
2254.52s: me and he goes um oh I think that might
2256.96s: be that secret locki dech or something
2259.96s: and then uh you know a second goes by he
2261.96s: looks back at me and he goes dude that
2264.00s: those are not from here and especially I
2267.16s: think with the holotropic thing you know
2269.36s: I think again a debunker would say
2272.28s: you're a little lightheaded sure yeah
2274.36s: don't don't don't trust your eyes
2275.44s: especially if you're in a you know an
2276.72s: altered state maybe it didn't take an
2278.20s: hour for you guys to get into an altered
2279.80s: state it took 5 minutes or whatever but
2282.08s: um I would say you know like the you
2284.96s: know that stuff probably widens the
2286.48s: doors of your perception and maybe you
2287.92s: are seeing a thing that exists in
2289.92s: fundamental reality but uh you know
2292.88s: actually um uh Rick strasman you know uh
2296.52s: wrote uh uh uh DMT The Spirit Molecule
2298.92s: he talks about DMT as like it's like
2301.04s: night vision it's like another sensor
2302.80s: modality and I'm not saying you know who
2305.16s: knows if DMT was released it probably
2307.04s: was not
2308.44s: um but I I think the two things that are
2310.68s: repeatable in the UFO world if you are
2312.60s: looking at this scientifically and
2313.96s: looking for repeatability I think it's
2316.48s: uh Consciousness and uh uh nuclear and
2320.00s: so I think to me that points towards us
2321.96s: being in sort of a low-level simulation
2324.44s: and I don't know what these UFOs are
2326.32s: maybe they're kind of you know Envoy V
2328.04s: noyman replic replicators and you see a
2330.16s: little node light up and it's around you
2332.08s: know some sort of conflict Allah the
2333.76s: three body problem or you know
2336.08s: somebody's experimenting with the
2337.44s: scientific thing that like that you know
2338.92s: they're were not quite ready for yet or
2340.68s: whatever each had your own um sort of
2344.60s: UFO that you were assigned to maybe and
2347.16s: and and you you raised some red flag and
2349.08s: they both came to see what was going on
2350.96s: well it was it was interesting that one
2352.64s: was kind of bobbing there were two and
2354.32s: they were kind of bobbing up and it's
2355.52s: hard to say whether was one was directly
2357.36s: above me how's your human doing I don't
2359.40s: know they're both kind of just laying
2360.52s: there out of breath right right right
2362.40s: right yeah I mean you get into all sorts
2364.12s: of thought experiments of like where
2365.60s: does thought come from and you know who
2368.84s: knows so after you're saying after that
2371.04s: event that was more convincing with that
2374.48s: sighting would you say than than the
2376.12s: previous
2377.36s: one more convincing that that was not
2380.48s: from here um maybe in so far as it was
2385.44s: because it maybe a little more cut and
2386.72s: dry with the the the holotropic breath
2388.64s: work stuff yeah but also I mean the
2390.72s: previous one you know you had said I
2394.32s: want to see an alien I want to meet an
2395.68s: alien yeah and then she said something
2397.84s: amazing which I think is the best advice
2400.56s: I agree with everything right you'll see
2401.88s: it when you stop looking yes um you know
2405.52s: for you to see it right after that
2407.20s: moment yeah I think has Merit too I
2410.12s: agree I agree and I think that again
2413.44s: that's often okay I've spoken with a a
2416.80s: prominent journalist who uh has went on
2420.64s: a very big podcast I I just don't want
2422.56s: to identify this guy with that but he
2425.12s: basically had like he told like
2428.00s: everybody knows who this guy is yeah I
2429.52s: know who you're talking about okay yeah
2430.80s: you probably yeah there you go you're
2432.12s: good um and like he told a UFO story and
2436.08s: he had to leave the details out of like
2438.80s: the fact that he went searching like he
2442.88s: kind of like had a question going into
2444.96s: the you know UFO experience and that the
2448.00s: UFO resolved his experience and so like
2451.44s: often there's there are little details
2453.16s: left out of UFO experiences that um the
2457.04s: person thinks will marginalize it and
2458.68s: they have to do with the fact that the
2460.00s: UFO thing is like extremely
2461.60s: synchronistic like it makes them sound
2463.24s: slightly skitso or something um and
2465.60s: they'll always leave that part out and
2467.76s: then if you think about the UFO is kind
2469.68s: of just one class of asynchronicity then
2473.12s: like your whole life is actually often
2474.92s: like that if you take notice if you take
2477.20s: note of the synchronicities and like
2479.40s: this is I think it's a very common thing
2480.84s: you know Carl Young wrote a book about
2482.20s: it and there are plenty of people who
2483.92s: are extremely receptive to these sorts
2486.72s: of things and so yeah it's unfortunate
2489.76s: with the UFO thing where we we because
2492.32s: it's looked at as this possibly you know
2494.48s: interesting propulsion breakthrough in
2496.72s: you know in science or whatever we have
2498.28s: to somehow discard those very real facts
2501.16s: around them yeah and and it's it's it's
2504.24s: much like if you look at Betty and
2505.44s: Barney Hill they kind of went through
2506.80s: the same thing with the testimony that
2509.00s: Betty had uh on one hand if you look at
2513.76s: the testimony that was given to the Air
2515.72s: Force it was very cut and dry nuts and
2518.36s: bolts here's the time here's the
2520.20s: elevation here's the rotation here's the
2522.08s: here's the lights the colors the speed
2524.52s: the you know the the the side all the
2527.24s: all the sort of like data points yep and
2530.88s: then over here it was you know it it
2534.76s: froze me and and there there's the
2536.88s: beings and I connected with them and
2538.68s: like all that was left out of the Air
2540.52s: Force thing right because I think um the
2544.28s: story is going to change based on who is
2547.44s: you're talking to and so if you're
2549.48s: definitely speaking to someone who you
2551.20s: think who you believe isn't ready for
2553.76s: such information then you're going to
2555.72s: Omit that Y and so in today's landscape
2559.72s: I think well conversations like these
2561.08s: are really healthy because it does allow
2562.56s: people and I read the comments a lot
2564.00s: where there's I'm sure you get them too
2566.40s: in messages of people like I've never
2568.24s: told anyone this yeah yeah yeah and they
2570.36s: suddenly feel like it's okay to open up
2572.44s: about their experience it's just so
2574.28s: beautiful uh but you're right in the
2576.52s: context of the scientific review uh
2579.56s: those things we feel the need to have to
2582.12s: Omit them even though there might be
2583.92s: actual science behind them they just
2586.16s: feel a little too far removed from like
2589.16s: the the conventional data totally well
2591.08s: what I would say is if there is an
2592.56s: Intelligence on the other side that
2595.08s: wants to be known but wants to be known
2597.48s: by the right uh nodes distribution nodes
2600.92s: on our side that you should actually be
2603.92s: extremely transparent and candid and
2606.16s: then just let the chips fall where they
2607.64s: may I'll give you an example like I
2609.92s: could have artificially come up with
2612.44s: descriptions around that school bus like
2614.40s: I I actually felt a little like insecure
2616.16s: I was like I don't really remember man
2618.20s: yeah you know but like it's I think
2620.96s: whatever that is the and I believe there
2623.16s: is a non-human intelligent I think they
2624.68s: could fully audit everything going on
2626.64s: inside of you and so you just have to be
2628.64s: ex extremely brutally honest there's in
2630.64s: the telepathy tapes one of my favorite
2632.20s: quotes I don't remember which kid says
2633.76s: this says you don't get my Powers if you
2636.40s: lie yeah John Paul wasn't it John Paul
2638.96s: maybe John that would make sense yeah
2640.64s: John Paul or was it the other uh is it
2643.92s: Houston H actually yeah and I I think
2647.48s: that's so beautiful and I I think it's
2649.08s: actually around the parapsychology stuff
2651.24s: too which points to this you know these
2653.28s: random event generator exper uh
2655.08s: experiments where you take this binary
2657.56s: computer it's tied to something that is
2660.04s: supposedly random in quantum mechanics
2662.36s: so radioactive isotope Decay or Photon
2664.88s: bouncing around a box you know whatever
2666.84s: and um a person can in a statistically
2669.48s: significant way uh uh skew the output
2672.48s: towards ones or zeros it's supposed to
2674.12s: be this perfect digital coin flip and it
2675.76s: it seems like the data kind of cuts
2677.12s: against that which points to us sort of
2679.16s: rendering our reality and if you talk to
2681.88s: people who are involved in these
2683.52s: experiments they often say the more
2685.36s: heart-c centered and honest I feel and
2687.44s: internally aligned I feel the more uh of
2691.20s: a skewing effect you can get and if you
2693.20s: if you extrapolate that outwards it's
2695.56s: really your like kind of mind matter
2697.36s: effect in reality itself like your
2699.16s: ability to uh progress through the world
2702.40s: that we're in um uh is is actually
2705.12s: dependent on your sort of internal
2707.12s: harmonization and your ability to you
2708.80s: know get through blocks yourself and
2710.28s: just be like fully you know yeah candid
2713.00s: you can take a practical example to that
2714.60s: too is like um is it easier to get
2717.16s: somewhere if you work together or work
2718.40s: against each other yeah you know it's a
2719.96s: very dumb down example but of course
2722.40s: cooperation and and and helping each
2724.84s: other out and looking out for each other
2726.60s: is going to yield a better result MH
2728.76s: right so if you if you translate that
2730.48s: into even like some some type of like
2733.04s: Quantum interface that you might have
2735.52s: well leading with the heart should yield
2737.96s: a better result than being combative or
2739.68s: skeptic or or whatever that is so
2742.08s: naturally I think it just it's like
2743.80s: going with the current instead of
2745.04s: against it totally I I agree you know
2747.48s: you look at a lot of um religious
2749.40s: pictures it always I always that's
2751.04s: always stood out to me too you see these
2752.60s: beaming Hearts it's always these hearts
2755.08s: with like this Golden Light around it
2756.80s: right these angels are just like
2758.48s: emanating this love it's always like
2760.36s: this sort of Care Bear energy of like
2762.80s: it's all love it's all good it's all
2764.36s: love and like love seems to be like that
2766.16s: heart-c centered emotion and it's always
2769.16s: coming from the sky it's always you know
2771.00s: what I mean and and so you know perhaps
2774.24s: that was their way of like trying to
2776.20s: communicate to us that hey that's the
2778.52s: key and if the more we look into this
2780.64s: the more we're seeing that you know
2782.72s: might might not be the only key but it
2784.20s: seems to be the one that is the easiest
2786.28s: to access and the one that that is the
2788.48s: most
2789.28s: productive yeah I think it really is and
2792.52s: uh you know we were just talking about
2793.68s: this book uh uh trans surfing reality
2796.68s: and uh I think his name is vladim Zeland
2800.32s: and um it's it's all about sort of you
2803.12s: know this is really interesting model of
2804.72s: like time travel and you have these
2806.08s: various lifelines and you interact with
2808.80s: these sort of energy systems called
2810.32s: pendulums which feed off of your energy
2813.44s: and you can't avoid the pendulums all
2815.20s: together but you have to like pick the
2816.36s: good pend
2817.36s: and the whole thing exists in its own
2819.96s: idiosyncratic world and it involves a
2821.84s: lot of kind of jargon it's very
2823.24s: interesting but like the fundamental
2825.20s: thing as far as being able to kind of
2827.28s: manifest what you want in life is being
2829.28s: heart- centered heart- centered and
2830.96s: operating from the heart and I think
2832.48s: that is very fundamental and very
2835.12s: important it's it's easier said than
2836.52s: done it's something you can't fake you
2838.24s: know it's kind of you can't talk about
2839.56s: it in the abstract and and then not do
2841.44s: it and and somehow achieve a result you
2843.36s: know it's it's it's yeah it is or it
2845.56s: isn't and there is still like this
2847.32s: objective there has to still be this
2848.96s: objective view of consensus reality on
2852.16s: some level of course um but it makes you
2854.68s: think like how you can affect it on a
2857.32s: macro scale if we all came together and
2859.24s: did something right because because you
2861.68s: can change a one into a zero and that
2864.04s: might over the long run end up getting
2866.96s: you that success you wanted or that
2869.88s: relationship or whatever that is in life
2872.12s: that little manifesting that you've been
2873.80s: sort of fine-tuning and getting to and
2875.64s: that might disappear but what does that
2877.28s: look like on a large scale yeah you know
2879.52s: like if we all got together and just
2881.04s: decided hey let's make one of these
2882.48s: things appear and then we just congen it
2885.00s: out of nothing and it just kind of
2886.40s: appears right like is that possible
2889.36s: considering the sort of micro scale that
2893.08s: we have now of turning these ones into
2894.84s: zeros what does that look like right
2896.52s: well you I mean this brings up all these
2898.52s: epistemological questions of what is
2900.08s: reality itself there's like a concept
2902.04s: you know called an egregor like a
2904.16s: consensus thought form and like is
2906.24s: everything consensus thought you just
2908.04s: make things happen and things are things
2910.16s: are only existing because all of us are
2911.92s: thinking about it and there's no way to
2913.48s: disprove that I do think in the case of
2915.36s: the random event generator thing it's
2917.40s: like you uh healing yourself and
2920.64s: manifesting what you want in your life
2922.48s: is contagious and so I think that should
2924.80s: be your kind of prime directive versus
2927.80s: trying to kind of get everybody together
2929.88s: and like summon a thing the the latter
2932.44s: feels like you know kind of a perversion
2934.32s: of what but what what does that look
2935.68s: like when we're all on the same page age
2937.28s: like what what do you think you know do
2938.84s: you often like think like what could we
2940.36s: achieve like if we did like if you could
2942.40s: have one person turn some ones into
2943.88s: zeros okay or like there's that famous
2946.48s: plant experiment where they had the
2947.72s: plant in the middle of the room or in
2948.76s: the corner of the room you Noti this one
2950.52s: and they shine they shine a light in the
2952.24s: room and basically the light would shine
2955.56s: uh it was in one corner and it was on a
2958.20s: random sort of generator where the light
2960.60s: would shine randomly into one of the
2962.00s: corners right and so it should be 25%
2965.08s: but when they introduced a plant in the
2966.44s: corner it went more towards the plant
2969.12s: like the plant needed to survive the
2970.96s: universe felt that and it wanted to
2972.64s: thrive that's fascinating and it changed
2975.04s: the randomness a little bit just changed
2977.40s: a few ones into zeros so that the plant
2979.20s: would have a better chance of surviving
2980.80s: that's so fascinating because we think
2982.12s: of helot tropy is you know a plant
2984.72s: growing towards the Sun but you don't
2986.24s: think about it as the you know the
2987.64s: opposite where this seemingly
2988.88s: unconscious digital thing yeah you know
2991.28s: not digital but you know whatever uh uh
2993.32s: you know light uh uh mechanical thing um
2997.12s: is is is actually attracted to the pl to
2999.00s: itself that's amazing that's really cool
3001.16s: yeah and it's more about like it makes
3002.40s: you question what's the fundamental law
3005.72s: there what is happening is it is it is
3007.88s: it is it the plant needing to survive or
3010.36s: is it the universe itself you know um
3013.72s: surviving through the plant and and
3015.76s: saying you know this is part of me and I
3017.96s: need that to grow well go yeah I mean I
3020.36s: I think we are we don't see reality I
3023.48s: think we render reality and so you have
3025.60s: like this guy Donald Hoff talking about
3027.40s: how we don't we don't see like you know
3029.00s: electromagnetic waves right like we'll
3030.88s: see like the RBG spectrum and we iconize
3034.04s: everything we see into like a table or
3036.20s: the microphone you know whatever and um
3039.96s: I think that could apply to everything
3043.36s: we see and and and if you actually look
3045.60s: at like the Roger Penrose you know you
3047.48s: know this this physicist who you know
3050.00s: worked on a bunch of stuff with Hawking
3051.68s: and black holes and then and then he
3053.04s: started getting into Consciousness and I
3054.96s: think he very interesting I don't know
3056.24s: if it's correct correct and I think way
3057.88s: too many people kind of assume
3060.04s: everything this this anesthesiologist
3061.96s: that works with him steuart hamov says
3063.84s: is like you know exactly how
3065.44s: Consciousness works I think it's way too
3067.20s: reductionist and physicalist so I'll
3069.28s: caveat it with that but I think as a
3070.64s: mental model it's very interesting as to
3072.60s: how Consciousness works and it's called
3074.16s: orchestrated objective reduction and it
3076.48s: answers the question of why do we not
3078.88s: see probabilistic reality so just as I
3081.68s: iconize the you know RBG you know
3084.24s: electromagnetic waves why do I not see
3086.20s: quantum probabilities why do I see Rel
3088.52s: relativistic macroscopic discreet
3090.56s: reality I just see one Chris Ramsey it's
3092.24s: not this like schroden jur like wave you
3094.32s: know of many possibilities Chris Ramsey
3096.88s: yeah and I think it points to the fact
3100.12s: that we are rendering reality internally
3103.00s: sure that wave function collapse
3104.72s: actually occurs within the brain and so
3107.24s: if that's the case then like I I am R I
3110.64s: am rendering something that is different
3112.56s: the my map inside my head is different
3115.12s: than the territory and the random of
3116.80s: generator might not actually be
3119.28s: explained by me you
3122.40s: know emitting some sort of photon or
3125.32s: some you know some some like you know
3127.60s: unobtanium particle or whatever that
3129.96s: like we you know science hasn't
3131.16s: discovered yet to affect the thing in uh
3134.24s: the material world but it actually just
3136.44s: shows that maybe the whole material
3137.88s: world is sort of somewhat rendered
3139.88s: inside of me yeah not just you not me
3143.08s: obviously everybody because I see the
3144.44s: same thing you see that's right and then
3146.28s: and then there's some sort of uh
3148.16s: consensus collapsing function between
3150.00s: all of us yeah no you can't be this ends
3152.72s: in solipsism if it's just a single
3154.72s: person or whatever but yeah no um
3156.72s: there's some sort of like consensus then
3158.68s: that like you know reduces that on a on
3161.04s: a macroscopic yeah so how do you that's
3163.00s: what I'm saying is like what happens
3164.36s: when we when we start affecting that you
3166.84s: know rather than individually we have
3168.76s: these little goals because what if I
3170.20s: want to manifest you know something and
3172.72s: you want to manifest the opposite like
3174.68s: who wins yeah do you know what I mean so
3177.36s: like what does that look like when you
3179.64s: get multiple people manifesting or or
3182.40s: you know sort of collapsing these wave
3184.08s: functions together you know how big of a
3186.96s: change can you create how big of a sort
3190.52s: of you know thing can you can you just
3193.04s: make appear like what is the limit to
3195.08s: that I think that's really exciting I
3196.92s: think so to I think so too and I think
3198.88s: we're living in a kind of you know an
3201.64s: axial age so to speak uh of like uh the
3205.80s: former meaning structures are just like
3208.12s: not as charismatic as they like or
3210.48s: organized religion is in you know
3212.04s: Decline and then science itself feels
3214.04s: like it's sort of slowing down yeah
3215.52s: stagnant it's stagnant and so it feels
3217.20s: like we're actually on the verge of like
3218.52s: a really a cool paradigm shift and often
3220.92s: this occurs um not at the peaks of
3223.28s: civilization but at the trough so like
3224.88s: the decline of Rome is when Christianity
3226.80s: really took off and uh you know what's
3229.32s: in store for us next as far as a meaning
3231.76s: system that makes sense in like a a
3234.80s: capitalist world of high growth and high
3237.28s: fertility you know Across the Western
3238.96s: world and you know other parts of the
3240.20s: world yeah maybe maybe it doesn't make
3242.40s: sense for other parts of the world
3243.56s: actually but to the extent it makes
3244.88s: sense in the Western World context it's
3247.40s: starting to not make as much sense and
3249.48s: so you grow up in this context and like
3252.44s: you have like wage stagnation you know
3254.68s: like you know the the manufacturing base
3256.80s: of like the Western World sort of being
3258.16s: outsourced and you have this like agency
3260.20s: Outsourcing like all of the tech is like
3262.16s: kind of dystopian and not super
3263.64s: charismatic it's all in the world of
3264.88s: bits and not the world of atams if you
3266.96s: look at like any sort of urban you know
3269.08s: environment it looks the exact same as
3270.68s: it did in the 70s or whatever so how do
3272.76s: you grow up in that environment and
3274.52s: think that you know and not be like
3276.00s: extremely nihilistic while uh your deao
3279.20s: religion is the Richard Dawkins Neil
3280.96s: degrass Tyson thing of like this is just
3282.72s: a h you're you're you're a happy
3284.76s: accident how do you move on in that and
3287.20s: so uh you need you need something else
3290.04s: and you just because you need it doesn't
3292.04s: mean it you can come up with something
3293.64s: in a contrived way but I do think
3295.84s: earnest searching in these areas in
3297.88s: these sort of like Bizarro anomaly space
3300.52s: or whatever and then trying to connect
3302.24s: that to ancient religions and science
3304.44s: itself is like you know probably a
3306.64s: worthy pursuit in this kind of macro
3308.88s: context yep I I don't like using I don't
3311.32s: like using the simulation word because
3313.88s: it feels like a video game I don't think
3315.28s: it's a video game at all no well it's
3317.04s: that's the nihilistic version of the
3318.48s: simulation but there's like a platonic
3320.28s: extremely meaningful version of the
3321.92s: simulation where it's like what's
3323.32s: outside of the simulation like level up
3325.08s: to the thing you know there's something
3326.72s: aspirational about it yeah exactly and
3328.92s: and but you know you look back and and
3331.40s: uh just the idea of everything is mental
3334.72s: is exactly that is like everything is in
3336.96s: your head nothing actually exists
3339.32s: nothing is there without the Observer
3342.08s: without Consciousness nothing exists
3343.72s: Consciousness is the fundamental sort of
3345.88s: thing that we experience and it's what
3347.76s: makes physical our physical reality real
3350.64s: thing um you know but I feel like we're
3353.16s: just on um a really complicated
3357.24s: trajectory to rediscovering what we
3359.80s: already know in some sense yeah and but
3363.16s: I think it's healthy because I think we
3364.96s: got to a point where we weren't
3368.88s: satisfied with the answers because we
3371.12s: have new instruments to sort of measure
3372.96s: reality that we say well we have these
3374.40s: new instruments it's it's our duty to
3376.12s: take these instruments and you know pin
3378.72s: them up against these theories that
3379.96s: we've had forever and now it's time to
3381.80s: question it's a very brave thing to do
3383.24s: and to to you know emancipate from
3385.32s: religion like that like did it's it it
3387.08s: takes a lot of guts and a lot of people
3388.44s: you know got burned at the stake for
3389.64s: stuff like that but all in all it's so
3393.24s: fun and interesting to see that all
3396.64s: these instruments and everything else as
3398.56s: we got further away are leading us back
3400.72s: to what seemingly we already knew you
3404.44s: know and it's very very very cool to to
3407.08s: understand that now some people find
3408.00s: that very frustrating because they don't
3409.32s: want to go back because they think like
3410.72s: oh no we've gone away from that but it's
3412.80s: just such a beautiful full circle moment
3414.68s: that we get to do that with these modern
3416.28s: instruments and then sort of find peace
3418.36s: there and be like oh we're good again
3420.44s: you know yeah totally and a lot of
3422.28s: scientists get sort of mystical I think
3423.96s: at the end of their tenure or even you
3425.80s: know some great accomplishment and they
3427.12s: say you know it just leads you to God
3429.12s: one of my favorite philosophers is this
3431.32s: 19th turn of the century turn of the
3433.08s: 19th century um Austrian philosopher
3435.56s: named Rudolph Steiner and he has this
3437.40s: model of a u and at the you know left
3440.56s: top of the U uh you are in communion
3443.20s: with God and then you have the classic
3445.04s: kind of you know uh the fall of Man yeah
3448.04s: um and then you know at the bottom of
3449.52s: the U it could be like you know kind of
3451.36s: Enlightenment era you know nii
3453.84s: proclaiming do God is dead and then you
3456.84s: know on the on the right top of the U
3458.84s: you have uh recommunity with God but by
3461.80s: our own you know volition Free Will and
3464.80s: I always found that to be an interesting
3466.68s: uh sort of model yeah and you're you're
3468.24s: describing an arc you know and and uh
3471.24s: what good story doesn't have an arc you
3473.76s: know so when I think of a lot of people
3475.20s: that have you know gone through hey they
3477.80s: were raised religious they've become
3480.52s: atheists and now they've stayed there
3482.40s: well that's two points and that makes a
3483.84s: line and that's not much of an arc you
3486.28s: know it takes it takes that other that
3488.76s: bottom and that questioning and
3490.32s: everything else for you to grow and for
3491.88s: you to learn and then that Arc is
3493.28s: complete and that makes a good story and
3494.68s: there's a reason why we're attracted to
3496.28s: good stories right and I don't want my
3499.04s: story to just be aign I like the ark and
3501.44s: so I want to I want to explore that and
3502.96s: I want to make this a full you know
3505.52s: enjoyable story for myself and I think
3508.88s: it's important to I I think it's
3510.56s: important like you said to recognize
3511.96s: that that that you know although that
3513.88s: that's the trajectory I mean it doesn't
3516.44s: necessarily mean that that's right for
3517.76s: everyone and we you know who knows maybe
3519.36s: you got a thousand lies to figure that
3520.64s: out but I I do believe that like
3522.36s: Naturally Speaking that that seems more
3525.88s: fulfilling than just you know Richard
3528.44s: Dawkins in my entire life and just dying
3531.32s: and falling into nothing I guess I don't
3532.92s: know yeah yeah that doesn't seem too
3534.76s: great yeah and either way either way
3537.32s: we're both gonna go there right so you
3538.92s: might as well enjoy yeah true and look
3541.16s: forward to something yeah yeah exactly
3543.44s: yeah not something I would have said
3544.36s: maybe 10 years ago though so it's
3545.56s: interesting yeah um let's go to the
3547.44s: third sighting okay yeah the third
3549.68s: sighting is with uh Lou alzando so
3552.24s: famous you know UFO whistleblower uh
3554.88s: involved in assap from never heard of
3556.48s: him yeah who's that guy um you know and
3559.76s: there's obviously controversy
3561.48s: surrounding him but uh he was nice
3563.24s: enough to host uh Omar um my my my good
3566.64s: friend from yes Theory shout out to Omar
3568.96s: uh and I at his house um I think in like
3571.96s: 2021 or 2020 it was end of 2021 no sorry
3575.52s: end of 2022 um and uh we're all hanging
3579.20s: out by his shed and he is talking about
3582.08s: how he's a very smart pretty polymathic
3584.80s: guy he's talking about how the Sun is uh
3587.44s: kind of a nuclear fusion reactor and
3589.64s: he's getting deep into like the science
3592.48s: and um and we had had an interesting day
3594.96s: and he had said actually like you know
3597.28s: he had mentioned that like uh the UFO
3599.20s: phenomena had followed him around and
3601.24s: entered his house and that's a common
3603.00s: thing in the UFO world where you study
3605.00s: in a government context all those guys
3606.92s: you know um col kellerer Biga like all
3609.56s: of them like had experiences that were
3611.20s: paranormal after doing what they did you
3613.64s: know on on Skinwalker Ranch I guess in
3615.36s: bigo's case he was the patron but you
3616.88s: know and so um uh we had that context in
3621.04s: mind and Omar actually you know had been
3623.36s: really wanting to see a UFO I don't
3624.96s: think he had seen one up and till that
3626.32s: point and uh so we're deep in in
3628.52s: conversation on you know this sort of
3629.96s: crazy science stuff and we just see over
3632.88s: the shed hard to gauge distance but
3636.28s: pretty far off in the distance I don't
3638.64s: know maybe
3640.04s: uh 5,000 10,000 meters I don't know hard
3643.36s: hard to say um we see a green Fireball
3647.24s: just shoot shoot up and uh uh all of us
3650.88s: are just like what the [ __ ] and and I
3652.88s: think specifically Lou had said that he
3656.44s: had seen green Fireballs in his house
3659.40s: and that's in imminent that's that's in
3661.52s: imminent he might have even told us that
3664.48s: that day I don't remember but um but
3666.64s: that was pretty wild seeing something
3668.28s: with
3669.72s: him interesting this was was this in a
3673.08s: clearing no no I mean the whole night
3675.28s: sky was super clear like there were no
3677.60s: trees around so it was it was in the sky
3680.08s: yeah it was in the sky it wasn't like
3681.16s: low tree level or anything you weren't
3683.44s: elevated it was it was up oh it was in
3685.28s: the sky saw it shoot across yeah I saw
3688.24s: it shoot across to the like and then the
3690.92s: the shed that we were right next to kind
3692.56s: of obstructed it at a certain point it
3694.96s: was it was very fleeting fast very fast
3698.56s: yeah could have been a like a meteorite
3700.36s: or something totally could have been a
3701.64s: meteor I don't know okay yeah so it was
3704.32s: that far that it could have been in
3705.96s: orbit yeah it yeah it could it could
3708.56s: have been in orbit but nonetheless
3711.00s: interesting that you mention that and
3713.20s: that green orbs you know are what he
3715.48s: said then that's what you saw so again
3718.20s: like I don't I mean I don't know yeah no
3720.72s: I'm there's there's no way we're going
3722.16s: to get to the bottom of what what that
3723.44s: was here uh but I'd like to I'd like to
3726.24s: think that you know I I always say this
3728.28s: even the sightings that I've had I can't
3729.92s: tell I'm not smart enough to tell you
3731.96s: what they are I don't have enough data I
3733.32s: don't know whether they're anything of
3735.64s: substance but I know how they made me
3737.20s: feel yeah exactly and I'd like to think
3740.80s: that that's exactly how I'd feel if I
3742.80s: did see a real craft yeah and I do think
3745.96s: know this is partially maybe
3747.44s: backtracking on my earlier statement of
3749.36s: like your eyes are like the most
3751.00s: important thing to trust I do think
3752.52s: looking for repeatable patterns with the
3754.36s: UFO thing is important and interesting
3757.28s: and unfortunately due to the scientific
3760.52s: Paradigm basically uh discounting
3763.80s: anything dealing with Consciousness like
3765.44s: if you're having like a psychedelic if
3766.72s: it's like psychedelic trips and breath
3768.24s: work they're just going to write it off
3769.72s: forever and there's no way you can say
3772.08s: oh it's like a window into a thing
3773.64s: that's actually objective but like it's
3775.16s: like night vision you're just seeing
3776.32s: another part of the spectr you know what
3777.72s: there's no way to win that argument um
3781.36s: but I do think like the uh like I take
3784.20s: the like the nuclear uh employees like
3786.92s: Robert Hastings work and all these
3789.08s: nuclear employees seeing stuff in the
3791.12s: sky I take that probably more seriously
3794.00s: than my own experiences those people are
3796.60s: drug tested and like yeah right they're
3799.80s: they're they're on the PRP program so
3801.20s: they to report if they're taking
3802.24s: ibuprofen they're guarding kind of the
3803.68s: crown jewels of American defense you
3805.20s: could say they're under high stress
3806.92s: because of you know this a lot of this
3808.60s: stuff was like sort of Cold War era um
3811.52s: but at the same time they they see like
3813.40s: kind of a repeatable architecture they
3815.28s: often see green red uh you know uh uh
3818.64s: white balls of light uh uh saucers Tic
3821.48s: Tacs you know typical UFO structures
3824.40s: that you see and they're often tampering
3826.36s: with the comms links or shutting down
3827.88s: missile silos or you know uh uh in
3830.36s: certain cases people even claim to you
3832.36s: know board crafts and so uh yeah would I
3836.20s: would uh you know put more stock in that
3838.92s: in from like a consensus scientific you
3841.16s: know standpoint yeah even then my own
3844.12s: experiences sure yeah that's what I mean
3845.56s: for me as well I would probably trust
3847.20s: them a little bit more but I'm sure
3849.92s: they're smart enough to also question
3851.44s: their own you know sightings yeah yeah
3854.72s: well it's tough I think some of these
3857.48s: guys um they get so they've experienced
3861.20s: so much push back from the consensus
3863.84s: people and they have these other kind of
3865.52s: brother Brothers in Arms who've
3866.56s: experienced the same thing where they're
3868.28s: like what the like why wouldn't you
3869.76s: believe me you know and so I think then
3871.56s: that caused them to dig their heels in a
3873.12s: little bit more and probably just not
3875.28s: you know doubt what they and in certain
3876.80s: cases they have physical marks from you
3878.96s: know the abductions and there's no
3881.36s: arguing with the fact that the missile
3883.56s: silos were down and the stories get
3885.88s: changed in the way that they're reported
3887.32s: to like sort of mainstream price so like
3889.80s: I do think at that point I understand
3892.32s: some of them being like what the [ __ ]
3894.72s: like not lying you know um but but yeah
3898.88s: I mean I always think you know a little
3900.44s: dose of humility is is good for for
3902.80s: everybody okay um let me ask you this
3906.52s: this is a we're going to we're going to
3907.88s: jump ship a little bit to a little bit
3909.84s: of a a thought
3912.28s: experiment which
3914.84s: UFO
3916.64s: story do you so badly want to be
3920.08s: real and I'm not saying I'm not saying
3922.24s: you believe it yeah I'm saying which one
3924.44s: do you want to be real I don't know I I
3928.44s: my like genuine answer to that question
3930.96s: is I don't know if I have one where I'm
3932.92s: like this this one like I hold more
3935.32s: weight in but that's not the question
3937.40s: I'm not asking if you hold weight in it
3939.52s: if I want it to be real yeah so like for
3941.84s: instance oh like that like somehow would
3943.88s: create like a world that's like better
3945.64s: or more interesting than the others dumb
3947.52s: example ET yeah yeah yeah you know that
3949.88s: one's cool I like that one but out of
3952.56s: all the UFO stories that you've heard of
3954.40s: all like actual real UF TR to Bob to
3957.48s: anything at all to ttb to like you know
3960.64s: obviously that might be the answer I
3962.60s: love the town of brown one because he
3964.28s: like he like downloaded it was like a
3966.84s: zip file of like all of his work he was
3969.36s: spent a lot of time in Catalina and this
3971.16s: was I think he was like 17 years old and
3973.40s: he he uh interacted with this orbits
3975.56s: that had approached him this is his
3977.36s: daughter recounting this and um he just
3980.20s: downloaded his life's work and his life
3982.60s: had everything to do with like exotic
3984.40s: high voltage experimentation that you
3986.12s: know could eventually possibly lead to
3987.52s: gravity manipulation and you know we
3989.52s: only have four forces and physics and
3991.72s: only two of them are long range and only
3993.40s: one of them we can you know make any use
3995.24s: of in in a lab or in the physical world
3997.92s: and uh you know that's just so inspiring
3999.88s: it's like the fact that you can get some
4001.60s: sort of uh revelatory like hierophany as
4005.28s: like Diana Pula would say and that would
4007.36s: lead to your life's work as so that's so
4010.24s: cool so I would say that one yeah yeah
4013.00s: my by the way uh my Discord said they're
4015.32s: playing a drinking game every time you
4016.72s: said that Thomas towns and brown or
4019.12s: ontology we'd have to take a shot that's
4022.28s: hilarious yeah you guys are GNA be
4026.28s: waste um yeah that guy's super
4028.44s: interesting man um you know I'm I I'm
4032.36s: fully looking forward to the book that
4034.12s: you'll inevitably eventually write about
4035.76s: this guy because I don't think anyone's
4037.64s: gone as deep as you have um on this
4040.56s: subject with this gentleman I think
4042.84s: everything that's adjacent to him or
4045.20s: tangent Gally involved with this
4047.56s: gentleman you've you've gone down that
4051.40s: rabbit hole like no matter how
4052.96s: ridiculous it sounds if I if I mention
4055.68s: anything with whether it's time travel
4058.72s: or like some type of like nuclear fusion
4061.08s: during that time or gravity manipulation
4064.20s: around you know the 50s era you I just
4067.32s: see you light up like a Christmas tree
4069.44s: it's wild yeah that that axis of the UFO
4073.24s: stuff is the most interesting to me and
4075.92s: I don't quite know why but I F I just
4077.96s: find it so fascinating and I do I you
4082.08s: know what I think it's because it's so
4084.56s: not part of the Zeitgeist of you know
4088.60s: whatever is being discussed in like UFO
4091.28s: whistleblower world like it's existed
4094.12s: entirely on its own and like I'm very
4096.84s: supportive of a lot of these
4098.12s: whistleblowers coming out I think it's
4099.36s: amazing I think we live in this like
4100.84s: historic time as a result of that stuff
4103.28s: but uh it still feel feels like more
4106.24s: political and then you have this other
4108.12s: stuff where it's like it just kind of
4109.44s: like entered my life in this like
4110.88s: interesting serendipitous way and most
4114.80s: people weren't I mean there was this
4116.20s: like before Times Forum which is like
4118.80s: that you know the darkest corners of the
4120.60s: web these like hardcore towns and brown
4123.20s: you know researchers so I do want to
4124.56s: give credit to that I appreciate you
4125.84s: saying I'm very deep on the topic but
4127.60s: there's this woman named Jan lanquist
4129.24s: who's incredibly deep on Paul shatkin he
4131.24s: wrote the biography is great um and uh
4135.04s: you know that was that was kind of it um
4137.48s: and Nick cook even who wrote a history
4139.48s: of you know American and and Nazi
4141.80s: inquiries into
4143.08s: anti-gravity uh he the first you know 50
4146.80s: or so pages of that book are basically
4148.68s: dedicated to Thomas towns and brown and
4151.68s: he doesn't know what to make of brown
4153.08s: because he was like he's associated with
4154.32s: The Philadelphia Experiment which
4155.92s: seemingly has all this you know like
4157.52s: disinfo associated with it it's kind
4159.16s: seems kind of quacky you know it it
4161.60s: comes out through this U pseudonym
4163.96s: Carlos aende it's really Carl Allen this
4166.72s: you know Merchant Marine or whatever and
4169.80s: uh and he just doesn't know how to make
4171.80s: sense of the you know towns and brown
4173.40s: stuff and a lot of his experiments were
4175.68s: seemingly debunked at the time when in
4177.84s: fact I think he was actually kind of
4179.20s: running a lot of disinfo about his own
4182.40s: experiments he was doing that about
4184.64s: about his own experiments yeah he had um
4186.60s: he it was called the wounded uh uh the
4188.68s: wounded prairie chicken routine and he
4191.20s: even this is the most genius thing he
4193.24s: ever did uh he created an experiment and
4196.12s: this is you'd appreciate this in Magic
4197.84s: World he created an experiment that is
4200.84s: 95% uh similar to the real experiment uh
4204.80s: but that
4205.96s: uses the makes use of uh ion wind as
4209.96s: thrust and that was the main critique of
4213.16s: his real experiment so he would use
4215.20s: these capacitors these solid dialectric
4217.68s: to uh create this sort of weight
4219.08s: reduction effect like basically anti
4220.76s: anti-g gravitic effect and um he he also
4224.52s: had a a fluid dialectric which involves
4226.84s: these like copper wires and tin foil and
4229.24s: that creates the you know this this
4231.28s: positive this this ion wind uh thing and
4234.36s: that that creates thrust in that case
4236.44s: and the ion wind was how they would
4238.20s: debunk the solid gravit solid state
4240.56s: gravitator as well and so he popularized
4243.36s: the thing that was 95% similar to the
4245.72s: correct thing and you could see this
4247.48s: online people still it looks like an
4248.80s: eighth grade science experiment with
4250.40s: this DIY like kind of lifter technology
4252.68s: or whatever and so it's fascinating it's
4254.88s: it was like an amazing way to throw
4256.72s: people off the trail and he did that
4258.44s: after in 1950 he was um stationed at
4262.28s: Pearl Harbor and a Soviet born janitor
4265.52s: spy for for the Soviets uh compromised
4268.36s: his experiments and he freaked out and
4270.80s: that's when he created this wounded
4272.04s: prairie chicken routine and he had a
4273.36s: diary that he wrote in I believe until
4275.76s: around that time 1951 or 52 and then he
4278.12s: sto the diary entries go blank at that
4280.40s: point as well so that's when he kind of
4282.16s: goes off
4283.44s: grid you think he uh
4286.56s: you just like time traveled somewhere a
4290.36s: lot well you know we talked about this
4291.92s: last night as well you have you know uh
4293.96s: Back to the Future you have Doc Brown
4296.16s: EMT TT Brown so Thomas towns and brown
4298.88s: he flies on his flux capacitor towns and
4300.80s: Brown's experiments are flux Capac or
4302.40s: you know capacitor based um Mr Fusion is
4305.52s: is powering it he he spent the rest of
4307.28s: his life looking for a power source to
4308.76s: support the megga Volt range electricity
4311.04s: that would pump into the you know the
4313.36s: the experiment the the electromagnetism
4314.84s: into the experiment and so it's called
4316.96s: yeah Mr Fusion um and he uh in Back to
4320.52s: the Future I believe it takes place in
4321.88s: 1985 and that is you know the year towns
4324.80s: of Brown dies and um and then he goes
4327.48s: back to 1957 which is when in the
4330.12s: American context at the bonson labs uh
4333.40s: by the way one of the rumored Majestic
4335.36s: 12 guys Gordon gray the president of
4337.12s: UNCC Chapel Hill at the time he uh
4339.88s: proves his his experiment out um uh in
4343.36s: at The Institute of field physics and so
4345.28s: it's this bizarre like accurate and he
4347.64s: was called Doc Brown in in um you know
4350.04s: real life and Doc Brown is the character
4352.16s: in you know Back to the Future so wild
4354.72s: simulation well simulation or Steven
4358.48s: Spielberg who made Close Encounters of
4360.40s: the Third Kind has crates with
4362.32s: skunkworks and TRW skunkworks at you
4365.40s: know locky TRW at Northrup the two
4368.08s: organizations most associated with UFO
4371.08s: reverse engineering and you know clearly
4373.80s: has had some inside info if you look at
4375.44s: ET you know the the kind of like the
4377.80s: Locking on to Jake Barber didn't invent
4380.44s: locking onto the craft you have in ET
4382.88s: you have this kind of like hybridization
4384.64s: between the child and you know the ET um
4388.36s: and so I think uh you know people like
4390.80s: Stephen Spielberg Christopher Nolan you
4392.88s: know James Cameron like those guys have
4395.04s: to be you know fed some interesting info
4397.16s: at I either fed but you know if I were
4400.04s: to make a Hollywood movie being a fan of
4403.92s: euphology if that's a word
4405.80s: um I would also like it to be as close
4408.72s: to the real thing as possible right so I
4410.64s: might also populate it with skunk work
4412.56s: stuff and yep eg&g stuff or you know
4415.40s: rathon whatever like you know oh I'm
4417.72s: saying fed like real stuff yeah but but
4420.20s: I mean like as as a as a as a fan I
4422.72s: would go out of my way to drop those
4425.56s: Easter eggs in sure sure and Stephen
4427.20s: Spielberg I think has a deep interest in
4429.12s: is a fan yeah like he you had James Fox
4431.16s: on I think one of James Fox's uh you had
4433.80s: a letter it was like out of the blue or
4435.40s: one of his first movies uh yeah see goes
4439.28s: this yeah ex I think it was out of the
4441.84s: yeah um so yeah I mean the fact that and
4444.08s: James Fox was not a big name at the time
4446.20s: you know um so yeah I think he's a
4448.04s: pretty hardcore hardcore fan there's an
4450.40s: early interview of uh of Spielberg
4453.32s: talking about talking about UFOs as well
4456.52s: I forget exactly when it was but he was
4459.28s: like super young and he was like he was
4461.76s: he was like oh yeah you know we got
4463.16s: these things and there's like he was
4464.32s: talking about all this stuff and then
4465.60s: all of a sudden shut up about it right
4467.44s: and started making movies about it
4468.72s: instead well he uh there's a quote from
4471.44s: Robert uh leafield who's the creator of
4474.08s: Deadpool and Robert leafield says yeah
4476.64s: like I remember the time when uh uh
4478.88s: stepen Spielberg told me that the UFOs
4480.92s: were actually Time Travelers and they
4482.60s: were not uh uh ETS he says he says what
4486.16s: do you think like you know like idiot
4488.64s: like parthy doesn't say idiot but it's
4490.16s: like what do you think do you think it's
4491.68s: more likely that they're just from you
4493.12s: know Zeta reticuli they're from like you
4494.80s: know thousands of light years away or
4497.16s: they're us from the future protecting
4499.60s: you know timelines or whatever so some
4502.20s: Michael P Masters stuff perhaps yeah
4504.68s: maybe exact totally yeah shout out to
4507.12s: Michael Master yeah he he might have
4508.96s: been watching those podcasts too I
4511.32s: wouldn't put it past him you know it's
4512.92s: you'd be surprised who watches your
4514.44s: videos yeah it's always a it's always a
4516.80s: trip like I'm not I didn't have
4518.20s: Instagram like three years ago like I
4520.36s: didn't it's like kind of while yeah but
4522.44s: I mean people a lot of people who are
4524.24s: you know
4525.52s: um not active but our celebrities or or
4528.60s: politicians or whatever they're not
4530.84s: always
4533.32s: commenting but they are sharing it to
4535.36s: people you know and uh even was James
4538.00s: Fox you just mentioned said that uh it
4539.96s: is mandatory to watch the phenomenon y
4542.52s: for Arrow that's awesome on the podcast
4545.12s: he said in Arrow they said it was
4546.40s: mandatory yeah to watch well it makes
4548.96s: sense cuz I I've you know been in rooms
4552.08s: with people in DC where I'm like given
4554.04s: your credentials you should know so much
4556.00s: more about this topic than that's that
4558.28s: is what's so weird about this topic and
4560.20s: it's why I think people like Joe Rogan
4563.24s: reasonably get so exhausted and are like
4566.16s: [ __ ] that this is ridiculous yeah
4567.76s: because nobody's adding anything to the
4569.04s: conversation well nobody adds anything
4570.64s: to the conversation and whatever org
4572.68s: structure this operates under is like
4575.56s: over the head like the maybe the meta
4577.56s: conspiracy about the whole thing is that
4579.52s: like again all the three body problem
4582.16s: like the aliens have their own
4584.00s: scientific military-industrial complex
4586.60s: program and the managerial system like
4589.52s: we we have human clearance systems but
4592.04s: in fact like it's like the deputy and
4594.80s: like the middle manager of the guy and
4597.40s: the person on top who you would expect
4599.16s: to know doesn't know and I've seen this
4601.56s: multiple times and so that that's what's
4604.28s: so confusing and weird about it's like
4606.24s: some like hermetically you know uh in
4609.28s: meshed thing yeah and it's not even a a
4611.64s: compartmentalization problem no it's
4614.08s: just a purely
4616.60s: just you have no knowledge of what's
4618.44s: going on like it so it on the one hand
4621.32s: it's compartmentalized but I actually
4623.56s: think the underrated thing to point out
4625.68s: is how interwoven and weirdly linked it
4629.72s: is it's it's like a a no chain of
4631.60s: authority issue like it's um you know uh
4634.76s: UAP ger who has this amazing Channel um
4637.48s: talks about all these like ffr DCS you
4640.12s: know and then academic research you know
4642.24s: Fally funded uh organizations as well
4644.64s: and it's like this these and they're
4646.80s: often like the the money gets funneled
4648.60s: into them and then they have like little
4651.92s: carve outs of classified prosaic
4654.64s: programs that are like dual use for the
4656.88s: alien thing and it is so hard to wrap
4659.92s: your head around it's just extremely
4662.12s: weird like when you learn things like oh
4663.68s: maybe Star Wars like the Strategic
4665.44s: Defense Initiative had something to do
4666.88s: with the UFO thing and uh you know yeah
4670.80s: you you get into all sorts of um
4672.84s: interesting questions it's not as
4674.08s: clearcut as as you would like it to be
4675.72s: anyway no yeah no it's not and it's not
4677.96s: one department and it's like and it's
4679.88s: like it's purposely offc through it's
4682.24s: extremely complicated was like the cia's
4685.00s: office of scientific intelligence Batel
4686.68s: Memorial Institute with all the nuclear
4688.36s: stuff but the Office of Naval
4690.16s: intelligence was I think ahead of
4692.24s: everybody on on this stuff like when Bob
4694.96s: was getting his paychecks from too
4696.68s: that's fascinating I right I've heard
4698.60s: that and I've heard uh of people high up
4701.28s: in the Navy being like don't [ __ ]
4703.92s: talk about bobbles are and I think Jim
4705.84s: Goodall told me an interesting story
4707.60s: about about that actually went into some
4710.36s: high up Navy Admiral and yeah I don't I
4713.80s: don't know how many stars but like you
4715.24s: know interesting Guy and um the guy I
4718.64s: think he had like Bob lazar's resume or
4720.44s: something and like the guy like freaked
4722.32s: out at him and uh yeah yeah yeah and was
4725.64s: like like I never want to see this again
4727.72s: you know that's interesting because the
4729.76s: um the there was The Whistleblower on
4732.32s: forchan and you know give that as much
4734.80s: Credence as you'd like but if you call
4737.48s: it whistleblower whatever um but
4740.60s: actually you know if true did a lot more
4743.40s: whistleblowing than a lot of people uh I
4745.48s: know you know what I mean didn't get
4747.24s: Doster approved whistleblowing to go on
4749.40s: forun but uh basically came out and said
4752.36s: that like these MCU these mobile
4753.92s: construction units were maneuvering you
4755.44s: know in the oceans and whatnot and that
4757.36s: this guy was part of this crash
4758.40s: retrieval system he was like number two
4760.60s: which you know number one gets the
4761.80s: bodies in the in the e115 number two
4763.92s: would get the components on the inside
4765.52s: of the craft and three and four would
4766.52s: take away the bulk um and so that was
4769.20s: that was kind of his job and somebody
4771.96s: asked well what about Lou alzando and
4774.20s: Steven Greer and like these people and
4776.76s: he answers I don't know who those people
4778.72s: are but one name you didn't mention is
4781.04s: Bob Lazar and saying that name around
4783.20s: here would get you taken out and put
4784.56s: down like a dog wow and he goes do you
4787.48s: do the math on why wow yeah it's
4790.44s: fascinating so you know and and man that
4793.68s: that whole doc that whole Q&A that this
4796.48s: guy did on forchan haunts me to this day
4799.96s: cuz he said something in there that's he
4801.88s: said notice yourself coming back to this
4806.04s: as more information is discovered or
4808.52s: unfold and it's exactly what I've been
4810.76s: doing exactly what everybody's been
4811.96s: doing my my you know the comments the
4813.84s: people watch the videos are all like
4815.04s: dude this is like what the 4chan guy
4817.24s: said and it keeps coming up yeah every
4819.76s: every whistleblower every Congressional
4822.08s: hearing um that document mentions
4825.00s: psionics yeah the word psionics w did it
4827.84s: really yes absolutely that's fascinating
4829.72s: I didn't know that that's really
4830.92s: fascinating it mentions it mentions um
4833.72s: because at one point uh there was a
4837.04s: question is there uh you know is there
4838.84s: any type of like psychic interface or
4840.80s: whatever and and he goes there is one
4842.76s: instance of psionics and he's like but
4845.08s: he's like I don't know if it was that or
4847.28s: if it was like remote control so what
4848.88s: happened was they got apparently into
4851.00s: the craft the craft was downed and the
4854.48s: they they he didn't seem to think that
4857.04s: they were taking them down by the way he
4859.04s: said that there are certain spots
4860.48s: especially in Mexico that these crafts
4863.04s: would literally avoid because they went
4864.84s: down too many times like these guys make
4866.32s: mistakes yep and he's like they used to
4868.08s: be did he say in Mexico yeah Mexico I've
4870.68s: yeah I heard some interesting stuff
4871.84s: around that that's what George knap just
4873.56s: covered in his Netflix doc and he says
4876.04s: they avoid it like the plague
4877.32s: interesting and he's like before we'd
4879.40s: see a lot more bodies uh but he's like
4881.48s: now they're like pretty much unmanned
4883.96s: because they've been going down they
4885.00s: know that we've been collecting them and
4887.32s: you know even sometimes they they it's
4889.56s: weird but they'll like
4891.48s: um I mean there's a whole bunch of weird
4893.76s: interactions with with this stuff but
4895.56s: this time they get called in so what he
4898.68s: assumes uh the people go in before him
4901.08s: take the element 115 cuz he said it was
4903.40s: 115 MH and they also so he said it was a
4907.16s: stable version of it uh he doesn't know
4909.32s: he doesn't handle it and he and he and
4910.92s: he said he was surprised that Bob
4912.24s: handled it okay he's like because
4914.76s: normally it's um you don't touch with
4917.84s: your hands and and it's only one guy and
4920.36s: it's a very important thing like no one
4922.04s: else is allowed even seeing it or
4924.00s: touching it's so delicate and like
4926.88s: compartmentalized that E15 because it's
4929.36s: like super rare you can't find it on
4930.68s: earth like it's it's um so one guy gets
4934.28s: it and they get the bodies and once
4936.40s: they're out then team two gets called in
4939.36s: and then team two goes in to clean out
4941.04s: like the tools and all of the sort of
4943.36s: you know compartments and all of the all
4945.48s: the the loose hanging stuff components
4948.60s: and so they go in to do their job and
4950.68s: the back of the craft apparently starts
4952.48s: closing like the hatch starts closing
4954.60s: and he goes I wish I wore brown pants
4956.52s: that day he's like it was very scary and
4958.52s: then so they radioed out to team one and
4961.28s: they were like hey team one and they go
4964.16s: they're like the door's closing he goes
4965.40s: hold on and all of a sudden the door
4967.56s: started opening and he goes you clear
4968.96s: and they go yeah so he knew they had the
4972.28s: bodies what so he's not sure whether it
4974.96s: was like maybe he said maybe it was like
4976.80s: a remote control or yeah these beings
4980.60s: were
4981.64s: alive you know and and and did that
4984.00s: under duress or something oh Jesus yeah
4987.20s: um one of the darker things that he said
4989.48s: in that Q&A was he found uh one time
4994.40s: there was a down craft with an AB abduct
4996.28s: he on
4997.64s: board that yeah so dead dead person and
5001.56s: you know Pilots yeah yeah I've heard
5005.04s: of rumors of the Aztec crash in 1948
5007.72s: that you know 16 little but there's
5012.20s: there's I don't know if this is right
5014.08s: but that that's actually what caused
5017.44s: Forest doall who was uh oh to go over
5020.60s: the edge to go over the edge he was very
5022.00s: religious and he was Secretary of the
5023.64s: Navy and then he became uh Secretary of
5025.88s: Defense and I believe he was speaking to
5028.36s: the um to the priest to the head of the
5030.60s: Air Force oh and uh was was hearing this
5033.28s: description of like mutila
5035.00s: like human and alien bodies together and
5037.76s: it sent and that's he was checked into
5039.56s: this you know Navy hospital in Bethesda
5041.64s: Maryland you know very soon after but
5043.72s: this fourchant thing I mean you're
5045.24s: making me want to just go back and do a
5047.16s: deep dive on I mean that's I I read the
5049.24s: whole thing four parts it's like four
5051.04s: and a half hours total yeah um of going
5053.92s: through the entire the mobile
5056.24s: construction units where they they each
5058.40s: UFOs built to spec mhm and giant
5061.28s: hamburger shaped UFOs with no lights on
5063.24s: them so massive they move extremely fast
5067.84s: underwater so this is exactly what you
5069.72s: know Lou was talking about mhm which
5071.96s: came out after once again right and he
5074.56s: said you'll come back to this yeah yeah
5076.68s: yeah yeah um and he was dying and so
5080.04s: that that that gave him the Liberty to
5081.80s: that's what he said oh if I were to
5085.24s: throw a red herring in there sure
5087.12s: because a lot of people were like cuz he
5088.48s: said he had liver cancer and he's like
5089.72s: liver cancer will make you do you know
5091.20s: crazy things and whatever mhm and people
5093.68s: were like well that'll just give you
5095.56s: away cuz they'll know who has liver
5097.84s: cancer yeah right and I'm like that's
5100.12s: why he probably doesn't have liver
5101.32s: cancer right right you know what I mean
5103.48s: yeah that's probably why you know some
5105.80s: other reason I don't know what it is but
5107.60s: definitely he he even said there will be
5109.52s: red herrings yep um what else did he say
5112.48s: that was proven correct that was well I
5115.40s: mean that was proven correct I not not
5117.40s: proven but corroborated by further
5119.40s: testimony so this thing is in uh in the
5122.76s: region of the Bermuda Triangle mhm right
5125.48s: so the Atlantic Ocean and a lot of Naval
5128.08s: bases there um a lot of things coming in
5130.56s: and out of the water yep um you know if
5133.20s: you look at uh nits and all that stuff I
5136.12s: mean this is kind of where we saw Tic
5138.12s: Tacs and and all of that stuff as well
5140.28s: right so this is kind of same area um
5143.84s: you
5144.96s: know uh what else was there I mean he
5147.12s: talked about he talked about the Grays
5148.80s: that they were just like great he did
5150.76s: say that they had
5152.20s: genitalia inter which I thought was Weir
5154.72s: well that's that's uh yeah Cuts against
5156.80s: a lot of reports yeah does yeah but he
5159.12s: did also say four fingers uh which does
5161.92s: cut which does kind of make sense yeah C
5164.76s: rate um but again he I I don't think he
5168.72s: said so 2002 he said was a was a really
5172.52s: important
5173.80s: date um 2002 was an important year and
5176.48s: he kept emphasizing that and he's and he
5178.40s: said that's when sort of leadership
5180.32s: changed and that's when he left the
5182.56s: program he said the people who were in
5185.00s: charge were very much they wanted the
5188.08s: story to come out a little bit more and
5190.48s: they were working with the Air Force Air
5191.96s: Force was frustrated because they can't
5193.68s: say anything and they wanted it to come
5196.00s: out but then new leadership came in and
5199.04s: tightened down clamped down in 2002 he's
5202.00s: like that was like you know and so
5205.64s: that's right after like 911 you know and
5208.64s: after you know the Pentagon thing
5210.12s: happened and all that right so I don't
5211.68s: know maybe it has something to do with
5212.76s: that maybe a change at the top and they
5214.28s: were like hey right time to clamp down
5216.12s: well I remember that there was that
5217.16s: Rumsfeld speech of like we're missing
5219.64s: over a trillion dollars in like the
5221.28s: defense budget before 911 and so and you
5225.12s: had you know this Katherine Austin Fitz
5227.16s: this sort of uh uh whistleblower
5229.28s: government whistleblower who talks about
5231.40s: billions and billions of dollars going
5233.00s: missing and and and probably having to
5234.52s: deal with black money and you know I
5236.56s: think she actually took an interest in
5238.96s: kind of exotic Science and Technology
5241.36s: programs as a result it sort of led her
5243.28s: there the search
5245.04s: um I mean to this day they've never
5246.68s: passed an audit anyway still now they're
5250.08s: not blowing up the Pentagon every other
5251.96s: day they just not no passing these
5254.76s: audits sure yeah no and I I do wonder if
5257.92s: something happened at that time there's
5259.28s: also a story of Hell put off uh advising
5262.40s: the George W Bush Administration and I
5264.84s: think like the 0304 time frame on they
5267.64s: did like this net assessment with their
5269.64s: National Security adviser named Steven
5271.48s: Hadley on whether disclosure would be
5273.76s: worth it and how put off is saying this
5275.56s: in front of an audience of you know tons
5277.36s: of people at Stanford for the soul
5279.48s: foundation and um they came out of this
5282.76s: assessment saying that they they thought
5284.24s: it would be too disruptive and not you
5286.36s: know worth it and he speaks how sort of
5288.84s: cryptically on like what those reasons
5290.36s: are because then you give away what the
5291.80s: you know maybe underlying truth is sure
5294.04s: um but that's fascinating that he was
5295.72s: even in those conversations and that
5297.40s: those conversations may have have taken
5299.44s: place there's also a woman I've become
5302.32s: uh uh friends with who's a great UFO
5304.24s: researcher whose father is sort of a
5305.76s: legend in the UFO world uh uh because
5309.48s: he's been tweeting so much and very
5311.28s: sadly he just passed away her name is
5313.28s: Pippa malmgren and uh her father is is
5316.16s: Harold malmgren and she was special uh
5319.84s: assistant uh to George W bush and and um
5324.08s: you know doing I think on his like
5325.80s: Economic Council and uh she said some
5328.80s: some interesting things about that that
5330.60s: review and um I think they may have been
5332.68s: reading the three body problem whoa
5335.04s: which is pretty interesting I keep
5336.76s: hearing that man yeah yeah a lot of
5339.72s: people think it has to do with like the
5341.00s: date being thrown around and and you
5343.00s: know that type of deal it's like and you
5345.24s: know you think
5347.16s: of you know if that is the case if you
5352.20s: know we know of some encroaching amuaa
5356.12s: or whatever it is you know coming here
5358.44s: some massive Mothership or whatever
5360.28s: giving us a heads up on some level um we
5364.32s: might we might just be in a race yep
5367.68s: yeah and that I mean there's it's very
5371.04s: unlikely that whatever disclosure we're
5372.76s: going to get involves these like uh very
5376.68s: discreet It Whatever alien presence
5379.32s: exists allaha John Keel or or jacqu fet
5382.92s: it's weakly entangled with our reality
5385.16s: and it seems like it's sort of um in
5387.68s: meshing itself slowly with us over over
5390.36s: time that's kind of three body problemes
5392.24s: as well like you can't just touch off
5394.52s: Mass Hysteria by saying you know we're
5397.00s: coming now and so I think it makes sense
5399.68s: from that perspective and it also makes
5401.16s: sense from the perspective of the way
5403.68s: science progresses and it seems to just
5406.88s: you go through these weird
5408.52s: stultification like stagnations over a
5410.76s: long periods of time then you get these
5411.84s: like Cambrian explosion of ideas and why
5414.64s: does that happen and then why is there's
5416.36s: a great book uh called bedeviled uh by
5419.32s: Prof Professor Hima K Canales and she
5422.24s: talks about um uh the history of demons
5425.16s: in science and like uh day har was shown
5428.24s: uh the cartisian plane you know kind of
5430.16s: the foundations of like our modern
5431.72s: science Itself by uh this demon while
5434.64s: he's like a soldier in the Prussian Army
5436.28s: and you have all these examples of that
5437.88s: throughout history so if you look at the
5439.24s: phenomenology of science itself it's
5441.68s: actually far more akin to Revelation and
5444.60s: it's not like you're you know dotting
5446.32s: the eyes crossing the te's you know you
5447.72s: finish an equation on the chalkboard
5449.12s: it's like you're in the shower you're
5450.24s: patent clerk Einstein at his desk or dck
5453.00s: staring at the fire or you know um
5455.32s: Heisenberg at helloand or all these
5457.56s: they're like you get zapped with the
5459.44s: idea or whatever um so so I think you
5462.24s: know there's a lot about the three body
5464.20s: problem that's fascinating the final
5465.36s: thing I'd say is uh China's relatively
5470.32s: closed society when it comes to kind of
5472.08s: information in and out and especially
5474.24s: when it comes to kind of heretical
5475.44s: contrarian ideas you know it's like Jack
5477.60s: Moss says like one bad thing about X or
5479.60s: whatever and he's like you know he's
5480.68s: like Persona n grata right and uh that
5484.04s: book is extremely critical of the
5485.96s: cultural revolution like it starts with
5487.96s: this like you know scene of this like uh
5491.68s: uh uh these scientists basically like
5493.76s: being like beaten to a pul is the
5495.52s: daughter of a scientist or whatever no I
5497.32s: think it is a scientist yeah ter
5498.84s: terrible scene terrible scene and um uh
5502.52s: you know it's like you believe in
5503.48s: Einstein you're you know yeah and uh uh
5506.20s: the CCP still pushes that book uh in
5509.72s: stem education in many context so you
5512.36s: have to ask yourself if it's so
5514.44s: like contrarian like why why would they
5517.60s: you know why would that communist
5518.88s: country push it out you'd expect it to
5520.92s: be treated like a tanaman squar query or
5523.80s: whatever you know not yeah but at the
5525.80s: same time the guy who owned the rights
5527.68s: to the book got poisoned and died that's
5529.64s: true you know not like they didn't go
5532.44s: out without a fight perhaps yeah yeah
5534.20s: yeah you know yeah yeah maybe it was
5536.20s: like they wanted to co-opt it if you
5538.44s: know it was going to yeah it it did it
5540.64s: did seem that way it did seem like it
5543.44s: did seem like more than a money thing
5545.44s: yeah although it was like one of the
5546.48s: bestselling books of all time for them
5548.16s: or whatever it was like a really really
5549.68s: good you know the book did really
5551.32s: incredibly well yeah so maybe from a
5553.36s: national pride perspective it's yeah or
5555.52s: cultural you know um cultural exporting
5559.04s: type deal maybe but yeah interesting
5561.76s: nonetheless and and and you know back to
5563.76s: the forchan underwater guy you know his
5567.64s: theory was you know he kept saying
5570.48s: higher ups uh just told him that they
5574.24s: don't really care about us they kind of
5577.08s: like they just don't care it's not like
5580.32s: they're benevolent or whatever they just
5582.12s: seem to not care and now he had this
5584.56s: like built a spec thing and he's and he
5586.36s: said the higher ups even told him is
5587.88s: like they treat this more like a zoo yep
5590.48s: and like they can't be bothered by the
5592.20s: day-to-day minutia of the animals but if
5594.84s: one of them breaks out or whatever they
5596.32s: got to kind of like clean it up and
5598.16s: control it but other than that like
5599.52s: knock yourselves out totally and then
5602.16s: you know his the theory that they had
5604.56s: that him and his higher-ups had was one
5606.20s: of two was either one they're protecting
5610.04s: us in order to wait for us to reach some
5613.28s: type of level of conscious awareness or
5616.12s: you know higher whatever higher
5618.00s: vibration or they're holding the planet
5621.76s: for something else for someone else that
5624.08s: that's coming to take what's rightfully
5626.56s: theirs that's you know and so if if you
5629.44s: want to play on that theory a little bit
5632.24s: the idea of okay okay let's say I'm
5634.92s: dotting around the Galaxy and populating
5637.12s: these different planets and making them
5639.64s: you know Thrive with these different
5641.76s: floor and fauna that I'm genetically
5643.88s: enhancing and I'm I've got 100,000
5645.68s: planets all at different stages you know
5647.84s: and we're dropping you know Metallurgy
5649.92s: over here and we got some you know
5652.76s: agriculture over here and and religion
5654.56s: over here and they're all just kind of
5655.52s: growing at their own different Paces um
5658.44s: but you'll want to set up some type of
5660.60s: AI fail safe to make sure that
5663.72s: everything cuz you don't want to have to
5665.64s: be there yourself like I mean there's so
5667.80s: many planets maybe there's a billion
5669.40s: planets that they're doing this to you
5671.20s: know to like Seed Life in in the
5673.08s: universe so instead well you would
5676.12s: develop this technology this giant craft
5680.24s: that lives at the depths of the oceans
5682.08s: at different points in the world that
5684.68s: deploys these undetectable you know sort
5688.12s: of craft that are built to spec and that
5690.80s: is piloted mostly by AI but sometimes by
5695.04s: these beings that are also AI in some
5699.12s: respect that are like low yeah you know
5702.16s: uh conscious beings that that just kind
5704.20s: of like are drone like yeah and they
5706.64s: just kind of deploy and they shoot out
5708.08s: to like when there's world problems and
5709.40s: they always come back into their own
5711.76s: home base he said like they never leave
5714.60s: space or come from out of space he's
5716.04s: like sometimes we'll see big ones come
5717.52s: in from space he said those are carriers
5720.08s: they're usually giant Tic Tac shapes and
5722.08s: he's like uh ship yeah well he said
5724.52s: there's um they've never shot one of
5726.80s: those down and he said if we can get one
5729.00s: down it's a guaranteed promotion they
5731.08s: were told well and I don't know if he
5733.32s: says this but Robert Hastings who wrote
5734.92s: UFOs nukes talks about motherships
5736.92s: saucers coming out of motherships yeah
5739.36s: and so the I could imagine that having
5741.36s: you know big multiplicative effect where
5743.80s: if you have these big cigar shaped
5745.12s: things you have a bunch of saucers in
5746.52s: there like I mean and and he says the
5748.88s: saucer shape too he's like when you
5750.40s: think of it this was really interesting
5752.08s: he's like when you think of it it's all
5753.36s: just um because they're built to
5756.16s: spec um so he's like put it this way you
5759.56s: have a plate of food and you want to
5761.00s: cover it up what do you do you put like
5764.20s: your tin foil over it what does that
5765.52s: look like a saucer that's all that's as
5768.16s: simple as it is they got stuff there
5769.76s: that they need to do and work on and
5771.64s: they want to just cover it up yeah yeah
5773.16s: yeah fascinating it's not more yeah
5775.64s: crazy than that that's that's the theory
5777.68s: right like he's like I can't stress
5779.60s: enough how to spec everything is built
5782.76s: he's like I
5784.24s: he's like for instance if they were
5785.72s: doing an abduction thing and they wanted
5787.00s: to abduct two people there would be two
5788.84s: rooms two beds all right let's say
5791.04s: there's uh two pilots then there' be two
5792.84s: seats and that's it close it up the
5794.84s: tools they need they fit in the wall
5796.56s: perfectly everything is just printed
5799.48s: well I mean if you look at where our you
5801.88s: know digital prowess is going with 3D
5805.24s: printing and then you look at like what
5806.52s: DARPA is looking into right now all
5808.48s: biological computation how do cells
5810.64s: perform you know low-level computational
5812.92s: tasks
5814.16s: uh you know how are they so
5815.36s: computationally efficient uh can you
5817.48s: program them to to get them to do things
5820.08s: you know can we create some sort of
5821.40s: anatomical compiler in the future where
5823.24s: you can 3D print biological life you
5825.48s: know we can do uh synthetic DNA meat
5828.56s: already and yeah all do synthetic
5830.36s: cultured meat or whatever we clone we've
5832.08s: done Dolly right yeah we've done Dolly I
5834.24s: mean yeah may maybe not the most
5835.60s: successful experiment but like no I mean
5837.72s: there's there's a startup I believe
5839.52s: called colossal biosciences trying to
5841.44s: bring back woolly mammoths right now so
5843.24s: we're definitely on the precipice of
5845.24s: something and there's a Korean uh doctor
5847.56s: that does a bunch of cloning in Dubai
5849.52s: that's fascina there's a whole
5850.64s: documentary on it w yeah for rich people
5852.80s: oh wow that's for their pets that's so
5854.48s: interesting so you could have like a
5855.48s: woly mammoth pet I met one I met a I met
5858.12s: the world's smallest Chihuahua teacup
5860.64s: Chihuahua oh my God Miracle Millie I
5863.40s: think her name was and they made 30 of
5865.36s: them how expensive were each there were
5867.32s: 30 grand or 100 Grand a piece and uh I
5870.76s: was I was with someone I won't say who
5872.84s: this person was they were a very
5874.72s: important person um and when I pet the
5877.68s: dog and uh we we were talking and and
5880.64s: this guy was getting into all sorts of
5882.12s: weird stuff and I go what about cloning
5883.72s: and he was like oh my dog's a clone and
5885.24s: I was like what he's like yeah the dog
5886.36s: you just pet he's like that was a clone
5887.96s: there was they made 30 of them and he
5889.56s: paid 100 Grand so there was a Netflix
5891.08s: documentary I saw later I was like oh
5892.80s: that's the guy he went to go see and
5894.84s: they they started off with uh cloning um
5897.92s: camel and horses and like these like uh
5901.28s: thoroughbred horses and stuff like
5902.92s: Arabian and stuff like that that were
5904.40s: worth you know millions of dollars cuz
5906.56s: they would breed right so well why don't
5908.16s: we just make another one but all of this
5911.32s: answerers also the number one detracting
5915.04s: kind of comment which is why would they
5916.32s: crash and like maybe they don't give a
5918.00s: [ __ ] maybe this is their Global hosting
5920.72s: kit that they deployed to the US or to
5922.88s: the not us to the to the to the world
5925.32s: and they are just it's literally and it
5927.56s: makes sense you have these Archimedes
5929.72s: lever you have these points of most
5931.68s: leverage where we could blow ourselves
5933.84s: up with nuclear and then you know maybe
5936.36s: this whole thing is somewhat of a
5938.08s: simulation again I don't like the word
5939.44s: simulation like you cuz that's a little
5941.44s: nihilistic but there's some purpose
5943.56s: around life and if you reach certain
5945.52s: States Of Consciousness you know you
5948.32s: light up and you're a node that lights
5950.36s: up for them or whatever Y and then so
5953.12s: those are the two things that they take
5954.52s: note of and otherwise you're like in
5956.56s: some system you're in like a suit
5958.60s: terarium and they don't you're in you're
5960.16s: in a little you know yeah Global Village
5962.08s: snow globe thing and it's it's cellular
5964.68s: automat maybe you hit you know hit a
5966.44s: node here hit a node there do an implant
5968.76s: here but yeah like to your point they
5970.88s: don't care if they're seen they don't
5972.32s: care if they see you and then you know
5974.16s: they don't care if their little Von
5975.20s: noyman replicator robot like gets popped
5977.84s: out of the sky or whatever like you know
5979.88s: maybe they get pissed over a long time
5981.64s: they get annoyed best probably at worst
5983.80s: yeah you hear rumors from you know uh
5986.24s: Legacy UFO programs they want their
5988.72s: stuff back and they're pissed or
5990.04s: whatever but like maybe it's not that
5992.20s: big of a deal for them you know I don't
5994.32s: think it is and that's what this guy
5995.36s: tended to say too he like it's not like
5996.76s: they're trying hard yeah to be
5999.88s: secretive um they're just kind of like
6002.92s: remaining under the radar their goal is
6004.68s: you know just to do their job undetected
6007.24s: but if they get detected because of our
6008.56s: Tech or or we're in the right place at
6010.32s: the right time they're like okay so be
6011.88s: it that's fascinating because you look
6013.52s: at the early crashes like Roswell you
6016.28s: know 47 I don't know if Trinity is real
6018.88s: there's debate about that you know Jac F
6020.68s: versus D Dean Johnson who knows but like
6023.00s: you know Aztec 48 and like uh you have
6026.68s: uh bodies involved in a lot of these and
6028.60s: if he's saying they're less involved
6030.08s: maybe that isn't maybe maybe they have
6031.64s: updated and they're like you know we're
6033.20s: just going to send our our drones out
6035.12s: yeah they lost too many bodies and like
6037.16s: and and he said sometimes which was
6038.84s: super weird he's like one of the early
6040.32s: ones he's like this is before I got
6041.80s: there he's like it was more like a bus
6043.96s: which is funny that you said bus earlier
6046.32s: uh and and he said uh it was it seemed
6048.60s: like it was more for viewing because it
6050.16s: had a lot of Windows and it was meant
6052.56s: for like many beings it's like a tourist
6056.28s: yeah kind of like kind of like let's go
6058.12s: see what's going on type deal might have
6060.20s: just been reconnaissance or or something
6062.44s: but yeah it they had some that were
6064.52s: meant for mining uh some that were yeah
6067.32s: they had all sorts of little like they
6069.16s: could tell what the point of the craft
6072.60s: was based on the inside the components
6074.56s: they found yeah and he's like one of the
6076.68s: most interesting one was there's one
6078.96s: that had like a lab on the inside and
6080.48s: he's like that's when I kind of like
6082.12s: left so I didn't really get to look into
6083.84s: it but it seemed like a lab like
6085.28s: genetics something he was very
6087.20s: interested in that that's fascinating
6089.28s: yeah well the unde UF phobia there's
6091.44s: actually a book called unde UFO Base by
6093.36s: Preston dennet and it's about the
6094.84s: Catalina you know Ridge area and uh you
6098.04s: know and then you have you know rumors
6099.88s: of you know off the coast of Mexico
6101.76s: Danny Shen even says I have coordinates
6103.64s: and so we were talking about taking a
6104.76s: boating trip out there there's ACH is a
6107.76s: yeah weapons testing facility that's
6109.16s: famous in the Bahamas you have tons of
6110.64s: UFO settings around Nassau and so and
6113.52s: West Coast they they both you know
6115.96s: they're everywhere and in Alaska like up
6117.72s: north right so yeah Alaska was one of
6119.60s: the first in the Indian Ocean there's
6121.32s: like there's a lot of sightings kind of
6122.96s: everywhere near big bodies of water deep
6125.44s: bodies of water y uh and he would even
6127.64s: say like if if approach this is the wild
6129.72s: thing is like he said when um if a ship
6133.28s: were to approach it it wouldn't like do
6136.52s: anything um but if you were to like turn
6140.36s: abruptly mhm um you're probably going to
6144.00s: get disintegrated into nothing W he's
6146.16s: like they have Tech that he's like first
6148.16s: of all it shits on anything electronic
6149.80s: in the vicinity he said we've tried to
6151.96s: hit it with nukes he's like we've gone
6153.56s: after it with submarines uh with jets
6155.72s: and whatever and only like and boats and
6158.32s: whatever and only the submarine came
6159.96s: back he's like we have audio of a pilot
6162.40s: going close to it we're talking to him
6164.20s: and all of a sudden it's just nothing Bo
6166.36s: just gone and never hear from him again
6168.00s: he's like they take you out and he's
6170.32s: like if you go after them they'll
6172.44s: usually just be evive it'll like just be
6175.12s: evasive it'll go away you won't see it
6176.80s: for weeks and then it'll come back um
6179.88s: unless you force it into a corner and
6181.52s: then he's like that's the last thing
6182.40s: you'll ever do I think there's a history
6184.36s: of like lost submarines in the Navy as
6186.76s: well and like you have the
6188.24s: US you have all these planes
6190.32s: disappearing and everything else and
6192.04s: immediately I think of NH uh MH370 yeah
6195.72s: where didn't the plane make like this
6197.96s: abrupt turn it did yeah the flight path
6199.92s: is very weird yeah so like that abrupt
6202.12s: turn maybe signaled whatever was in the
6204.48s: ocean there to be like whop threat
6206.52s: interesting gone so then maybe yeah who
6209.04s: know what do you think of that video
6210.24s: does that make the video maybe possibly
6212.00s: more potentially or maybe you know maybe
6214.56s: has nothing to do with it obviously but
6216.32s: I mean if it does I think it I think
6217.80s: it's just an interesting fact that it it
6219.48s: did have that sharp turn before it
6221.68s: disappeared yeah and he specifically
6223.60s: said he's like unless you're doing like
6225.08s: any sharp turn Maneuvers around it
6226.84s: you'll be fine he's like uh because
6229.48s: nothing like they're not going to take
6230.68s: out a boat of hippies you know they've
6232.68s: learned
6233.80s: uh to to know the difference almost like
6235.96s: an AI would that that case always
6238.20s: interested me too uh because you know
6240.64s: I'm not saying that I have no idea if
6242.04s: the video is real but um there's uh uh I
6245.64s: think there were these guys working at
6247.00s: free scale uh superconductors like on on
6250.08s: board the plane so that might Point
6251.80s: towards like this like interesting three
6253.00s: body problem thing where it's like
6254.24s: certain scientists are like extremely
6256.24s: valuable to them mhm I don't know yeah
6259.16s: interesting that could I
6261.80s: mean it's um it's a sensitive
6265.12s: one there's because there's so lot a lot
6267.20s: of opinions that so many civilian lives
6269.76s: involved you know so course yeah you
6271.20s: don't want you know respectful to the
6272.32s: fames it's it's it's tough It's a tough
6274.32s: to place to be like well no they're
6275.76s: probably still alive with aliens
6277.24s: somewhere like you know it's a weird
6279.32s: it's a weird thing to say but the
6280.84s: circumstances around it and the fact
6282.36s: that I mean the fact that we didn't find
6284.12s: anything doesn't surprise me yeah have
6286.84s: you ever seen how big the oceans are of
6288.44s: of course it's insane planes get lost
6290.24s: all the time yeah you can't find you
6291.84s: know you can even or all the time but
6294.24s: like yeah that I mean you have a hard
6296.48s: time finding a plane crashing in like
6297.84s: the Siberian Forest let alone a body of
6300.24s: water you know which is completely
6302.56s: undetectable like if it goes under
6304.72s: totally so but it is weird I don't know
6307.24s: it's also weird CNN covered that one for
6310.96s: three or four months there's a phone
6312.60s: call thing too what was the phone oh the
6314.92s: the prank phone call what are you talk
6316.52s: about phone calls afterwards where like
6317.88s: they would call and the phones would
6319.56s: still ring and then they would hang up
6321.52s: no way yeah they would call the people
6324.52s: yeah the family members would call them
6325.76s: and then stopped working after a while
6327.08s: and some people said oh that happens if
6328.56s: your phone dies or like there was like a
6330.36s: no that doesn't happen if your phone's
6331.88s: underwat like what or what yeah yeah
6334.96s: I've never heard that yeah some of the
6336.44s: families would call and it would ring
6338.68s: and then it would just like hang up
6339.92s: after instead of like going straight to
6341.16s: voicemail what yeah that's fascinating I
6344.00s: didn't know that it's another yeah they
6345.36s: were all panicking cuz that's what you
6346.44s: do you try to call so they would
6347.84s: non-stop call they would non-stop call
6350.16s: and it would get through and and it
6351.88s: would bring a few times and and then
6353.20s: eventually stop doing that but it' pick
6355.44s: up I'm not sure it pick up I think it
6357.32s: would just ring still weird still weird
6359.56s: yeah yeah yeah the phone is that's what
6361.36s: gave them hope they were like oh you
6362.96s: know right mhm oh wow yeah I don't know
6366.48s: man it's uh it's a it's a bizarre one
6368.80s: for sure yeah and seeing those videos
6371.04s: the multiple videos you know and that
6373.92s: was what was the big debunk there they
6376.52s: said that one frame matched exactly this
6378.96s: Frame from a video game right one of the
6381.80s: one of the Flash one the The Flash The
6384.80s: Flash around the craft Mick West said
6388.12s: West famous UFO debunker says that it
6390.52s: matched yeah some other frame from I
6392.16s: maybe a video game or yeah I think
6393.36s: Corridor crew did a video on that as
6395.60s: well and they said the same thing but
6397.80s: then like Ashton Forbes or whatever the
6400.60s: main kind of proponent of uh you know
6402.32s: this MH370 sort of mystery he believes
6404.76s: in that eh oh yeah yeah he definitely
6406.88s: does he came back and was like of course
6409.44s: they you know they look similar but
6410.68s: they're not it's not an exact match I
6412.24s: don't know you know it's it's impossible
6414.36s: to say and there are people who were
6415.68s: like you can't talk about this it's
6417.48s: going to ruin your reputation I'm like
6418.92s: I'm just I don't I don't know anything
6420.56s: I'm just saying I don't know you know
6422.12s: what do you yeah and who's going to like
6424.88s: what reputation are we talking about
6426.60s: here the one that says that I believe in
6429.16s: aliens like you know yeah yeah yeah you
6432.28s: know am I really trying to protect that
6434.96s: reputation that reputation cuz there
6436.80s: yeah there's some sort of you know
6438.12s: officially formal credential Club where
6440.40s: you can only you know this this is the
6441.84s: platform you have to accept
6443.92s: it's like we're all kind of in very
6445.40s: specul short gra tall graay mantis
6448.32s: that's cool reptilians I don't know dude
6450.04s: you sound insane right now well that's
6451.88s: what's funny about this whole topic is
6453.36s: people are like yeah you know I believe
6454.84s: you know seeing stuff in the sky that
6456.64s: breaks physics as we know it that's fine
6459.84s: but the thing coming in your bedroom and
6461.56s: putting a microchip in you I don't know
6463.48s: man that's a bridge too far and it's
6464.92s: like but you how are you accepting that
6466.96s: and then not what what is the bridge too
6468.84s: far you know you're saying those have no
6471.12s: Pilots yeah that's scary too yeah yeah
6473.88s: yeah so what are they right are these
6476.20s: sentient crafts yeah no it it creates a
6480.24s: Cascade of questions that the person's
6482.44s: usually not you know equ to answer and
6484.64s: then usually they want to cut it off at
6486.40s: a certain thing but that that cut off is
6488.44s: totally arbitrary it's not a it's not
6490.56s: based on like just proper open thinking
6493.28s: you know yeah not saying that you can't
6496.36s: have a similar Cascade where you down
6500.56s: probability like each next thing where
6502.92s: you say Close Encounter of the Third
6504.08s: Kind is maybe slightly low probability
6505.68s: and I think a lot of these deal with our
6507.04s: priors and maybe there's actually more
6508.44s: evidence for you know um Close Encounter
6510.96s: of the Third Kind because the people
6512.00s: come back with marks and like you know
6514.20s: and like they deal with this stuff often
6516.20s: in the exact same way they deal with any
6517.72s: sort of traumatic experience but um you
6520.68s: know anyways I don't know how you would
6522.16s: rank these thing probabil these things
6524.32s: probabilistically but I think it's fair
6526.00s: too say I think you know this is you
6528.24s: know 70% probable this is 30% you know
6530.92s: like I'd rank my own yeah lower
6532.92s: probability than the the nuclear guys or
6534.92s: whatever you know especially in Mass um
6538.20s: but do you do you think that you'll
6542.60s: ever
6544.72s: um be shown a
6548.48s: craft I would love that that would be a
6551.04s: dream be is that part of the trajectory
6554.64s: I I used to think okay maybe I'll poke
6557.08s: the bear enough that like I'll I'll you
6559.40s: know be be able to like see some cool
6561.36s: stuff yeah they'll be like now shut up
6562.76s: they'll be like shut up but we'll show
6564.08s: you a thing um I don't know man I like
6568.84s: the more I learn about the Legacy
6571.52s: program the more I think it's actually
6573.12s: kind of uh dark orientation towards the
6576.64s: entire subject like my thing is like
6579.04s: ontological truth take a shot um where
6582.28s: it's like I just want to uh understand
6584.40s: the you know uh architecture of reality
6587.00s: what is this like what's the soup we're
6588.64s: swimming in like who are we on like a
6591.12s: you know and is there is there something
6592.76s: you know higher than this um and and
6595.40s: then there's like the government is
6597.20s: interacting with like a little part of
6600.00s: that like the little tip of the iceberg
6601.72s: that you're seeing and it's doing so
6603.76s: often in a way to just create weaponry
6606.64s: and so um I think that's kind of a a
6609.40s: perversion of like you know that's not
6611.24s: that's not what I like am most
6612.92s: interested in sure but do you think if
6614.36s: you were to draw a line from the point
6617.72s: of your trajectory so far that that line
6621.48s: leads there that's a great question I
6624.80s: don't know I mean my my life's been so
6626.40s: unpredictable thus far that it's just
6628.60s: hard to say where where it goes and like
6631.52s: uh if invited to see a craft I would say
6634.40s: yes I wouldn't say no if it meant if it
6637.44s: meant you had to lie about seeing that
6639.36s: craft would you would you agree if it
6641.12s: meant I had to lie just about seeing
6643.52s: that craft yeah probably probably not
6647.20s: lying but omitting it or like skirting
6649.44s: around it if if it meant uh having to do
6652.24s: anything as far as altering my content
6654.88s: or like what I'm putting out like no no
6657.08s: but like yeah I I omit stuff all the
6659.40s: time say I would just say I can't say or
6661.60s: you know whatever you know maybe I can't
6663.76s: say the hermeneutic around I can't say
6665.52s: now is like you're saying that you you
6667.36s: saw the thing or whatever so I'd have to
6669.28s: figure that out and think about that but
6671.00s: like if if it's completely harmless from
6674.08s: a like the content that I'm putting out
6675.96s: perspective like I I want to see a craft
6678.56s: what what about you how would you answer
6680.00s: that well before we get to me I still
6682.80s: want to ask you these questions yeah
6684.16s: yeah me yeah
6686.32s: um do you do you believe David grush saw
6689.00s: a
6690.24s: craft uh no I don't I don't think he's
6692.64s: seen a craft do you believe how put off
6694.44s: seen a
6695.88s: craft that's interesting maybe I don't
6699.44s: know but maybe yeah you know that guy
6702.60s: just uh you know he's got his uh he's
6705.12s: he's he's brilliant he's really
6706.96s: brilliant and he's a polymath and he's
6708.56s: kind of this renaissance man and he pops
6710.92s: up everywhere on this topic in like very
6713.32s: deep circle and he even had like this I
6715.72s: don't know if it was a limited hangout
6717.16s: or what but it was this Advanced
6718.48s: theoretical physics group with Oki
6720.16s: Shannon and John Alexander and all these
6722.28s: guys and like I have some reason to
6724.32s: believe John Alexander was you know
6726.60s: pretty deep on the inside with this
6728.64s: stuff and so those two interacting for
6731.32s: that long like and then put off just
6734.00s: being as smart as he is yeah on all
6736.60s: these different vectors Consciousness
6738.12s: but also you know uh these different
6740.52s: models of like you know electrodynamic
6742.88s: and stuffff uh yeah maybe I don't know
6745.76s: then do you do you think that you've
6748.16s: ever interviewed someone who you can
6751.00s: confidently
6753.00s: say has been inside a
6756.84s: UFO oh I can confidently say they've
6759.72s: been inside of a UFO yeah you've You'
6762.80s: you've interviewed people who said
6764.12s: they've been inside via abduction yeah
6767.16s: yeah yeah yeah sure yeah yeah like Mario
6768.80s: Woods sure yeah or Whitley let's take
6772.60s: those those encounters away in a
6774.92s: government context correct you have a
6776.80s: craft you open the hatch and you walk in
6779.20s: as like a government employee or like
6781.12s: Aerospace employee without naming this
6782.96s: person do you think yes or no that
6784.92s: you've spoken to someone who is possibly
6786.84s: or has probably been in one of these
6788.88s: crafts that's such a good
6791.60s: question I don't think
6796.32s: so maybe okay yeah I just thought of
6800.72s: somebody who maybe yeah yeah yeah that's
6803.32s: interesting yeah yeah
6806.36s: yeah it it it gets it gets to a
6808.84s: territory that's
6810.92s: um
6813.00s: that's weird to dance
6815.68s: around uh I think because you know both
6819.32s: of us both of us want to know we're both
6822.48s: and and you know everybody watching this
6824.36s: far into the podcast wants to know
6826.64s: comfortably say or you know they're just
6829.32s: trying to get us to shut up there's two
6831.24s: types of people watching this right now
6832.48s: now that are paying very close
6834.68s: attention um but in in that in that
6837.92s: context of of wanting to know and and
6840.64s: being the people that we are and it's
6842.84s: kind of like we're to them to people
6844.64s: watching a lot of them at the at the
6846.16s: Forefront of this of of of trying to get
6848.48s: this out even though we don't
6849.44s: necessarily see ourselves like that
6850.88s: sometimes we're kind of just like I'm
6851.84s: reporting on things that I you know
6853.52s: people I talk to or whatever but
6856.28s: inevitably we're getting closer and
6859.00s: closer and cl we're not getting further
6860.60s: I don't think I agree um so I I think
6863.20s: there is a trajectory there where we
6865.88s: make we end up seeing something
6868.04s: eventually yeah whether it's nhi yeah or
6872.96s: whether it's um you know craft or Tech
6877.36s: uh derived from this let's do it man do
6880.48s: you are you prepared for
6882.56s: that I would love to see something I
6885.36s: think I am I think I'm very open-minded
6888.48s: and I'm pretty grounded and I'd love I'd
6891.08s: love to see something I mean as far as
6893.28s: trajectory goes I think it'd be really
6896.12s: cool on this topic to do real sense
6899.60s: making or like thinking about
6901.68s: ontological truth with respect to what
6904.36s: we're dealing with instead of just
6905.92s: quickly running into like you know how
6907.64s: do we instrumentalize it to like you
6909.40s: know for defense purposes or whatever
6911.28s: thinking about it from that perspective
6913.48s: thinking about the tech from uh civil
6916.36s: infrastructure and like updating our you
6918.40s: know kind of urban living environments
6920.04s: and making them like these beautiful
6921.68s: kind of places that like are in harmony
6924.28s: with with the Earth or whatever and then
6926.24s: also making people's lives more
6928.08s: meaningful through like the the most
6929.84s: number one and two yeah and if if uh I
6933.36s: think if if we could do something like
6934.84s: that that would be epic and then if you
6936.36s: had top cover from UFO Legacy programs
6940.68s: where if they if you find something
6942.88s: that's dual use it gets worked in or
6946.40s: whatever like I'd be okay with that but
6949.52s: as far as my orientation towards you
6951.76s: know like what I want to be spending
6953.24s: time on it feels sort of wrong to uh I
6957.60s: don't know look at like the sort of the
6959.40s: celestial or like you know this really
6961.20s: you know interesting um ontologically
6964.24s: you know fascinating uh phenomena and
6966.44s: then your immediate instinct is like
6969.96s: weaponize you know yeah have you played
6973.32s: out the scenario of like seeing a thing
6976.64s: yeah of like being like shown uh or
6980.80s: meeting huh
6985.52s: I've played out the meeting scenario but
6987.44s: I've I've always thought that that would
6988.76s: happen in a context that you know didn't
6991.04s: come through like official government
6992.60s: channels yeah um thought I've thought of
6995.76s: that sure that what does that look
6997.76s: like I don't know I mean I the way I
7001.80s: think about it is like it's you're
7003.60s: probably in some sort of you know
7005.64s: there's always missing time right Al
7007.24s: State altered state and it's like that I
7010.48s: don't know they sort of like descend
7011.96s: upon on you and uh I don't I I don't I
7016.08s: don't really know I think it's a really
7017.52s: hard
7018.40s: to answer uh scenario do you ever
7022.44s: because I I often try to imagine what I
7025.08s: would
7025.80s: feel looking at that what do you would
7028.64s: you would you freak out or would you be
7031.04s: cool or um when I think hard on it and I
7035.44s: really um imagine a face to face yeah
7039.40s: with something
7040.80s: unfamiliar no
7042.80s: there's this knowing of like they they
7045.44s: they're just like they know more than me
7047.60s: and like they they have complete
7050.16s: complete dominance if they wish you know
7052.48s: this this whole I I think as a human
7055.32s: being we've never felt that before yeah
7058.16s: you know yeah other than maybe if
7059.84s: somebody has a gun to your head y you
7062.00s: don't feel that type of
7063.92s: inferiority sure and I think that
7066.92s: would um I would have to get past that
7070.76s: somehow
7072.56s: maybe that maybe that's on them to
7074.68s: reassure me but I think that like I
7077.48s: often think of that I often think on how
7079.12s: that would inhibit my interaction yeah
7082.04s: um because I'm I'm I'm not sure I had
7084.56s: any I'd have anything to offer yeah that
7087.88s: conversation yeah and so I'd be at a
7091.32s: loss for words I wouldn't know where to
7093.16s: begin maybe the conversation wouldn't be
7095.52s: so that you could offer them something
7097.08s: maybe it would be them their ability to
7099.36s: help you or something sure but yeah I
7102.80s: yeah I don't know I'm also strange to
7104.52s: think about it would it's extremely
7106.56s: strange to think about I think it would
7108.20s: have it's often I think it's somehow an
7110.48s: emanation or reflection of your state
7113.28s: and that that's why you know I think
7114.88s: this these modern UFO World talks a lot
7117.64s: about like summoning and like that feels
7119.52s: like very dangerous and weird to me
7121.84s: honestly um so you know I think you'd
7124.20s: have to be in like a very good kind of
7125.84s: peak energy State and it would have to
7128.44s: feel it would have to feel it's like
7130.60s: that you know uh it happen when you stop
7133.16s: looking for it you know and and then
7135.12s: that that feels like more meaningful
7136.76s: than the like could you imagine doing um
7140.40s: kind of what the story that Danny told
7142.52s: about you know seeing this jrod or
7145.64s: whatever sat across from you at a table
7148.48s: much like this in a room much like this
7150.64s: with similar lighting staring at a being
7153.76s: with the eyes wrapping around its head
7156.24s: you know large head and knowing that it
7159.56s: can read your mind like
7162.72s: how would you would you be comfortable
7165.24s: there uh if it's in a like a a skiff or
7169.12s: something and you're like doing some
7170.96s: formal government job no I'd be freaked
7172.96s: out yeah like that's kind of
7174.88s: traumatizing um again I think if it
7178.08s: happens in some sort of weirdly
7179.68s: serendipitous sort of gentle way or
7182.20s: something States yeah between states and
7185.76s: yeah I I think I think in in the
7187.52s: government context I could see that
7188.80s: being extremely traumatizing I told you
7190.80s: this story uh yesterday last night but
7194.16s: um you know we were talking about Danny
7195.68s: shean telling the story of aliens you
7198.20s: know possibly you know an S4 at Area 51
7202.64s: and you know one of them being
7203.76s: interviewed and you know this this
7206.08s: witness what's the witness's name uh
7208.04s: Oscar wolf Oscar wolf reporting you know
7210.56s: seeing you know the interview and um I
7214.60s: have uh these really good friends
7216.20s: Garrett Nicole mcamera and uh they are
7219.08s: uh these legendary big wave Surfers
7222.00s: Garrett broke the world record for the
7223.96s: the biggest wave ever surfed in the
7225.40s: world at nazer Portugal and they have a
7227.80s: a show on HBO it's an amazing show
7229.24s: called The 100 foot wave and they were
7231.00s: at lunch in Vegas with a buddy and uh
7234.92s: their friend uh brought another friend
7237.28s: who's a longtime kind of like Aerospace
7239.88s: uh you know employee or whatever and uh
7242.56s: he was at lunch and he looked a little
7244.16s: sort of traumatized and they get into it
7246.16s: and they find out that this guy had been
7248.40s: uh an employee at Area 51 and I think
7251.32s: they're joking about CU they just know
7252.96s: the lore they're like you know so like
7254.80s: have you seen any aliens and he kind of
7256.84s: goes white in the face apparently he had
7259.12s: been taken down again also underground
7262.56s: so similar to the Oscar wolf story and
7265.92s: seeing a reptilian
7268.16s: being uh in custody like somehow like
7271.72s: like like chained up and uh and that the
7275.56s: thing seem to speak to him like
7277.56s: telepathically and he freaked out and
7279.60s: ran and has been I think somewhat trauma
7282.08s: ized ever since on like medical leave I
7284.52s: think on Med yeah on medical leave yeah
7286.56s: I I I don't know the exact I don't want
7288.92s: to get it wrong but yeah and I know them
7291.68s: I know them very well they're like
7293.92s: really close Beyond trustworthy and they
7297.04s: didn't tell this to me to like tell this
7299.36s: story like they don't need the fame or
7300.80s: notori like I mean he's a legend and
7303.20s: she's amazing I love her and so there's
7305.44s: just there's no ulterior motive there
7307.04s: yeah that's they're just relaying the
7308.24s: information that this person said yeah
7310.12s: it's crazy it is crazy also Danny told
7313.20s: me about this other story about somebody
7315.36s: who is I guess maybe translating calls
7318.52s: I'm G to butcher this but he was or
7321.44s: transcribing calls or something and
7323.88s: overheard them say uh at S4 that the
7327.96s: Mantis people didn't want any humans in
7329.56s: the room wow yeah interesting and I was
7334.00s: like H that's that's two weird things
7336.04s: there there's you said the Mantis people
7338.12s: and then you said they don't like us wow
7341.00s: you know what I mean like like were
7342.08s: inferior they don't want to well the
7344.60s: other interesting possible spin on this
7347.72s: is like you have Harold malrin who is
7350.88s: you know presidential adviser to JFK LBJ
7354.32s: Nixon and Ford saying that he was
7356.88s: briefed on other world Technologies by
7358.80s: Richard Bissell who we know is the
7360.72s: deputy director of the CIA and founded
7363.44s: Area
7364.32s: 51 and so that's like the founding of
7367.60s: Area 51 is dealing with other world
7370.12s: techn this is early on this was like
7371.60s: early early 60s so and like I think the
7373.32s: area 51 was founded in the 50s so like
7376.28s: my guess is aam's Razer that like otherw
7379.00s: World Technologies was like part of the
7381.12s: founding of Area 51 it wasn't like eight
7383.24s: years in now we have other world
7384.76s: technology we're incorporating it Area
7386.64s: 51 they needed it should be hidden and
7389.36s: and before Area 51 was formed to do U2
7393.16s: spy plane testing it was an atomic test
7395.44s: range and we know where UFOs show up
7398.12s: right so like the uh Nevada Test Site is
7401.92s: you know I think not just
7403.36s: serendipitously I think very
7405.08s: deliberately created around around this
7407.32s: sort of stuff and then you have to ask
7408.96s: the ontological question like is there a
7411.56s: maybe spa space program or you know
7414.72s: Aerospace program where the aliens are
7417.36s: working with the humans side by side and
7420.44s: um I had an interesting conversation
7421.92s: with Hal put off where he sort of hinted
7424.36s: at something like that being possible
7426.28s: which is always his sort of thing where
7428.44s: like it's always you know he'll always
7429.88s: can't confirm or deny look at this open
7432.04s: paper take a look tell me what you think
7433.80s: you know um so interesting isn't it yeah
7436.20s: yeah yeah yeah exactly so you know again
7439.52s: I don't know but like the story The only
7443.36s: Rich do and and and the whole Phil
7445.16s: Schneider and like there's like all the
7447.88s: stories about them you know working
7450.24s: alongside you know for these horrible
7452.36s: things totally and the only part of the
7454.56s: story that the mcnamer is told um which
7458.00s: again I fully believe they're relaying
7460.00s: of this but that like doesn't sit well
7462.24s: with me is uh the guy seeing the alien
7465.00s: chained up like presumably I mean maybe
7467.68s: that some of these are like Avatar
7469.20s: Avatar biological drones and it actually
7471.44s: is easy to sort of you know chain them
7473.24s: or you know whatever but to the extent
7475.48s: that we've had any real alien
7477.28s: interaction you know maybe you you you
7480.16s: you'd partner with them you wouldn't
7481.56s: like you know take them into custody or
7483.92s: whatever yeah I mean unless you know
7487.08s: maybe that one misbehaved or they had
7489.32s: some type of strife or you know what
7491.80s: mean like there's there there are those
7493.12s: stories sure where you know you were not
7495.52s: allowed was it Phil Schneider said you
7496.92s: weren't allowed to bring a gun into like
7499.08s: the certain level whatever it was there
7500.76s: was like these I don't know how many
7502.04s: levels underground but like in the lower
7504.20s: ones they the ETS there did not want you
7506.48s: to bring a gun in there and then one of
7508.52s: like the the lower level guys he was
7510.60s: there and he had a gun on him because he
7512.56s: forgot or whatever and like stressed
7514.28s: them out and like it stressed him out
7515.92s: but he saw them like sort of like get
7517.76s: stressed out so he pulled his gun out
7519.28s: and it was like they killed a bunch of
7520.92s: people and it was like
7523.04s: this whole thing but like you know it
7525.76s: yeah we we say this we say this just
7529.08s: just just because it makes for
7530.52s: interesting conversation but at no point
7533.32s: am I sold on any of these things but
7535.16s: much like you said near the beginning of
7536.56s: the interview or the podcast was you
7539.80s: know let's low conviction let's bring
7542.88s: all this on the ground floor yeah keep
7545.08s: it there yeah you know what I mean play
7546.96s: around with it and see if we can find
7548.04s: connections but definitely don't uh you
7550.52s: know don't take it to the bank totally
7552.64s: you I think to make progress in this
7555.76s: field you have to presume a baseline of
7559.92s: like this thing the thing probably
7561.44s: exists and like you know make a few
7563.16s: Baseline assumptions and then speculate
7565.68s: and you have to be fully aware that like
7567.72s: the whole thing might collapse at a
7569.20s: certain point because you might have
7570.08s: taken like the wrong Branch but I think
7572.96s: to make to make progress you have to
7574.72s: sort of su suspend certain disbelief you
7577.04s: have to say Okay past a certain amount
7578.68s: of probability let's know that still
7581.96s: probabilistic but let's take it as a
7584.20s: prior in our further speculation yeah
7587.44s: yeah aam's aam's Razer doesn't really
7589.20s: apply the UFO landscape no when when
7592.92s: you're looking for you know new
7594.40s: information absolutely but I think the
7598.04s: The Fringe is where the sort of future
7600.56s: comes from yeah and so it's
7602.40s: systematically sort of you know panning
7603.96s: for gold and the weird [ __ ] is like
7606.24s: that's where that's where the good stuff
7607.60s: comes yeah and I found out like even
7608.96s: hanging with you like yesterday and
7610.40s: today that that your you know your drive
7614.16s: and your passion for Zero Point
7618.00s: Energy gravitational more more on the
7621.28s: the gravitational stuff um the the
7624.32s: manipulation of gravity and and what you
7626.32s: know what the effects of that are on
7627.72s: time and and whatever like that's your
7630.40s: interest and I found it that like my
7633.96s: equal interest lies in in the stories of
7637.04s: yeah of these beings I'm just like
7639.44s: completely obsessed with them I have all
7640.92s: these books with like these where they
7642.56s: meet these beings and I'm just I'm so
7645.48s: I'm so so interested as much as you're
7647.84s: it just made me so happy that we share
7651.00s: common interests yeah um that aren't
7654.68s: identical but that are complimentary
7658.16s: totally uh which is really cool I think
7660.04s: it's awesome man and like I think yeah
7662.96s: you have the invisible college right you
7664.80s: know it's just actually this Robert Bole
7667.12s: term hearkening back to like you know
7669.04s: 16th century like the pre-enlightenment
7671.52s: and I I I take it now in the modern
7673.84s: context and like the jacqu Vala context
7676.80s: almost to mean like people who are like
7678.44s: called to this stuff from some I don't
7681.72s: know primordial like you know this just
7683.76s: feels like it's part of the you know my
7685.72s: my life's Mission or whatever and I love
7687.84s: the fact that everybody's pulled to
7689.28s: different aspects to it you're pulled to
7691.64s: getting to know the culture of you know
7694.20s: the the beings themselves you have you
7696.68s: know UAP gerb who's like uh as good as
7699.84s: anybody I know when it comes to tracking
7701.84s: Legacy progam activities and then yeah I
7705.16s: try to sort of sense make on you know or
7708.20s: you know figure out what's going but I
7709.48s: also have very interest you know deep
7711.04s: interest in the the the gravity and Time
7713.16s: stuff yeah the theoretics of it you're
7715.68s: you're just you're just so I love I love
7718.84s: hearing your brain um you know when it
7721.76s: comes to this sub especially when you
7722.84s: get a new piece of information ah you
7725.28s: you can see I I I hear you sometimes
7730.08s: like when you hear a new piece of
7731.48s: information you might not get this cuz
7732.88s: he maybe edits this out of his own
7734.28s: videos but you go uh-huh mhm yeah uh-huh
7739.32s: yeah and no one's saying anything and
7741.16s: that's just you making connections in
7743.36s: your head and you're like mhm yeah yep
7747.32s: yeah and you can like you're you're
7748.80s: externalizing these like actual
7750.60s: connections these like these neurons
7752.88s: that are clicking together in your brain
7754.40s: it's fascinating to see it's wonderful
7756.36s: funny I'd probably be doing that the
7757.76s: entire time and not even speaking if I
7760.92s: didn't have like a a podcast you know
7763.60s: but then and then you have to like and
7765.32s: the thing I sometimes struggle with is
7766.72s: like you have to like have this cannon
7768.28s: in your head of like these different
7770.44s: events and sometimes I'm like I don't
7772.76s: even care about the specifics of a
7775.24s: single event I care about how they kind
7777.12s: of like uh collaborate or comport with
7780.44s: each other and like how you can build
7782.16s: like a working model and then sometimes
7784.64s: I'm like I'll do a podcast and I'm like
7787.16s: I got to study up on these cases and I'm
7789.04s: like I don't the details are like you
7791.48s: know obviously they're extremely
7793.16s: important to get right at a certain
7795.80s: point and then when you but just to make
7798.12s: the connections or whatever for for me
7800.28s: and then I think there are great you
7802.20s: know it's like en encyclopedias of the
7804.88s: actual like stories themselves and like
7806.32s: that has tremendous value too but uh
7808.88s: yeah that's funny that you said I like
7811.16s: that I can see you in real time making
7813.08s: amazing connections it's fun to see it's
7815.72s: fun to watch your brain function well I
7817.36s: hope they're uh I hope they're real
7818.52s: connections and I hope we make uh we
7820.20s: make some real progress I think we are I
7821.72s: think we're slow and steady yeah and we
7824.16s: have some interesting projects on the
7825.72s: horizon oh yeah which uh which we got a
7828.72s: call after this to hop on a meeting dude
7830.96s: I'm so psyched for that and that's not
7833.00s: only you know we're both interested in
7835.08s: this particular story but I think it
7838.20s: shows our different skill sets too
7840.00s: because like you're just so much better
7842.76s: at like the like production like movie
7845.12s: making aspect of all of this than I am
7847.96s: um and then you know yeah I think I can
7849.84s: add some like you know deep research
7851.60s: chops and stuff it's going to be great
7854.08s: definitely and this will be you know you
7856.28s: you've told me as well you've confided
7857.80s: that like you know YouTube for you is
7861.44s: you know a means to to to getting to the
7864.72s: truth right you use YouTube as that for
7867.32s: you to like give yourself an audience
7868.80s: that it allows you to have these
7869.84s: conversations with other people so you
7871.08s: can get closer to the truth totally and
7874.08s: um I don't know I I I just think I just
7876.84s: think
7878.56s: it's I just think it's really cool what
7881.76s: it is you're doing and your path and how
7885.44s: much love and actual genuine curiosity
7889.08s: human curiosity that you have and you
7891.52s: represent a lot of people you represent
7893.08s: a lot of people who are curious and
7894.28s: that's I think why people um gravitate
7897.32s: towards your content because they
7899.20s: recognize their own curiosity through
7902.76s: your absolute amazing breadth of
7905.28s: knowledge as well and and and you you
7907.52s: represent them you represent them but on
7909.28s: a scale that that a lot of us can't you
7911.76s: know get to we can't I don't see myself
7914.92s: you know as being that knowledgeable
7916.44s: ever on these things but I'm glad that
7918.76s: someone that I trust does well that
7921.84s: that's so nice you to say I mean I a I
7924.08s: think I'm standing on the shoulders of
7926.04s: giants and people like you know Stanton
7929.16s: fredman and even on the you know
7930.68s: investigative reporting side James Fox
7932.76s: and Ross col like those guys are and
7934.48s: they've been doing it for decades and so
7935.92s: it's like very easy for me to like come
7938.04s: in now and it's like a popular topic so
7940.00s: I feel very grateful there
7941.96s: and then uh yeah I mean like I said I
7945.68s: just I think uh your storytelling
7948.84s: ability and and production and stuff
7950.80s: like I think I think my on on those
7953.20s: vectors I pale in comparison to you and
7954.96s: so it's just beautiful to play any part
7957.16s: in this and um I think there are
7959.72s: different stages of the funnel as far as
7962.16s: like people's interest in the thing I I
7964.28s: truly think uh your show and I've I've
7967.60s: told you this point blank before I think
7969.12s: it's going to be like the biggest show
7970.88s: on the top as far as surface area it's
7972.48s: going to introduce so many people to it
7974.88s: and that's of you know uh indispensable
7978.24s: value as well so I appreciate the kind
7980.16s: words and I appreciate you saying that
7981.76s: and if it gets more people interested
7983.40s: and if it gets more people to that next
7985.16s: level you know of Interest I think then
7988.00s: that's good you know we've talked about
7989.28s: this before but you know you have the Y
7990.84s: files who's covering that broad yeah
7993.20s: who's great by the way I think he's
7994.96s: awesome absolutely because he's really
7996.56s: getting a lot of people into the topic
7998.32s: much more than you know we could combin
8001.44s: you know what I mean um and then as that
8003.48s: pyramid gets a little bit narrower in
8005.80s: terms of people's interest and and Niche
8008.36s: interest to the topic um you know we're
8011.12s: kind of I feel like we're all kind of
8013.40s: guiding that audience to ultimately you
8017.08s: know whatever is on the peak of that
8019.12s: pyramid yes um collectively like we're
8021.44s: all doing our part Rising tide raises
8023.16s: All Ships you know F fully agree and I
8026.00s: think it's a yeah it's it's just a
8028.20s: beautiful thing and like no nobody
8030.12s: should kind of want it's like it's kind
8031.72s: like Lord of the Rings cuz you're you're
8033.52s: you're really you're going for like
8035.12s: sacred truth so you should never want to
8037.48s: be like the person to like put the ring
8039.36s: on you know you want like this kind of
8041.72s: collegial like you know Consortium to to
8045.20s: you know kind of say like nobody should
8046.60s: put the ring up but let yeah may we
8048.08s: figure it out make some progress who's
8049.56s: who's euphy's Gollum all right oh that's
8051.72s: hilarious I can think of a few man but
8053.72s: I'm not going to say any names yeah
8055.64s: there yeah are we talking about
8057.04s: physically or or um okay we're gonna
8059.84s: we're going to go to
8061.64s: the uh intern questions if you guys want
8064.28s: to become an intern by the way it's five
8065.52s: bucks a month you get all sorts of extra
8067.44s: content and one of the extra perks is um
8070.76s: I pick three questions from the interns
8072.44s: that we get to ask to our lovely guests
8074.72s: so uh I've curated these for you today
8078.36s: cool and
8080.40s: uh here we go here's the first one and I
8084.36s: don't know who this but I'm going to
8085.44s: have to apologize I have to go look at
8087.04s: because there only 132 characters on
8089.32s: this thing so sometimes no worries yeah
8091.20s: they get cut a little bit but all good
8093.96s: so I'll read it behind oh I had to yep I
8095.92s: turn on that camera
8099.64s: okay this is an intense question yeah
8103.72s: you find out you have three days left to
8105.92s: live you're in perfect health walk us
8108.24s: through your last 72 hours oh here we go
8111.72s: airons
8113.72s: airons all right hitting me hard airons
8117.28s: I don't know you know I think spend it
8119.64s: with my family for sure like I just be
8122.00s: with the people I'm closest with and
8123.80s: then I try to get my friends to come and
8125.44s: just hang out and reminisce I mean I
8127.12s: don't know what I mean the most
8128.28s: important thing in life is like your
8129.92s: relationships I think so that's I think
8132.76s: what I would do and that sounds kind of
8134.40s: lame but like I probably wouldn't be
8136.60s: like working out and I wouldn't I
8139.92s: wouldn't do some like you know Hail Mary
8143.12s: like go to Japan and hi M fi good roller
8146.64s: coast that feels like nihilistic I think
8148.48s: it's like just you know be with the
8150.52s: people love the most yep great answer
8152.76s: and I agree no it's that's the perfect
8154.60s: answer the only answer I I think so too
8156.96s: yeah right I think a younger me would
8159.00s: have said well I got a bucket list of
8160.88s: like things to accomplish you know I
8162.68s: wanted to road trip here or go
8164.32s: paragliding or whatever and yeah I think
8166.56s: a younger me would have denied the
8167.88s: reality I would have said create some
8169.88s: you know magic pill that you know
8171.68s: allowed me to survive and you know I
8173.48s: don't know uh yeah that's a deep
8176.32s: question definitely deep uh next here
8181.92s: this is a good one
8183.32s: too Obi-Wan
8186.16s: Shinobi
8192.96s: nice from everyone you've ever
8195.32s: interviewed who shook your epistemology
8198.04s: the most and how slash why oh wow it's
8201.68s: such a good question it's the
8204.16s: experiencers it's people like uh Mike
8208.12s: Masters who had you know very strange
8211.24s: interesting experience at a conference
8213.08s: in Arizona where he was like downloaded
8215.68s: information from what he thought were
8217.48s: people from the future and one of these
8219.32s: people is like a person who like has a
8222.88s: social security number like is a person
8224.48s: with like a name and like downloaded the
8226.96s: information into it so that like that
8228.48s: was fascinating because I was like wait
8230.72s: so you thought you thought you know it's
8232.28s: all like you're you're experiencing kind
8233.76s: of an abduction like experience but it
8235.52s: was from another person and that guy is
8237.48s: like yeah I don't know what goes on with
8238.80s: my brain sometimes so that was
8241.04s: fascinating because it wasn't just like
8242.56s: it was like we're avatars of some higher
8244.68s: stuff and like occasionally in his case
8247.20s: something takes over so that was
8248.96s: fascinating Whitley streber where it's
8251.28s: just like dude like he has he thinks he
8253.32s: has like a hybrid child that chain
8255.88s: smokes that occasionally like goes would
8257.96s: go into his house with his wife and like
8259.88s: sleep on the couch and stuff so I'm like
8262.12s: that stuff like that where I'm like I
8263.04s: don't know what to make of it and then
8264.08s: like he has an implant in his ear and
8265.60s: like I felt the implant the implant
8267.12s: feels very strange but I have no idea
8269.32s: again what to make of that mhm so that
8271.20s: that's next level and then Mario Woods
8273.04s: as well um who was 1977 Ellsworth Air
8275.80s: Force Base uh and you know wakes up 9
8279.00s: miles away from he sees a UFO wakes up n
8281.32s: nine miles away uh from the base and uh
8285.44s: also just it's just such the amount of
8287.88s: detail he has is remarkable of like this
8290.64s: sort of beehive of little Grays like
8294.04s: doing uh you know all sorts of little
8295.88s: tasks in the craft and then like
8297.80s: engaging in this sort of biomedical
8299.36s: experiment on him and then this kind of
8301.04s: tall gray that's in charge overseeing
8302.96s: the whole operation and uh and then him
8305.36s: having marks on his body you know it's
8307.68s: it's always the experiencers that I
8309.44s: think mess me up the most yeah yeah and
8312.60s: I I mean that's that's been my pretty
8316.04s: much what's been happening to me as well
8317.68s: every time I read of a new experience
8320.16s: yeah or I I see an interview and you
8322.28s: know you get to look in their eyes or
8323.64s: even meet them in person even better
8325.92s: it's to me holds so much more weight
8328.48s: yeah than a redacted file or or or
8331.56s: whatever this is like oh it's a human
8333.04s: being that yeah you that was changed due
8335.56s: to an event and often they're just like
8337.20s: such good people they hold like uh uh
8341.28s: Mario had his Q clearance for 20 years
8343.20s: after that he was like working at Sandy
8344.60s: and National Labs like do you think if
8346.76s: the government didn't think this was a
8348.96s: normal thing to happen which it is they
8351.92s: would let a guy if this was a unique
8353.88s: experience and he's saying that little
8355.88s: gra implanted a thing in him do you
8358.64s: think that they wouldn't fire the guy
8360.00s: from like you know the highest doe clear
8362.96s: thing you know so that or Mike Masters
8365.88s: who's a professor to this day at at
8367.96s: Montana Tech um or you know and they
8370.32s: kind of like support a lot of the stuff
8371.68s: that he's doing they they love it um you
8374.80s: know so I I think I think there's that's
8376.52s: always extremely interesting as well Mak
8378.16s: more credible makes him really more
8379.48s: credible where uh the experience is
8382.68s: completely you know uh isolated from
8385.88s: like the rest of their life they're just
8387.08s: like these high agency like good people
8389.12s: they're really good people they just
8390.20s: don't seem like liars at all and yeah I
8393.24s: know Mario Woods made no made no money
8395.40s: off of this stuff he's not like a UFO
8397.32s: per you know he just he's he just wants
8399.48s: to get the story out and he's such a
8401.76s: nice guy like all these people are very
8403.16s: nice good people you go to lunch with
8405.64s: them and hang out with them and it's
8407.28s: like I know you're not
8409.80s: lying it's a hard pillow to swallow man
8412.48s: it is when you think about all that
8413.64s: stuff because like partially you know we
8415.84s: talked a little bit about this yesterday
8417.16s: where like I'll find out that oh they
8419.16s: discovered a new exoplanet or that a
8421.16s: bacteria was found on one of the moons
8422.68s: of one of the planets yeah right you
8424.72s: I'll get partially a little excited and
8426.36s: I'll be like oh cool and wait wait wait
8428.72s: a minute yeah yeah yeah yeah what yeah
8431.12s: yeah people get people are getting
8432.16s: abducted well it's so funny there're
8434.36s: like all these narratives of disclosure
8435.88s: and like what's really in Vogue right
8437.28s: now is like the Mars like there was Life
8438.84s: on Mars a million years ago and so it's
8441.20s: like that is it's amazing but it's also
8443.44s: like you have stuff going on on Earth
8445.36s: right now and uh but I think it's more
8447.48s: palatable so I don't think it's
8448.84s: valueless the fact that with the thing
8451.60s: you have like Xenon 129 and argon 40
8454.48s: which only seem to show up around
8455.76s: nuclear blasts yeah and then you have
8458.60s: water crevices all over Mars which I
8461.24s: think even conventional astronomers
8462.76s: would say that it probably had a
8463.84s: biosphere at some point and a
8465.40s: magnetosphere that maybe it was stripped
8467.20s: from you know it was stripped right um
8469.88s: and uh and then you have alh84001
8472.44s: which was this asteroid found in
8474.80s: Antarctica that Clinton made an
8476.32s: announcement on because it had um you
8479.64s: know a a it had uh um uh carbon it had
8483.52s: life it had it had fossilized bacteria
8486.04s: polycyclic hydrocarbons on it um and
8489.16s: again I don't think anybody would argue
8490.52s: with with that finding yeah um so you
8492.64s: have this Mosaic of like you know and
8494.36s: then you have you know then you have to
8495.80s: go in the slightly low lower probability
8498.00s: of Joseph mcmonagle who's our like
8499.40s: number one remote viewer who definitely
8500.84s: saved our ass the US I mean in in
8503.52s: geopolitical situations you know
8505.16s: elsewhere saying that a he was you know
8507.60s: he was tasked with seeing some you know
8509.48s: looking at Mars believe years ago and he
8511.12s: sees this pyramid and beings that were
8513.84s: like twice the size of humans and you
8516.40s: have to ask why they even asked him to
8518.24s: look at a million like did they have
8520.80s: that was do or Dia or yeah um it Dia I
8524.48s: think it was Dia and you had um you have
8527.24s: this nuclear scientist that works at um
8529.68s: has worked at Lawrence Livermore in
8531.28s: Sandia who I just had on my podcast
8533.40s: named John brandenberg he a PhD super
8536.32s: smart and um he was looking at all this
8539.04s: Mars stuff along with Rich Rich hogland
8541.08s: who's a little more controversial and he
8543.12s: was he was looking at it from the you
8544.92s: know the existence of these Isotopes you
8547.16s: know that that shouldn't exist without
8548.68s: you know the nuclear blast or whatever
8551.40s: um and there are artificial structures
8552.68s: as well you tweeted one that Joe Rogan
8554.32s: retweeted that's like you know been
8555.96s: verified at the highest levels that you
8557.96s: know um and he said Brandenburg said
8560.56s: that Carl Sean called him and he's like
8563.24s: John what why are you causing so much
8564.76s: trouble like what's up man and uh so I
8568.04s: don't know I think that's it's all it's
8569.56s: very fascinating and extremely
8571.44s: fascinating and I don't know if that you
8573.00s: know I on one level maybe it's like way
8574.92s: less interesting than like abductions
8576.48s: happening on Earth but it's if there's
8578.84s: like a whole subset of humanity that's
8580.80s: just not going to believe the data set
8583.04s: that you have here no matter what no
8584.36s: matter how many interviews you do you
8585.76s: know how robust the data is then maybe
8588.40s: it is a good you know first foray into
8591.00s: disclosure is it though is it more
8592.80s: believe more or less believable like
8594.60s: like that's um maybe I struggle to
8596.96s: really measure that but is it more
8599.52s: believable to think that there is there
8601.56s: have been
8602.68s: possible other Generations other
8605.16s: civilizations that have been completely
8607.08s: wiped out over and over and over again
8608.68s: for the past millions and millions of
8610.52s: years or
8613.20s: that people are visiting us for the
8616.96s: first time yeah you know which which is
8619.08s: more
8620.28s: unbelievable I I think you know if you
8623.52s: were to run some like Drake like
8625.28s: equation or fmy Paradox on like past
8627.76s: civilization would be more believable
8629.60s: right would be more believable but I
8631.44s: don't think that's why it's more
8633.00s: believable to most people I think it's
8634.32s: more believable because it doesn't give
8635.76s: them an allergic reaction right because
8637.40s: they don't have to deal with anything
8638.56s: yeah it doesn't sound like a horror
8639.92s: novel like it's it's not this visceral
8642.48s: thing it's like uh you know it's like we
8644.60s: scientists have studied meteorite and
8647.32s: this this isotope I you say the word
8649.40s: isotope and they're like H but they
8650.80s: don't they don't care about the actual
8652.48s: isotope or whatever but like you know
8654.96s: it's it's not real first principles
8656.64s: thinking going on it's like what is more
8658.64s: acceptable to your own you know uh
8661.44s: biases yeah yeah it's you know the more
8664.60s: the more the more the closer you look
8666.48s: the more evidence we find anyways of
8669.00s: something right we're not finding less
8671.32s: evidence of something yeah you know
8673.44s: that's also just like a constant here
8675.60s: that's true like no matter where you
8677.16s: look whether you're looking here in the
8679.12s: oceans in the ground in the mountains or
8680.96s: in space in low orbit in out of orbit on
8683.76s: other planets on our moon outside of our
8685.92s: galaxy coming into the you know whatever
8688.52s: we're not seeing less evidence yeah I
8690.48s: agree and it's accelerating and I would
8692.92s: you know I would bet a lot of money that
8696.16s: in our life our understanding of
8699.40s: humanity and its place in the cosmos is
8702.08s: going to fundamentally shift yeah I
8703.68s: think so too and I bet I bet um Mick
8706.28s: West three years ago I think it was like
8708.96s: $10,000 or I tried to bet him $10,000
8711.28s: and then he wanted to make it 1,000
8713.68s: which which I should get the best odds
8715.80s: in the world on this particular bet
8717.40s: which I if he really believes what he's
8719.40s: selling skin in the game that's all it
8721.16s: matters that's all matters what the hell
8723.60s: I know and I said you know we'd get like
8726.44s: uh make it 100 Grand evidence of
8728.36s: non-human intelligence yeah right
8730.52s: non-human intelligence propulsed you
8732.88s: know uh craft and um and and and and we
8737.40s: made it like you know it would be like
8739.00s: 80% polling of like General Society
8741.92s: including Academia or whatever as like
8743.88s: the market it's really impossible to
8745.52s: like so I think it's an insane bet for
8747.80s: me to make it one to one odds three
8749.32s: years ago insan this before grush came
8751.56s: out before grush yeah and I did no grush
8753.68s: at the time so maybe Insider bet yeah
8756.76s: right did you did you text him after
8758.80s: grash came out uh were you like hey I
8762.04s: did hey how how's it looking now yeah
8763.76s: was it we're closer to 5050 what's going
8765.44s: on even then the odds are sliding from
8767.32s: like a bil jillion to one against me to
8770.12s: like yeah like maybe I had some
8771.52s: asymmetric knowledge to like you know a
8773.68s: million to one no still it's still
8775.44s: insane odds um you know so yeah I know
8780.72s: that's surprising though that Mick
8781.88s: wouldn't take a 10K bet like that no
8783.80s: it's absurd yeah yeah right put your
8785.24s: money where your mouth is that's very
8786.92s: telling I agree have you ever brought it
8788.64s: up to him since yeah we had a a debate I
8790.96s: host a debate between him and Mer Von I
8793.84s: did I was like I was like hey man we had
8795.68s: a debate and he was like well you know I
8797.16s: don't like to gamble and I moved it down
8799.08s: to 1K and I was like well still gambling
8802.28s: yeah and it should be like you're you
8804.64s: should money in the bank you know you
8806.76s: should put your entire net worth behind
8807.96s: that you should put your entire net
8809.32s: worth behind that way that the way that
8811.16s: you're slinging totally you know I'm
8813.36s: also like I'm pretty confident on this
8815.60s: in a long time scale but what I'm
8817.48s: betting is uh historical anomaly not
8820.88s: only on the order of the capern
8823.00s: Revolution like greater than that like
8825.44s: why why in at this time and maybe we've
8827.92s: known this at times in past so maybe I'm
8830.16s: framing this the wrong way but like it
8832.64s: is you know uh at the very best like a
8836.28s: you know 5 10,000 year cycle of like
8838.76s: ever having interactions with the
8840.84s: and that's on that's on the optimistic
8842.40s: side so it's like an extremely risky bet
8845.16s: for me to make extremely risky yeah but
8848.04s: I like
8849.20s: it I figured at the at the very least it
8851.80s: would be a good you know fun story or
8853.72s: whatever great story even greater if if
8856.76s: you win the money that's right yeah
8859.04s: although he lowered it yeah it becomes
8861.36s: the most irrelevant story actually if
8862.72s: you win the money yeah yeah exactly yeah
8864.72s: yeah that's true then it's uh doesn't
8866.56s: pales in comparison to the thing itself
8868.96s: exactly yeah
8870.68s: the last one here by Dan Eastwood okay
8873.52s: cool you had the ability to remote view
8876.08s: a specific event in time which moment
8879.24s: would you choose and why that's such an
8882.00s: interesting question I love that well
8884.68s: this is I don't know why I'm immediately
8885.96s: thinking this but um this woman went on
8889.20s: Shawn Ryan this uh this remote viewer do
8891.64s: you know who I'm talking about uh yeah
8893.52s: Angela Ford Angela Ford yeah she's
8895.28s: amazing she yeah the crucifixion yeah
8898.84s: and that reaction she had like I've seen
8901.12s: it but I can't about it I found that
8903.44s: fascinating I don't know if I remote
8904.92s: view the cruci um but I just a wild
8908.08s: thing to see that would be a wild thing
8909.36s: to see
8911.08s: um God that's so
8915.48s: fascinating well it depends because
8917.64s: don't don't you have to know the thing
8919.24s: is real like I could do some biblical
8921.04s: event or whatever but like I don't know
8923.04s: it's if it happen right you can't you
8925.28s: can't verify but um let's assume that
8928.84s: your Pat price okay and you just know it
8931.64s: to be true you just know it to be true
8934.20s: right I would want to see um Jesus going
8938.24s: up on the cloud or uh in the book of
8941.28s: Acts or I'd want to see the the wheels
8943.52s: of Ezekiel you know the the ezekiel's
8945.88s: charot yeah um I think those are very
8949.20s: interesting or I'd want to see the St
8950.76s: Francis of aisi interaction with the
8953.16s: seraphim you know I think those are very
8955.68s: interesting to me the Book of Enoch if
8958.88s: that happened you know go up to meet
8961.44s: Metatron the angel like I think things
8963.44s: like that uh uturo uturo buun the
8967.68s: Japanese um the lady that came out of
8970.44s: the UA UFO that was floating in the
8973.16s: water wow like the 1600s or something I
8976.44s: would love to see that there's paintings
8978.76s: of her there's a red-haired lady in
8981.92s: Japan oh wow coming out of uh a saucer
8984.88s: like they said like vessel like a ship
8987.72s: in the water and she came out on land
8990.04s: and she spoke a funny language they
8991.44s: didn't understand her and she went back
8992.92s: in and they never saw her again there's
8994.08s: like a whole legend about her that's
8995.52s: amazing yeah urun that would be awesome
8999.12s: yeah that would be so crazy and cool but
9002.04s: yeah I think something like that but I
9003.68s: don't know I mean there's so many I mean
9007.96s: hman yeah I mean hman Air Force baseland
9010.68s: that would be extremely interesting that
9013.48s: I mean
9015.16s: h yeah you had a chronovisor to like
9018.60s: actually watch something you know what I
9020.44s: mean like or the treaty the treaty
9022.68s: between eyes and treaty 54 where he says
9025.76s: he has a dental appointment and palm
9028.08s: treaty or whatever uhhuh yeah like um so
9031.56s: I don't know there's so many interesting
9034.12s: one but I would go the more mystical
9035.64s: religious route I think yeah Buddha what
9037.96s: about you how would you answer
9042.84s: that I don't know I would like you know
9045.96s: what I I don't know I think I'd like to
9048.60s: see I'd love to see the the Phoenix
9051.68s: Lights yeah I think it's just because
9054.68s: Phoenix Lights are like Virginia MH only
9057.36s: because it's um it's just so close it's
9061.28s: in my
9062.32s: lifetime yeah and I feel for some reason
9065.32s: that that's more significant to me for I
9068.20s: don't even know why just intuitively
9069.76s: like even when I heard about the stories
9071.20s: I was like this is yeah happening like
9073.36s: even Ariel like these all happen around
9075.56s: the same time which is wild but like
9077.16s: that is wild
9078.56s: yeah but and then Ariel was
9081.24s: 949 96 was yeah Ariel was 94 I think and
