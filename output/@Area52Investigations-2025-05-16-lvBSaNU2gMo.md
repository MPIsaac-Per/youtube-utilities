3.28s: So, I'm trying to get my life back on
5.92s: track. Um, you know, lost my job, got
8.48s: wrongfully terminated. Um, you know, a
11.04s: lot of financial issues and so that led
12.88s: to a lot of stress between me and my
14.24s: family where I was
15.64s: staying. Finally caught a break, got a
18.32s: car uh on Facebook Marketplace and I
21.20s: headed out to Oxnar, California. And so,
24.16s: I drive and I always try to assume is it
26.40s: a plane or is it something else? But no,
28.56s: there's no mistaking it. It was a egg
30.08s: [ __ ] UFO watching me and I felt it
32.56s: watching me. And I've heard other people
34.56s: describe it, but when I felt it, it it
36.72s: just overwhelmed me. It felt like it was
38.96s: protecting me. It felt feminine. And you
42.40s: know, I was raised Roman Catholic, so
44.56s: the the silhouette reminded me of like
46.80s: the Virgin Mary.
49.28s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
50.88s: another episode of Debriefed. My name is
52.88s: Chris Ramsey and today we're going to be
55.52s: continuing our read through of the alien
58.56s: interview. So in 1947, a crash allegedly
62.00s: happened in Roswell, New Mexico and this
64.40s: lady named Matilda Mroy who was a nurse
66.80s: at the time stationed in Roswell had
69.44s: written a letter to the author by the
71.44s: name of Lawrence R. Spencer, indicating
74.16s: that she in fact was the only person
76.32s: able to communicate with the sole
78.80s: surviving alien being of the Roswell
82.68s: crash. Spent a subsequent 6 weeks with
86.08s: this alien, interrogating it, asking it
88.56s: questions on behalf of the US
90.24s: intelligence agencies and the
92.24s: government. This part is where it gets
94.16s: really interesting because in this part,
95.92s: this is where Arrol, the name of the
98.12s: alien, gets more familiar, significantly
102.08s: so, with the English language and starts
104.56s: to really fill the blanks. And right
107.52s: before we get started, folks, a quick
109.36s: word from our lovely
112.20s: sponsors. Welcome back to the skiff,
115.04s: where sensitive files are locked down,
116.80s: communications are secure, and the
119.36s: information we handle never leaves this
121.76s: room. While we go to extreme lengths to
123.92s: protect classified details out there,
126.64s: your personal data is just drifting
128.16s: around in the open. Data brokers are
130.64s: gathering it all. Your location, your
132.88s: purchases, your search history, quietly
135.68s: selling it off to whoever's buying and
137.92s: tracking them down yourself. Well,
140.56s: that's a full-time job. You'd spend
142.56s: weeks filing requests, pushing
144.16s: paperwork, and hoping someone on the
146.00s: other end even listens. That's why I use
148.48s: Incogn. You see, Cognney steps in as
150.88s: your personal data ops team. You
152.88s: authorize them once and they handle the
154.96s: legal side, demanding that dozens, even
157.12s: hundreds of data brokers erase your
159.68s: private details. Efficient, quiet, and
162.72s: effective. Go to
164.76s: incogn.com/eria52 and use code area52 to
167.60s: get 60% off your annual plan. If we
170.32s: protect what's inside the skiff,
172.24s: shouldn't you protect what's outside of
173.92s: it?
175.76s: All right, folks. We paid the bills.
178.32s: Time to get into part two and chapter
181.28s: four of the alien interview. Again,
183.68s: highly recommend you guys pick this up.
185.20s: I left the link in the description. I
186.56s: know a lot of you guys have picked the
187.76s: book up. Maybe you can read along with
189.28s: me or get ahead of me. Totally up to
192.40s: you, but it is an interesting and
194.08s: fascinating read. All right, before we
195.52s: dive into this, there are a few
196.56s: connections that we've made since we
198.68s: last read uh the the chapters. Two names
202.96s: were sort of mentioned by Matilda. She
206.16s: said that the government brought in
207.76s: other psychics or people who were
209.44s: psychically inclined to try and
211.36s: interview the being without any success.
213.84s: These two people were named uh first was
216.40s: Gertrude something or other and the
218.72s: second was Krishna my both Krishna
222.84s: my Gertrude lady. If these are the
225.92s: people that I'll be referring to, this
228.72s: makes this very interesting and it does
230.96s: add a point of sort of conjecture or a
233.68s: point of reference uh for this
236.16s: potentially being a real interview.
238.48s: Well, Gertrude or something another is
240.16s: mentioned. Now, Gertrude Schmidler was a
243.96s: parasychologist in the early 1900s.
247.52s: Well, in 1935, I believe she graduated.
250.80s: She got her doctorate at Harvard
252.76s: University where she also attended a
255.60s: lecture which was about extrensory
258.24s: perception, a lecture by a
259.76s: parasychologist by the name of Gardenner
261.36s: Murphy. But she also then started
263.20s: reading JB Ryan's book who's head of the
266.24s: Ryan Institute uh which studies
268.80s: paranormal sort of parasychological
271.52s: uh sciences. Schmidler graduated with a
274.88s: doctorate in psychology and focused the
277.28s: rest of her career and her life's work
280.84s: on psychical abilities. She even worked
285.12s: in the 1970s with a famous remote viewer
288.72s: for the government, Ingo Swan. I've
291.04s: never heard of Schmidler before,
292.56s: Gertrude Schmidler, but the second I
295.12s: started diving down the rabbit hole, I
297.36s: started noticing that she actually pops
299.52s: up everywhere. And in the 1940s
302.64s: especially is where she really ramped up
305.28s: her work on psychic behavior in
308.20s: parasychology. A very reputable name and
310.96s: she would use highly sort of
313.12s: scientifically rigorous standards for
315.36s: all of her psychic testing. So very
318.08s: interesting lady indeed. I'm surprised I
320.08s: haven't heard of her before, but I know
322.32s: some of you have reached out to me uh
325.36s: following the video saying, "Hey, this
327.36s: might be the person they're referring
328.64s: to." Now the second person might
330.80s: possibly be Jidu Krishna Merti. He is
334.64s: from India but he actually was in the
337.52s: United States during the 1940s. He lived
340.72s: in Ohigh California which is known as a
343.12s: bit of a hub for sort of this spiritual
345.68s: and sort of esoteric practices. But
348.16s: apparently during the 1940s,
350.32s: particularly during World War II, he
352.40s: stayed relatively quiet and withdrew
355.52s: from public talks. and then in the late
358.16s: 1940s began re-engaging with public
360.64s: dialogue and writings. So extremely
364.40s: interesting that both of these people
366.56s: would have been named dropped. Now did
368.40s: the author Lawrence Spencer have access
370.88s: to the internet when he wrote this book?
373.64s: Yes. Is it possible that he just
377.52s: somehow, you know, Googled a few names
380.40s: back then that who who may have been
382.32s: prominent figures? Of course. But does
384.88s: that make it any less interesting? I
386.72s: don't think so. So, folks, if you don't
389.76s: mind, I would highly suggest you uh
392.24s: checking your disbelief at the door.
393.84s: Let's suspend it for the next hour or so
396.64s: so that we can fully delve into the lore
399.76s: that is the alien interview. As we know,
402.32s: belief sometimes just gets in the way of
404.00s: a good story. So, leave a like,
406.08s: subscribe, and let's get into it. Also,
408.00s: by the way, join the internship if you
410.40s: if you really enjoy this and you want to
411.92s: get some behind the scenes on some of
413.20s: these readroughs or just my thoughts in
415.44s: general. I post weekly. I post once a
417.60s: week uh for the members. So whether
419.44s: that's on Patreon or whether that's here
420.80s: on YouTube, it's five bucks a month and
422.72s: there's a whole bunch of other perks
424.40s: that you get with that. You guys can
425.60s: check that out if uh if that's something
427.20s: you're into. Chapter
428.84s: 4, the language
431.32s: barrier. Matilda writes, "After I
434.24s: explained what I thought were the
435.36s: reasons for the noans answer to the
438.08s: intelligence agents, there was a great
440.72s: deal of upset and turmoil. A very heated
443.92s: discussion took place between some of
445.36s: the intelligence officers, military
447.12s: officials, psychologists, and language
449.56s: interpreters. This lasted for several
451.92s: hours. It was finally decided that I
454.48s: should be allowed to continue to
456.16s: interview the alien, provided I could
458.24s: get a satisfactory answer from her to
460.48s: the following
462.20s: question. And here's the question. What
464.88s: assurance or proof do you require from
466.80s: us that will make you feel safe enough
468.24s: to answer our questions?
471.16s: answer. Only she speaks. Only she hears.
476.00s: Only she questions. No others. Must
479.28s: learn slash know slash understand.
482.96s: Matilda's note writes, "When I returned
485.12s: from the interview room to report the
486.80s: alien response to this question, I
488.48s: received a grim and skeptical reception
490.80s: from the assembled intelligence agents
492.56s: and military personnel. They could not
494.64s: understand what the alien meant by
496.40s: this." I think that's kind of funny
498.96s: because like if you were trying to be
501.92s: the only person to ever talk to this
504.32s: alien, that's also what you would say.
506.72s: You would also lie to them and be like,
508.08s: "No, it's only this person." That's what
510.48s: that's what it's saying. It's not me. I
512.08s: would be that guy, by the way. I'd be
513.12s: like, "No, the alien says it only wants
515.04s: me." I don't know. Weird. I admitted
517.84s: that I couldn't really understand what
519.36s: she meant either. But I was doing the
521.44s: best I could to articulate her
522.96s: telepathic intentions. I told the
525.60s: officials that perhaps the communication
527.20s: problem had to do with my inability to
529.28s: understand the telepathic language of
530.72s: the alien clearly enough to be
532.68s: satisfactory. I was so discouraged at
534.88s: that point, I almost felt like giving
536.32s: up. Again, she's struggling with the
541.96s: translation of intention into words.
544.72s: Because as we discussed in the previous
546.68s: episode,
548.60s: telepathy I don't think is just words. I
551.20s: think it's impressions and intentions.
553.04s: And if you can convey that, you can
555.88s: probably put more information into those
558.64s: things than you could into a string of
560.64s: words. I mean, it could happen just more
562.40s: rapidly, but it might be really hard to
564.88s: decipher and to properly have the
568.24s: correct amount of vernacular to convey,
572.48s: you know, those intentions. And now
574.16s: there was even more arguments than
575.60s: before. I was sure I was going to be
577.44s: removed from my position in spite of the
579.44s: fact that the alien refused to
580.72s: communicate with anyone else or that no
582.88s: one else had been found who could
584.16s: communicate with her. Fortunately, a
586.48s: very clever fellow named John Nubble,
589.44s: who is a Japanese language specialist
591.52s: from the Navy, had an explanation and a
594.40s: solution to the problem. He explained
596.96s: that first the problem had very little
599.28s: to do with the inability of the alien to
601.28s: communicate. It had more to do with her
603.88s: unwillingness to communicate with anyone
606.16s: other than myself. Second, in order for
609.28s: any clear, comprehensive communication
611.60s: to happen, both parties needed to
613.76s: understand and communicate through a
615.28s: common language. Okay, this language
618.64s: specialist, is this a new is this a real
621.12s: person, John Nubble? First of all, I'd
623.20s: like to know, is this a real person? Can
624.88s: that be confirmed? I couldn't find any
627.04s: verifiable information about a John
628.96s: Nubble serving as a Japanese language
631.12s: specialist in the US Navy. The Alien
634.00s: interview book mentions him in the
635.84s: context of helping the alien learn
637.68s: English, but there are no known
639.52s: historical records or credible
641.12s: references confirming his existence.
643.52s: It's possible that he is a fictional or
645.76s: composite character created by the
647.68s: author. Yeah, okay, that's possible,
649.36s: too. something I actually didn't
650.72s: consider that this might be a pseudonym,
652.72s: but perhaps this is completely made up
654.48s: or perhaps a real person and they
656.44s: completely, you know, deleted his
658.72s: identity. Who knows? Okay, so eventually
661.32s: Jon pretty much suggests that there were
664.88s: two options. Matilda learned the
667.92s: language of the alien or the alien had
670.88s: to learn to speak English. Only the
674.16s: latter was possible. So then they
678.04s: began to try and persuade Arrol to learn
682.08s: English. So the language specialist
684.24s: suggested that she take several
685.92s: children's book and a basic reading
687.68s: primer and grammar text into the
690.88s: interview room. And the plan was to sit
693.12s: next to the alien and read aloud and
695.76s: pointing to the text that she was
697.52s: reading with her finger so that the
699.04s: alien could follow along. The theory was
701.20s: that the alien could eventually be
702.48s: taught to read just as a child is taught
704.80s: to read by word and sound association
706.88s: with written word as well as instruction
709.52s: in fundamental grammar. And she writes,
711.68s: "They also assumed, I think, that if the
713.28s: alien was intelligent enough to
714.48s: communicate with me telepathically and
716.24s: fly a spacecraft across the galaxy, that
718.56s: she would probably learn to speak a
719.84s: language as quickly as a 5-year-old or
722.20s: faster." She returned to the interview
724.24s: room and proposed this idea to Errol.
727.20s: Errol did not object and no one had a
729.60s: better idea. So that's exactly what they
731.68s: did. Here we go. Chapter five, reading
735.76s: lessons. You know, even if this is a
737.60s: fictional piece, I think it's such an
739.28s: interesting piece of universe building
741.28s: and lore, you know, that most people
743.52s: would have left out. Matilda writes, "I
745.76s: began the reading lessons with the first
747.20s: pages of a school book that had been
748.72s: used to teach pioneer children in the
750.48s: 1800s on the frontiers of America. It's
752.64s: called McGuffy's Eclectic Reader Primer
755.84s: through Sixth. She writes, "As
757.84s: instructed, I sat next to Arrol in the
759.68s: interview room, reading aloud to her
761.28s: from each successive book in the series
762.96s: of McGuffy's readers. Each of the books
765.28s: had excellent simple illustrations of
766.96s: the stories and subjects being taught,
768.96s: although they are very outdated by
770.56s: today's standards. Nonetheless, Arrol
772.48s: seemed to understand and absorb every
774.24s: letter, sound, syllable, and meaning as
776.32s: we progressed. We continued this process
779.12s: for 14 hours a day for three consecutive
782.40s: days without
784.60s: interruption except for a few meals and
787.20s: rest breaks on my part. But Errol did
790.16s: not take any breaks from anything. She
792.72s: did not sleep. Instead, she remained
794.88s: sitting in the over stuffed chair in the
796.80s: interview room reviewing the lessons we
798.72s: had already covered. When I returned
800.32s: each morning to begin where we'd left
802.08s: off, she'd already memorized the
804.32s: previous lessons and was well into the
806.32s: next pages. This pattern continued to
808.64s: accelerate until it became pointless for
811.12s: me to continue reading to her.
813.76s: So we're seeing now that Errol's
817.08s: exponential learning curve is being
819.44s: displayed for us that she is consuming,
824.20s: retaining, and presumably going to be,
827.12s: you know, regurgitating this information
829.28s: rather rapidly. Although Arrol did not
831.76s: have a mouth to speak with, she was now
833.76s: able to quote unquote think at me in
836.80s: English. At the end of these lessons,
838.88s: Arrol was able to read and study by
840.56s: herself. I showed her how to use a
842.64s: dictionary to look up new words she
844.16s: encountered. Arrol consulted the
845.60s: dictionary continually after that. From
847.92s: then on, my job was acting as a courier
850.16s: for her, requesting that reference books
852.16s: be brought to her in a steady stream.
855.20s: Wo! This little genius is like, "Bring
857.76s: me more. I must consume more knowledge."
860.72s: Next, Mr. Nubble brought in a set of
862.48s: Encyclopedia Bratannica. Errol
864.56s: especially enjoyed this because it had a
866.16s: lot of pictures. After that, she
867.92s: requested many more picture books and
869.52s: reference books with photographs and
871.04s: drawings because it was much easier to
872.56s: understand the meaning if she could see
874.24s: a picture of the thing she was studying.
877.12s: Over the next 6 days, books were brought
879.52s: from brought in from libraries all over
882.40s: the country. I presume because it wasn't
884.48s: more than a few more days before she had
887.04s: read through several hundred of them.
889.44s: She studied every subject I could
891.20s: imagine and many other very technical
893.20s: things I never wanted to know anything
895.12s: about like astronomy, metallurgy,
896.88s: engineering, mathematics, various
898.40s: technical manuals and so forth. Later
901.60s: she began to read fiction books, novels,
903.60s: poetry and the classics of literature.
905.92s: Arrol also asked to read a great many
908.08s: books on subjects in the humanities,
910.16s: especially history. I think she must
912.32s: have read at least 50 books about human
914.08s: history and archaeology. Of course, I
916.96s: made sure that she received a copy of
918.40s: the Holy Bible also, which she read from
920.88s: cover to cover without comment or
923.08s: questions. Although I continued to stay
925.36s: with Arrol for 12 to 14 hours a day,
928.08s: most of that time during the following
929.60s: week had been spent without much
931.60s: communication between us, except for an
933.36s: occasional question she asked me. The
935.28s: questions were usually meant to give her
936.80s: a sense of context or to clarify
938.64s: something in the books she was reading.
941.00s: Oddly, Arrol told me that her favorite
943.28s: books are Alice's Adventures in
947.48s: Wonderland. Very, very good choice,
949.76s: Arrol. Don Kyote Damancha, another great
953.56s: choice, and 1,01 nights. She said the
958.08s: authors of these stories showed that it
960.00s: is more important to have great spirit
962.08s: and imagination than great skill or
965.16s: power. Whoa, I love that. And that's
968.00s: something that we actually talk about a
969.68s: lot on this channel is the power of
972.92s: fiction and its ability to not only
976.60s: convey really highlevel ideas in a
980.12s: palatable absorbable
983.08s: way, but also to allow you to think, to
986.88s: allow you to ponder and imagine and be
988.88s: curious and to encourage that curiosity.
991.28s: Please one second before you hit that
992.80s: dial. I promise you this will be worth
994.32s: your time. You see, in the last few
995.68s: videos, we've been subliminally
997.36s: inserting these
999.64s: symbols. Symbols from an ancient alien
1002.32s: language. Symbols that you might find in
1005.04s: these playing cards. Symbols which can
1007.52s: only be seen
1008.68s: using a special technology. With this
1011.76s: technology and with these playing cards,
1013.28s: you'll be able to decipher what these
1015.36s: symbols mean. Now, every single video
1017.92s: will feature five of these symbols
1019.84s: hidden randomly throughout the video.
1021.60s: These symbols will translate into a
1023.28s: code. insert this code into our website
1025.68s: and you'll get a prize. You see, so far
1027.76s: every single prize has been claimed and
1029.76s: they've been claimed by an intern
1031.20s: because you see interns have early
1033.20s: access to every single video. Increase
1035.04s: your chances by becoming an intern, but
1036.56s: don't let that stop you from trying. So,
1038.24s: future agents, I appreciate your time.
1041.40s: Now, back to your regular programming. I
1044.32s: could not answer a lot of her questions,
1045.84s: so I consulted with the people in outer
1048.32s: in the outer room for answers. Most of
1050.64s: these had to do with technical and
1052.08s: scientific things. A few of her
1054.08s: questions were about the humanities. The
1056.16s: depth of complex understanding and
1058.00s: subtlety of her questions showed that
1060.08s: she had a very penetrating intellect.
1062.40s: Personally, I think she had known a lot
1064.40s: more about the culture of history of
1066.48s: Earth than she was willing to admit when
1068.40s: we started. I would soon discover how
1071.12s: much
1072.04s: more. Whoa. Oh, this is interesting how
1075.92s: the tables have turned. Now, chapter 6
1078.48s: is my education begins. meaning
1081.84s: Matilda's education is about to start.
1085.92s: She's about to get some lessons from
1087.28s: this little being. This is from
1088.72s: Matilda's personal notes. By the 15th
1091.52s: day after rescuing Arrol from the crash
1094.16s: site, I was able to communicate fluidly
1095.84s: and effortlessly with her in English.
1098.48s: She had absorbed so much written
1100.00s: material by this time that her academic
1102.32s: education far exceeded my own. Although
1105.68s: I graduated from high school in Los
1107.36s: Angeles in 1940 and attended college for
1110.56s: four years of premedical and nursing
1112.48s: training, the variety of my own reading
1114.96s: had been fairly limited. I had not
1118.08s: studied most of the subjects to which
1119.92s: Arrol had now been exposed, especially
1121.76s: considering her acute understanding,
1123.44s: very intent, very intense study habits,
1125.76s: and a nearly photographic memory. She
1128.40s: was able to recall long passages from
1130.56s: books she read. She was especially fond
1132.88s: of sections of her favorite uh stories
1135.28s: from classic literature like The
1137.20s: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, tales
1139.76s: from Guliver's Travels and Peter Pan,
1142.72s: and The Legend of Sleepy
1144.60s: Hollow. By this time, Arrol had become
1147.12s: the teacher, and I was the student. I
1150.40s: was able to learn what men of Earth do
1153.12s: not know and have no way of knowing.
1157.44s: Well, this piques my interest. Let's go
1160.24s: spit it out. The throng of scientists
1163.04s: and agents who observed us through the
1164.88s: one-way glass of our interview room,
1166.88s: whom Arrol and I, now referred to as the
1170.04s: gallery, were growing increasingly
1172.48s: impatient to ask her questions. But
1174.40s: Errol continued to refuse to allow any
1176.72s: questions to be asked of her by anyone
1178.72s: other than myself, even vicariously
1181.52s: through me as an interpreter or in
1183.64s: writing. Whoa.
1186.96s: I will take a brief moment here just to
1189.84s: acknowledge something that someone
1191.20s: pointed out in the comments as well last
1193.04s: week is that the vocabulary that this
1196.64s: nurse is using is quite extensive using
1200.48s: a word like throng, the throng of
1204.20s: scientists. And this is in quotes. So
1208.08s: this is supposedly a direct transcript
1212.64s: of what Matilda had written to the
1215.76s: author here. And if that's the case, I
1219.20s: don't know
1220.04s: whether Matilda and she even says
1222.72s: herself that her own sort of reading had
1228.00s: been fairly limited in that she didn't
1230.16s: go to school for English or literature.
1232.40s: Now, I understand that perhaps back then
1234.80s: our vocabulary might have been quite a
1238.24s: bit more expansive than today. So, I am
1242.08s: willing to take that into account.
1243.60s: However, she does write like a writer,
1246.96s: like a novelist. And I had someone else
1249.68s: comment recently that after
1252.96s: um comparing the writing style of
1256.80s: Matilda to the authors that AI found
1259.92s: that there was a lot of similarities.
1262.12s: Obviously cannot be proven but there are
1265.48s: similarities. So did the author take any
1269.04s: creative liberties perhaps? I think that
1271.28s: would be to his detriment and to the
1272.80s: detriment of the story. So we have to
1274.48s: assume that this is a transcript. But
1276.72s: then why is it so, you know, why is it
1279.52s: written with such a um writing
1283.16s: capability? It does cause for pause. I
1286.72s: will say that. So here, this is
1288.56s: interesting. On the 16th day, Arrol and
1292.44s: I sat next to each other as she read.
1295.44s: She closed the last page of a book she
1297.36s: was reading and placed it aside. I was
1299.12s: about to hand her the next book from a
1300.88s: large pile waiting to read when she
1302.64s: turned and said or thought to me, "I am
1306.64s: ready to speak
1308.52s: now." At first, I was a little confused
1310.80s: by the remark. I gestured for her to
1312.48s: continue and she began to teach me my
1314.72s: first lesson. Here we go, folks.
1317.36s: Question. What would you like to say,
1319.20s: Arrol? Arrol then proceeds to answer.
1323.84s: I've been a part of the domain
1325.44s: expeditionary force in this sector of
1327.60s: space for several thousand years.
1329.92s: However, I have not personally had
1331.92s: intimate contact with beings on Earth
1334.44s: since
1335.96s: 5965
1338.68s: BCE. It is not my primary function to
1341.68s: interact with inhabitants of planets
1343.68s: within the domain. I am an officer,
1346.08s: pilot, and engineer with many duties to
1348.72s: perform. Nonetheless, although I am
1351.36s: fluent in 347 other languages within the
1354.40s: domain, I have not been exposed to your
1356.96s: English
1358.04s: language. The last earth language with
1360.56s: which I was conversant was the Sanskrit
1364.64s: language of the Vic
1367.16s: hymns. At that time, I was a member of a
1370.08s: mission sent to investigate the loss of
1372.24s: a domain base located in the Himalaya
1374.72s: mountains. An entire battalion of
1377.12s: officers, pilots, communications, and
1380.24s: administrative personnel disappeared and
1382.32s: the base destroyed. The last Earth
1385.60s: language. That's so cool. Several
1388.16s: million years
1389.24s: ago. Whoa. Hold on. Several million.
1393.20s: Several million years ago, I was trained
1396.00s: and served as a as an investigation,
1399.12s: data evaluation, and program development
1401.68s: officer for the domain. Because I was
1405.04s: experienced in that technology, I was
1407.36s: sent to Earth as a part of the search
1409.20s: team. One of my duties involved
1411.68s: interrogation of the human population
1413.68s: that inhabited the adjoining area at
1416.00s: that
1416.76s: time. Many of the people in that region
1419.36s: reported citing vimmanas. Vimeas or
1422.80s: spacecraft in that area. I want to see
1425.68s: what that is in the Himalayas. Vmanas,
1428.72s: mythological flying craft described in
1431.52s: ancient Indian text. The term means
1433.68s: measuring out or traversing in Sanskrit
1435.84s: and is often translated as chariot or
1438.40s: palace in the
1440.20s: sky. Whoa. Following the logical
1443.28s: extension of evidence, testimony,
1445.36s: observation, as well as the absence of
1447.44s: certain evidence, I led my team to the
1449.84s: discovery that there were still old
1452.56s: Empire ships and well-hidden Old Empire
1456.08s: installations in this solar system of
1458.96s: which we had been completely unaware.
1461.68s: You and I were unable to communicate in
1463.84s: your language because I personally have
1466.32s: not been exposed to your language.
1468.72s: However, now that I have scanned the
1470.72s: books and material you provided me, this
1473.12s: data has been relayed to our space
1476.16s: station in this region and processed by
1478.88s: our communications officer through our
1481.24s: computers. It has been translated into
1483.92s: my own language and relayed back to me
1486.08s: in a context that I can think with. I
1489.04s: have also received additional
1490.64s: information from the files stored in our
1493.12s: computers about the English language and
1495.36s: domain records concerning Earth
1498.12s: civilization. This is crazy. Arrol is
1500.56s: really acting like a biological version
1502.88s: of artificial intelligence. And this by
1506.32s: the way was written prior to you know
1508.48s: any modern GPT or language models that
1511.44s: we have. But just very interesting that
1514.32s: uh you know this this sort of concept
1516.88s: exists here. Now I am prepared to give
1519.12s: you certain information that I feel will
1521.44s: be of great value to you. I will tell
1523.60s: you the truth. Although truth is
1525.60s: relative to all other truth, I wish to
1527.92s: share with you as honestly and
1529.52s: accurately as possible truth as I see it
1531.84s: within the boundaries of my integrity to
1533.76s: myself, to my race, and without
1535.68s: violating my obligations to the
1537.52s: organization I serve and have sworn to
1539.76s: uphold and
1541.40s: protect. Okay, I thought this is
1544.16s: Matilda. Will you answer the questions
1546.72s: from the gallery now?
1548.84s: No, I will not answer questions. I will
1552.32s: provide information to you that I think
1554.24s: will be beneficial to the well-being of
1556.16s: the immortal spiritual beings who have
1558.40s: comprised humanity who comprise humanity
1561.20s: and that will foster the survival of all
1563.36s: the myriad life forms and the
1565.36s: environment of Earth as it is a part of
1567.44s: my mission to ensure the preservation of
1569.96s: Earth. Personally, it is my conviction
1572.80s: that all sentient beings are immortal
1575.44s: spiritual beings. This includes human
1577.92s: beings. For the sake of accuracy and
1580.08s: simplicity, I will use the madeup word
1582.64s: is be. Because the primary nature of the
1586.16s: immortal being is that they live in a
1588.40s: timeless state of
1590.60s: is. And the only reason for their
1593.20s: existence is that they decide to be.
1597.28s: Whoa.
1600.56s: What an
1602.44s: interesting thought experiment that is
1605.20s: that these beings just are but they
1608.32s: decide to be. So they are
1613.80s: isbes. What a cool what a cool concept.
1617.04s: No matter how lowly they're stationed in
1619.12s: a society, every isby deserves the
1622.32s: respect and treatment that I myself
1624.16s: would like to receive from others. Each
1626.32s: person on Earth continues to be an isby
1629.36s: whether they are aware of that fact or
1631.64s: not. Bunch of isbes out there. This is
1635.60s: rather fascinating to me
1637.80s: because now we're talking about this
1641.44s: idea of perhaps the human body being a
1644.80s: soul container, right? Very high level
1647.84s: spiritual sort of esoteric out there
1650.80s: fringe idea.
1653.16s: But you know this has been echoed
1655.52s: throughout many
1657.16s: religions, many philosophers, many
1660.44s: parasychologists. If you look into past
1662.48s: life regression ideas or between life
1665.64s: regressions, this
1667.96s: existentialist conversation can go on
1671.20s: for hours and it's something I'm very
1672.72s: fascinated by. Matilda writes, "I will
1675.68s: never forget this conversation. Her tone
1677.60s: was very matterof fact and emotionless.
1680.48s: However, for the first time, I sensed
1682.40s: the presence of a warm and real
1684.72s: personality in Arrol. Her reference to
1688.40s: immortal spiritual beings struck me like
1690.88s: a flash of light in a dark room. I had
1693.60s: never before considered that a human
1695.28s: being could be an immortal
1698.60s: being. I thought that status or power
1701.20s: was reserved solely for the Father, the
1703.12s: Son, and the Holy Ghost. And because I
1705.28s: am a devout Catholic and subject to the
1707.36s: word of the Lord Jesus, the Holy
1710.04s: Father, I have never thought of a woman
1712.64s: as an immortal spiritual being either,
1715.28s: not even the Holy Mother Mary. Yet, when
1717.60s: Arrol thought that thought, I became
1719.92s: vividly aware for the first time that
1721.76s: she personally was an immortal spiritual
1724.36s: being. And so are we all.
1728.32s: Now, it's a bit of a theoretical, you
1732.16s: know, pondering,
1734.36s: but I guess what an alien being, you're
1737.60s: coming face to face with this thing and
1739.52s: it's talking to you in your mind and it
1742.24s: tells you for certain that you are
1745.16s: this. I think that realization is much
1747.76s: more profound and powerful, you know,
1749.92s: cuz we can think it, we can sort of
1751.92s: believe it or have faith in that idea.
1753.84s: But I think when this other being who
1755.60s: clearly demonstrates these other worldly
1758.20s: abilities is now conveying to you this
1761.80s: idea, I think you probably believe it a
1764.48s: lot more than if it just came from
1766.00s: yourself for whatever reason that is.
1768.72s: We're always seeking external, you know,
1771.04s: validation. And that's part of the
1772.80s: search for extraterrestrial life is to
1774.80s: give us these answers. But if this being
1777.12s: did choose to give us an answer like
1779.84s: that, I mean, that would blow my mind.
1781.20s: that would like, you know, concretize
1783.44s: whatever idea I already had. Maybe I'm
1786.00s: just gullible. Maybe we shouldn't be
1787.92s: believing all the propaganda these
1789.84s: aliens are feeding into our brains. But
1791.92s: I, for one, would be happy to oblige.
1795.12s: Arrol sensed that she sensed that I was
1797.12s: confused about the idea. She said she
1799.04s: would demonstrate to me that I am also
1801.04s: an immortal spiritual being. She said,
1803.20s: "Be above your body." Immediately, I
1807.12s: realized that I was outside of my body,
1810.00s: looking down from the ceiling at the top
1812.16s: of my body's head. I was also able to
1815.28s: see the room around me, including
1816.88s: Arrol's body, sitting in the chair next
1818.56s: to my own body. After a moment, I
1820.80s: realized the simple but shocking reality
1823.28s: that I am not a
1829.08s: body. She just realized that she is more
1831.76s: than her physical body.
1835.20s: You know, for those of you who haven't
1836.80s: already checked it out, I highly
1838.64s: encourage you to check out a three-part
1840.40s: documentary series that I made on astral
1843.20s: projection, leaving the body.
1846.80s: It felt like my consciousness was like
1848.40s: flapping behind me like like a cape in
1850.40s: the wind. The experience seemed like it
1853.76s: lasted thousands of years. And I'm
1856.40s: standing like this and suddenly I
1858.32s: realize that I'm standing behind myself.
1862.56s: So, as he realizes he's out of body,
1864.40s: he's like, "Well, what do I do now?" And
1866.56s: looking at my hand and thinking, "Can I
1868.48s: stick my hand through the glass?" And
1870.88s: sure enough, I could And I felt my body
1874.36s: lighter than before. And I felt like I
1877.28s: could lift out of my body. It's like
1879.76s: what Bob and Rose says, you're you're
1881.84s: more than your physical body.
1884.56s: I felt something bumping against my
1886.48s: shoulder. What I was bumping against was
1889.36s: the ceiling of my bedroom.
1893.36s: Now, obviously, this caught the
1894.48s: attention of the
1896.28s: CIA. The first thought I had in my mind
1899.52s: was, "This is ancient."
1904.40s: My soul came out of the mold of my body.
1909.64s: 3:09 a.m. This was the first time I left
1912.72s: my body.
1915.28s: to this day, you know, I still think was
1918.24s: not a dream. Human beings are magical. I
1922.48s: want people to understand that. That's
1924.32s: what this whole place is for. We all
1927.28s: have individual power that is immense.
1930.80s: Uh it's not for everybody, but it's
1933.84s: available to everybody. Truth really is
1936.32s: stranger than fiction. The one main
1939.20s: thing I got from the out of body
1941.12s: experience is the absolute knowledge
1943.60s: that I would transcend uh physical
1946.00s: mortality. I'm going to take you through
1948.40s: every single part of the process as much
1951.28s: as I can, as much as I'm allowed to, and
1953.84s: uh figure out how to leave my body.
1958.07s: [Music]
1959.68s: But I made a three-part documentary on
1961.60s: on the
1964.24s: uh process of leaving the body because
1966.00s: it had happened to me involuntarily and
1968.80s: then subsequently through months and
1970.72s: months of meditation I was able
1973.56s: to leave my physical body uh multiple
1977.04s: times and I documented this and I I went
1979.20s: into a deep dive and talked to experts
1981.68s: and um just people who are really
1984.88s: familiar with the matter um you
1988.32s: It it was one of the earlier things we
1989.84s: did on this channel, but highly
1991.60s: encourage you guys to check it out if at
1992.88s: all you're interested in that type of
1994.56s: thing. To me, I was just still am very
1997.60s: fascinated by this idea. In that moment,
1999.68s: a black veil lifted and for the first
2002.80s: time in my life and for a very long time
2005.36s: into the past, I realized that I'm not
2008.32s: my soul, but that I am me, a spiritual
2014.32s: being.
2016.08s: This was an unexplainable epiphany, but
2019.28s: one that fills me with joy and relief I
2021.68s: cannot recall having experienced ever
2025.88s: before. As for the immortal part, I do
2029.04s: not understand her meaning as I have
2030.80s: always been taught that I am not
2032.68s: immortal. A spirit perhaps, but
2035.12s: certainly not
2037.48s: immortal. After a moment, I'm not sure
2040.24s: how long, Arrol asked me if I had a
2042.32s: better understanding of this idea.
2044.32s: Suddenly, I was back inside my body
2046.40s: again and said out loud, "Yes, I see
2049.36s: what you
2051.08s: mean." I was so takenback by the
2053.68s: experience that I had to get up from my
2055.36s: chair and walk around the room for a few
2057.04s: minutes. I made an excuse that I needed
2059.52s: to get a drink of water and go to the
2061.20s: restroom, which I did. In the restroom,
2063.76s: I looked at myself in the mirror. I used
2067.76s: the toilet, refreshed my makeup, and
2070.48s: straightened my uniform. After 10 or 15
2073.04s: minutes, I felt more normal again and
2076.64s: returned to the interview room. After
2078.56s: that, I felt as though I was no longer
2080.24s: just an interpreter for Arrol. I felt as
2083.20s: though I was a kindred spirit. I felt
2086.56s: like I was safe at home with a trusted
2089.60s: friend or family member as close as I
2092.08s: have, as close as I ever had. Arrol
2095.76s: sensed and understood my confusion about
2097.84s: the concept of personal immortality. She
2100.48s: began her first lesson with me by
2103.44s: explaining this to
2105.32s: me. Again, this this one I'm, you know,
2108.24s: being fiction or not, the ideas that are
2112.00s: being discussed here on a personal
2114.00s: level,
2115.16s: I've I've felt what that feels
2118.76s: like. Um, not trying to convince anyone
2122.88s: of anything, but you know, I've
2126.64s: perceivably exited my body during a
2129.76s: waking meditative state, completely
2132.52s: lucid, and saw myself laying down.
2135.60s: Right? This happened to me. I have
2138.08s: complete recollection of the entire
2140.16s: thing. I was not asleep when this
2142.12s: happened.
2143.96s: And after that moment, I was severely
2149.04s: rocked to my core because it completely
2152.64s: expands your perception of what you
2155.20s: might be. And I say what you might be
2158.40s: because again, you know, there is this
2160.96s: reluctance within me
2163.16s: to completely give into this idea.
2167.76s: be it
2169.48s: my magic based skepticism which I've
2172.64s: been fostering for you know nearly 20
2175.56s: years but it rings true and it feels
2181.32s: true when I look into these things you
2184.40s: know it's it's a very profound
2187.88s: experience whatever it was forces you to
2191.60s: let go
2193.32s: of the physical attachment we have to
2196.00s: our bodies and to the ideas that are
2198.96s: attached to that physical the ideas of
2202.96s: materialism and all this stuff. It's
2204.64s: just it, you know, go go check that
2207.60s: documentary out if you haven't already.
2209.12s: I I I put a lot of work into it and it's
2212.16s: uh it's it's worth a look. Even if
2213.92s: you're a skeptic, I go into it being a
2216.56s: skeptic. Errol told me her reasons for
2218.88s: coming to Earth and for being in the
2220.80s: area of the 509th Bomber Squadron. She
2224.08s: was sent by her superior officers to
2226.00s: investigate the explosions of nuclear
2227.68s: weapons which have been tested in New
2229.12s: Mexico. Her superiors ordered her to
2231.60s: gather information from the atmosphere
2233.20s: that could be used to determine the
2234.64s: extent of radiation and potential harm
2237.28s: this might cause to the environment.
2239.20s: During her mission, the spacecraft was
2241.04s: struck by a lightning which caused her
2243.68s: to lose control and crash. The
2246.32s: spacecraft Okay, hold on. This is one
2249.36s: point of contention that a lot of you
2250.72s: have brought up and I think rightfully
2252.40s: so. If you are millions of years old and
2255.60s: have all the technology and are able to
2257.68s: bounce around the universe at will,
2261.12s: wouldn't
2263.24s: you prepare for a lightning storm in
2266.32s: some way? Wouldn't Wouldn't you know,
2267.68s: wouldn't you have
2269.80s: conquered the effects that lightning
2272.24s: might have on your technology? It's a
2274.32s: it's a valid question. The spacecraft is
2276.96s: operated by isbes who use doll
2281.32s: bodies in much the same way that an
2283.68s: actor wears a mask in costume. It is
2286.48s: like a mechanical tool through which to
2288.48s: operate in the physical world. She as
2291.44s: well as all of the other isbes of the
2293.68s: officer class and their superiors
2295.84s: inhabit these doll bodies when they are
2298.56s: on duty in space. When they are not on
2301.20s: duty, they leave the body and operate,
2303.76s: think, communicate, travel, and exist
2306.24s: without the use of a body. Whoa. Bob
2310.56s: Lazard mentioned the idea of containers,
2313.68s: you know, which which is something he
2315.04s: read in those blue documents that we
2316.88s: that they referred to us as
2318.84s: containers. This lines up. The bodies
2321.28s: are constructed of synthetic materials
2323.36s: including a very sensitive electrical
2325.52s: nervous system to which each ISB adjusts
2328.56s: themselves or tune in to an electronic
2332.12s: wavelength that is matched uniquely to
2334.96s: the wavelength or frequency emitted by
2338.36s: each. Each ISB is capable of creating a
2342.24s: unique wave frequency which identifies
2344.72s: them much like a radio signal frequency.
2348.64s: This serves in part as identification
2351.36s: like a fingerprint. The doll body acts
2354.24s: like a radio receiver for the ISB. No
2357.44s: two frequencies or doll bodies are
2359.68s: exactly the
2361.40s: same. The bodies of each crew member are
2364.64s: likewise tuned into and connected to the
2367.12s: nervous system built into the
2368.92s: spacecraft. The spacecraft is built in
2371.36s: much the same way as the doll body. It
2373.76s: is adjusted specifically to the
2375.44s: frequency of each ISB crew member.
2378.64s: Therefore, the craft can be operated by
2380.72s: the thoughts or energy emitted by the
2383.40s: ISB. It is really a very simple direct
2386.88s: control system. So, there are no
2388.88s: complicated controls or navigation
2390.80s: equipment on board the spacecraft. They
2393.12s: operate as an extension of the
2397.24s: ISBY. Again, this really corroborates
2400.88s: this idea that these craft are alive to
2405.52s: a certain extent, as alive as the doll
2407.60s: bodies or as alive as the Isby that
2410.32s: inhabits
2411.48s: it, you know, and the fact that
2414.52s: each
2416.12s: vessel is tuned to the frequency of its
2420.76s: Isby makes me think of the 4chan
2424.76s: whistleblower and the underwater mobile
2427.36s: construction unit creating these crafts
2429.84s: to spec and populating them perhaps with
2433.12s: these biological dolls, if you will,
2436.00s: these grays, these biod drones. We're
2439.84s: filling some plot holes here. This is
2442.24s: really
2443.08s: interesting. When the lightning bolt
2445.04s: struck the spacecraft, this caused a
2447.04s: short circuit and consequently
2448.88s: disconnected them from the control of
2450.96s: the ship momentarily, which resulted in
2453.12s: the crash.
2455.12s: Okay, what's really interesting here,
2457.12s: this is a really cool connection in the
2459.36s: Aztec crash in this book here by William
2462.24s: Steinman. Really interesting book. Okay,
2464.96s: I'm pretty high conviction that this
2466.40s: crash happened happened a 100 ft uh in
2469.92s: diameter
2471.88s: craft soft
2474.12s: landed in the vicinity of Aztec, New
2476.88s: Mexico 8 months after the crash in
2479.36s: Roswell where up to 16 bodies were then
2484.12s: found dead in the craft. Now, these
2486.88s: bodies, some of them had been
2489.56s: charred, but the inside of the craft
2491.92s: looked particularly intact, and so did
2493.84s: the outside of the craft. Something
2496.16s: happened to where it seems like these
2499.12s: bodies
2500.20s: were
2502.28s: electrocuted, and all simultaneously
2505.76s: died like as if a mass depressurization
2509.04s: had happened or they don't really have
2510.96s: an explanation for why the they all
2514.00s: died. you know a rupture in the
2516.64s: electrical signal which is
2520.68s: controlling you know this communication
2522.96s: between the the isby spirit and the
2525.36s: physical doll body would make sense
2528.08s: let's just say it is one of the biggest
2530.40s: secrets I think if you haven't checked
2532.96s: out the Aztec crash I mean do your own
2535.04s: homework uh but definitely dig a little
2537.20s: deeper than just the surface level
2539.12s: because there's a lot to discover there
2540.88s: really interesting case was and still is
2543.36s: an officer pilot and engineer near in an
2545.44s: expeditionary force which is part of a
2547.44s: space opera civilization which refers to
2551.44s: itself as the domain. This civilization
2554.16s: controls a vast number of galaxies,
2556.24s: stars, planets, moons, and asteroids
2558.32s: throughout the area of space that is
2560.00s: approximately 1/4 of the entire physical
2562.84s: universe. The continuing mission of her
2565.28s: organization is to secure control and
2567.52s: expand territory and resources of the
2570.32s: domain.
2572.08s: Errol pointed out that their own
2573.84s: activities were very similar in many
2575.68s: ways to the European explorers who
2577.92s: discovered and claimed the new world of
2580.00s: the Holy Father, the Pope and for the
2582.56s: king of kings of Spain, Portugal and
2584.80s: later on Holland, England, France and so
2586.72s: forth. Europe benefited from the
2588.88s: property acquired from the native
2590.56s: inhabitants. However, the native
2592.32s: inhabitants were never consulted with or
2595.36s: asked for their permission to become a
2597.28s: part of the domain of European nations.
2599.36s: And the soldiers and priests they sent
2601.04s: to acquire territory and wealth in order
2603.12s: to advance their
2605.16s: interests. Yeah. So, Arrol is saying
2608.24s: that they're kind of like the colonizers
2611.44s: except for the whole, you know, not
2613.92s: asking permission part.
2616.64s: Errol said that she read in a history
2618.32s: book that the Spanish king regretted the
2620.24s: brutal treatment of the native
2621.60s: inhabitants by his soldiers. He feared
2624.56s: retribution from the gods he worshiped
2627.04s: as he described in the various
2628.56s: testaments of the Bible. He asked the
2630.72s: pope to prepare a statement called the
2632.72s: requirement which was supposed to be
2634.48s: read to each of the newly encountered
2635.92s: native inhabitants. The king hoped that
2638.08s: the statement, whether it was accepted
2639.68s: or rejected by the natives, would
2641.76s: absolve the king of all responsibility
2643.92s: for the resulting slaughter and
2645.52s: enslavement of these people. He used
2648.56s: this statement as justification to
2650.08s: confiscate their lands and possessions
2652.56s: by his soldiers and the Pope's
2654.76s: priests. Apparently, the Pope personally
2657.12s: did not have any feelings of guilt or
2658.88s: responsibility in the matter.
2662.00s: Arrol thought that such actions were
2664.08s: those of a coward and that it is no
2667.52s: surprise that the territory of Spain was
2670.32s: diminished so quickly only a few years
2672.64s: later the king was dead and his empire
2674.88s: had been assimilated by the other
2676.60s: nations. So Arrol Arrol is subtly
2679.44s: hinting at karma. Errol said that this
2681.68s: sort of behavior does not occur in the
2683.28s: domain. Their leaders assume full
2685.36s: responsibility for the actions of the
2687.04s: domain and would not denigrate
2688.56s: themselves in this fashion. Nor do they
2691.36s: fear any gods or have any regret for
2693.92s: their actions. This idea reinforces my
2696.24s: earlier suggestion that Arrol and her
2698.32s: people are probably
2702.84s: atheists. In the case of the acquisition
2705.36s: of Earth by the domain, the rulers of
2707.36s: the domain have chosen not to openly
2709.28s: reveal this intention to the native
2711.44s: inhabitants of Earth until a later time
2713.84s: when it may or may not suit their
2715.92s: interests to reveal themselves. For the
2718.72s: present time, it is not strategically
2720.64s: necessary to make the presence of the
2722.48s: domain expeditionary force known to
2724.64s: mankind. In fact, until now, it has been
2727.44s: very aggressively hidden for reasons
2729.76s: that will be revealed later.
2732.96s: The asteroid belt near Earth is a very
2735.28s: small but important location for the
2736.88s: domain in this part of space. Actually,
2740.32s: some of the objects in our solar system
2743.20s: are very valuable for use as lowgravity
2746.48s: space stations. They're interested
2748.80s: primarily in the low-gravity satellites
2750.96s: in this solar system, which consists
2752.96s: mainly of the side of the moon facing
2755.12s: away from Earth and the asteroid belt,
2757.52s: which was a planet that was destroyed
2759.52s: billions of years ago, and to a lesser
2761.68s: degree, Mars and Venus. Doom structures
2765.36s: synthesized from gypsum or underground
2768.40s: bases covered by electromagnetic force
2771.08s: screens are easily constructed to house
2773.84s: the domain forces. Whoa.
2778.64s: Once an area of space is acquired by the
2780.72s: domain and becomes a part of the
2782.08s: territory under its control, it is
2783.68s: treated as the property of the domain.
2785.92s: The space station near the planet earth
2787.68s: is important only because it lay a path
2790.16s: of the domain expansion route toward the
2792.24s: center of the Milky Way galaxy and
2793.76s: beyond. Of course, everyone in the
2795.68s: domain is aware of this except for the
2797.44s: people of Earth. This sounds
2800.76s: exactly like the very beginning of The
2804.08s: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. When
2807.04s: six foot tall ape descendant Arthur
2809.12s: Dent, when he's faced with a bulldozing
2811.52s: team that would like to drive a bypass
2814.24s: through his house, he comes out in his
2817.16s: bathrobe waving his fists in the air
2819.68s: saying, "You can't just bulldoze my
2821.60s: house down to drive a bypass through
2823.84s: this place." when ironically a Vogon
2827.20s: constructor fleet appears in the
2830.52s: air and delivers the same news to the
2833.52s: Earth saying that they are also in the
2835.52s: way of a sort of intergalactic highway
2838.48s: that just happens to be uh you know
2841.12s: going through the vicinity of Earth and
2843.52s: that they have to build a bypass you
2846.64s: know through it. This sounds exactly
2848.56s: like that. Now, was Lawrence Spencer a
2851.44s: fan of Douglas
2853.24s: Adams or had Douglas
2856.04s: Adams, you know, tuned
2858.60s: in to an actual deeper truth of humanity
2861.76s: when writing his piece of, you know,
2865.60s: comical science fiction. Chapter
2868.36s: 7, a lesson in ancient history. Okay,
2871.60s: this is interesting. Now we dive into
2874.20s: some historical interpretations or
2878.84s: depictions of Earth and possibly more.
2883.92s: But this is where we get to really tie
2885.84s: in perhaps some of the
2888.28s: lertaphiles and see if anything
2890.48s: corroborates or anything meshes with
2893.44s: what we were told from, you know, the
2895.92s: reptile. Matilda talks about uh six or
2898.72s: seven men who asked for clarifications
2900.88s: of the statements. She had a
2902.08s: stenographer there. Uh she had all these
2904.48s: other people and they were trying to get
2906.64s: Errol, you know, to answer specific
2908.72s: questions prompted by the members of the
2910.56s: gallery. And she did her best to
2912.40s: reassure everyone that she would, you
2914.40s: know, try her best at making that
2916.04s: happen. But nevertheless, only three
2918.72s: things happened every day thereafter.
2921.36s: One, Arrol resolutely refused to answer
2924.32s: any questions that she sensed had been
2926.16s: posed or suggested to me by the gallery.
2929.92s: Two, Arrol continued to instruct me in
2932.72s: subject matter of her in her own voice.
2935.20s: And three, every evening after my
2938.00s: interview or instruction from Arrol, she
2940.16s: would give me a new list of subject
2942.00s: matter about which she wanted more
2943.52s: information. Each evening, I presented
2945.76s: this list to the gallery. The next day,
2948.16s: Arrol received a large stack of books,
2950.16s: magazines, article, and so forth. She
2952.16s: would study all of these during the
2953.60s: night while I slept. This pattern
2955.76s: repeated every day during the remainder
2957.20s: of the time I spent with her. The
2958.80s: subject matter of my next interview or
2960.72s: lesson from Errol continued with a brief
2962.96s: history of Earth, our solar system, and
2965.20s: nearby space from the p perspective of
2967.92s: the domain. Errol says, "Before you can
2971.28s: understand the subject of history, you
2973.20s: must first understand the subject of
2974.80s: time. Time is simply an arbitrary
2977.12s: measurement of the motion of objects
2978.80s: through space. Space is not linear.
2981.60s: Space is determined by the point of view
2983.60s: of an isb. When viewing an object, the
2987.60s: distance between an ISB and the object
2989.84s: being viewed is called space. That's a
2992.80s: great way to put it, by the way. I think
2994.48s: that's just accurate. Objects or energy
2997.36s: masses in space do not necessarily move
2999.76s: in a linear fashion. In this universe,
3002.48s: objects tend to move randomly or in a
3005.52s: curving or cyclical pattern or as
3008.24s: determined by agreed upon
3011.00s: rules. Huh. History is not only a linear
3014.80s: record of events as many authors of
3016.48s: history uh books imply because it is not
3019.60s: a string that can be stretched out and
3021.68s: marked like a measuring tool. History is
3024.56s: a subjective observation of the movement
3026.64s: of objects through space recorded from
3028.64s: the point of view of a survivor rather
3031.44s: than those of uh than of those who
3034.60s: succumbed. Yeah. I mean, you know, only
3037.44s: the winners write history. Events occur
3040.00s: interactively and concurrently. Just as
3042.64s: the biological body has a heart that
3045.52s: pumps blood, while the lungs provide
3047.44s: oxygen to the cells which reproduce
3049.92s: using energy from the sun and chemicals
3051.84s: from plants at the same time as the
3054.16s: liver drains toxic wastes from the blood
3056.16s: and eliminates them through the bladder
3057.76s: and the bowels. All of these
3059.68s: interactions are concurrent and
3061.48s: simultaneous. Although time runs
3063.52s: consecutively, events do not happen in
3065.84s: an independent linear system. In order
3068.48s: to view and understand the history or
3070.64s: reality of the past, one must view all
3072.96s: events as part of an interactive whole.
3076.00s: Time can also be sensed as a vibration
3078.32s: which is uniform throughout the entire
3080.24s: physical universe. This is a very
3082.88s: interesting way of observing it too
3084.24s: because yeah things could happen
3086.36s: simultaneously can be affected because
3088.80s: of other things happening. Writing it
3091.04s: down in a linear fashion isn't optimal,
3094.16s: but it is the only way we've found to,
3097.28s: you know, convey the idea of time. Arrol
3099.84s: explain that the isbes have been around
3101.76s: since before the beginning of the
3103.04s: universe. The reason they are called
3104.80s: immortal is because a spirit is not born
3107.92s: and cannot die, but exists in a
3110.08s: personally postulated perception of is
3113.68s: dash will
3115.08s: be. She was careful to explain that
3117.52s: every spirit is not the same. Each is
3119.60s: completely unique in identity, power,
3122.00s: awareness, and ability. The difference
3124.64s: between an Isby like Arrol and most of
3127.28s: the Isby's inhabiting bodies on Earth is
3129.52s: that Arrol can enter and depart from her
3131.68s: doll at will. She can perceive at
3134.32s: selective depths through matter. Arrol
3137.12s: and other officers of the domain can
3138.96s: communicate telepathically. Since an
3141.12s: Isby is not a physical universe entity,
3144.32s: it has no location in space or time. An
3147.52s: isby is literally immaterial. They can
3150.80s: span great distances of space instantly.
3154.08s: They can experience sensations more
3156.24s: intensely than a biological body without
3158.56s: the use of physical sensory mechanisms.
3160.96s: And Isby can exclude pain from their
3163.12s: perception. Arrol can also remember her
3165.76s: identity, so to speak, all the way back
3168.40s: into the dim mists of time for trillions
3171.12s: of years. She says that the existing
3173.52s: collection of suns in this immediate
3175.12s: vicinity of the universe have been
3177.12s: burning for the last 200 trillion years.
3179.84s: The age of the physical universe is
3181.84s: nearly infinitely old, but probably at
3184.64s: least four quadrillion years since its
3188.00s: earliest beginnings. Okay, those numbers
3190.80s: are pretty
3191.80s: arbitrary because none of us can none of
3194.56s: us can quantify a 100red billion, let
3196.64s: alone a trillion or a quadrillion. And
3200.00s: it is interesting that they said that
3201.52s: the suns have been burning for trillions
3204.00s: of years. I'm sure modern astronomers
3207.52s: and scientists would probably disagree
3209.12s: with that. But perhaps Arrol knows
3210.64s: something we don't. Time is a difficult
3212.32s: factor to measure as it depends on the
3214.64s: subjective memory of Isbes and there has
3217.84s: been no uniform record of events
3219.92s: throughout the physical universe since
3221.60s: it began. As on earth, there are many
3224.80s: different time measurement systems
3226.40s: defined by various cultures which use
3228.72s: cycles of motion and points of origin to
3230.96s: establish age and duration. The physical
3234.08s: universe itself is formed from the
3236.16s: convergence and amalgamation of many
3238.88s: other individual universes, each one of
3242.12s: which were created by an isby or group
3245.76s: of isbes. The collision of these
3248.64s: illusory universes co-mingled and
3251.04s: coalesed and were solidified to form a
3253.60s: mutually created universe. Because it is
3256.48s: agreed that the energy and forms can be
3259.28s: created but not destroyed. This creative
3262.08s: process has continued to form an
3264.32s: everexpanding universe of nearly
3266.32s: infinite physical
3269.00s: proportions. Whoa. So Errol is basically
3272.24s: saying that these spiritual beings
3274.48s: create universes and because you can't
3276.80s: uncreate something, it's just been
3278.40s: ongoing kind of forever. This also comes
3281.36s: up in the book Journey of Souls by Dr.
3285.68s: Michael Newton. Very interesting read.
3287.76s: I've read Journey of Souls and Destiny
3289.60s: of Souls. He's written a few books.
3291.48s: Basically, they're just regression
3293.84s: sessions with patients who he's
3295.52s: regressed to their lives between lives.
3299.20s: And anyways, he gets some really
3300.56s: profound answers towards the end of his
3302.48s: book which tend to suggest that the
3305.68s: higher level souls are the ones that
3307.36s: have been around for longer are the ones
3309.60s: creating universes and galaxies and and
3313.20s: changing cells and everything else. So
3315.76s: really interesting. Before the formation
3317.84s: of the physical universe, there was a
3319.68s: vast period during which universes were
3321.84s: not solid but wholly illusionary. You
3325.44s: might say that the universe was a
3326.80s: universe of magical illusions which were
3328.96s: made to appear and vanish at the will of
3331.28s: the magician. In every case, the
3334.32s: magician was one or more isbees. Many
3337.76s: isbes on earth can still recall vague
3340.16s: images from that period. Tales of magic,
3343.04s: sorcery, and enchantment. Fairy tales
3345.60s: and mythology speak of such things,
3347.60s: although in very crude terms.
3351.36s: Each is entered into the physical
3353.52s: universe when they lost their own home
3356.00s: universe. That is when an Isby's home
3359.12s: universe was overwhelmed by the physical
3361.20s: universe or when the Isby joined with
3363.76s: other Isbes to create or conquer the
3366.16s: physical
3368.20s: universe.
3370.12s: That's a little complicated for me. But
3373.52s: all right, we're going to continue. On
3375.44s: Earth, the ability to determine when an
3377.36s: Isby entered the physical universe is
3379.52s: difficult for two reasons. One, the
3381.84s: memory of isbes on Earth have been
3384.08s: erased. Two, isb's arrival or invasion
3387.44s: into the physical universe took place at
3389.44s: different times. Some 60 trillion years
3392.08s: ago, and others only 3 trillion years
3394.72s: ago. Oh, only every once in a short
3397.28s: while, a few million years, an area or
3399.68s: planet will be taken over by another
3401.60s: group of isbes entering into that area.
3405.40s: Huh? Sometimes it will capture other
3407.76s: Isbes as slaves. They will be forced to
3410.80s: inhabit bodies to perform mania or
3412.88s: manual work, especially mining mineral
3415.20s: ores on heavy gravity
3417.80s: planets such as
3420.12s: Earth. Errol says that she has been a
3422.48s: member of the domain expeditionary force
3424.40s: for more than 625 million years. when
3428.32s: she became a pilot for a biological
3430.16s: survey mission which included occasional
3431.92s: visits to Earth. She can remember her
3434.40s: entire career there and for a very long
3436.88s: time before that. She told me that Earth
3439.60s: scientists do not have an accurate
3441.60s: measuring system to gauge the age of
3443.60s: matter. They assume that because certain
3446.00s: types of materials seem to deteriorate
3448.00s: rather quickly, such as organic or
3450.96s: carbon-based matter, that there is a
3453.60s: deterioration of matter. It is not
3456.00s: accurate to measure the age of stone
3457.60s: based on the measurement of the age of
3459.28s: wood or bone. This is a fundamental
3461.92s: error. Factually, matter does not
3464.24s: deteriorate. It cannot be destroyed.
3466.24s: Matter may be altered in form, but it is
3468.72s: never truly destroyed. The domain has
3471.76s: conducted a periodic survey of the
3474.00s: galaxies in this sector of the universe
3476.32s: since it developed space travel
3477.84s: technologies about 80 trillion years
3479.84s: ago.
3481.20s: A review of changes in the complexion of
3483.68s: Earth reveal that mountain ranges rise
3485.76s: and fall. Continents change locations.
3488.56s: The poles of the planet shift. Ice caps
3491.04s: come and go. Oceans appear and
3492.64s: disappear. Rivers, valleys, and canyons
3495.88s: change. In all cases, the matter is the
3499.12s: same. It is always the same sand. Every
3502.32s: form and substance is made of the same
3504.16s: basic material which never deteriorates.
3507.52s: There's a note here by Matilda which
3509.12s: says, "I cannot even begin to imagine
3511.44s: how advanced a civilization may have
3513.68s: become technically and mentally after
3516.40s: trillions of years. Just think of how
3518.80s: advanced our own country has become
3520.32s: compared to only 150 years. Only a few
3523.84s: generations ago, transportation was on
3526.32s: foot, horseback, or boat. Reading was
3528.80s: done by candle light. Heating and
3531.20s: cooking were done over a fireplace. And
3533.60s: there wasn't any indoor plumbing. All
3535.04s: right, folks. That is all I have in the
3537.20s: tank for
3538.60s: today. It has
3540.84s: been an incredibly expanding, you know,
3544.48s: communication that we've read through.
3547.12s: This is uh really kind of hurting my
3550.20s: brain, but I love it so much. I'm a big
3553.68s: fan of universe building, you know,
3555.44s: whether Star Wars or Hitchhiker's Guide
3557.28s: to the Galaxy. So, if this is a giant
3560.00s: hoax or piece of fiction, hats off
3562.08s: because I'm invested heavily and I think
3564.08s: this is uh really
3566.04s: interesting. We're going to stop there
3567.84s: only because I'm I'm I'm kind of getting
3569.52s: saturated and my brain's kind of uh
3571.68s: still trying to process a lot of what I
3573.36s: read and I do want to come back to this
3575.44s: with a fresh perspective.
3577.88s: So, let me know your thoughts on what
3581.68s: has been discussed by Errol and Matilda,
3584.72s: whether that's the out-of body event
3587.04s: that was induced during one of the
3589.84s: invest interrogations or the spiritual
3594.00s: sort of beginnings of the Isbes. This is
3597.04s: all really interesting. And I love the
3599.20s: term Isby, by the way. I think it's so
3602.76s: cool. Uh, thanks for watching, folks.
3606.00s: Definitely check out our Discord if you
3607.92s: want to keep that conversation going. Uh
3609.92s: it's free to join. It's basically a big
3611.92s: chat room where we all get together and
3613.52s: hang out. Check out Area52.shop or the
3617.04s: membership if you want to gain access to
3619.68s: further uh you know videos and other
3622.88s: perks that we have going on there. And
3624.56s: also if you want to you know just
3626.08s: support this channel uh more than just
3628.56s: watching these videos. I appreciate it.
3630.24s: But if not, all good. We'll be back next
3632.56s: week with another read through. in part
3635.32s: three of the alien interview. Thanks so
3638.00s: much and we'll see you then. Peace and
3639.20s: love.
