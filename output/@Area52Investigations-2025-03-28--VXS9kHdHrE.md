3.76s: Hi, my name is Nathan. I'm from North
6.44s: Carolina. My brother and I, looking out
8.80s: the right side of the car, saw these
10.76s: three triangular aircraft of some sort
14.72s: that were floating perfectly still. They
17.60s: were probably 30 or 40 ft higher than
19.60s: the water tower. So, they might have
21.60s: been 100 ft in the air. They were in
23.60s: like a perfect triangular pattern, the
25.36s: three of them. They had a light under
26.88s: each corner and a slightly bigger light
28.88s: under the center in the center. We
31.04s: thought, "This is crazy." Neither one of
32.80s: us said anything when we first saw them.
34.72s: And then we passed them and we got out
36.32s: of sight of them and I was like, "Did
38.00s: you see that?" My brother was like, "Oh
40.16s: my gosh, yeah. Did you see that?"
43.92s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
45.28s: another episode of Debriefed. My name is
47.12s: Chris Ramsey and
48.84s: today we are going to be looking at the
51.60s: final part of the readrough from the
54.08s: Lerta Files. This is a meeting between
57.12s: uh this guy in Sweden who met with an
59.60s: alleged reptilian female by the name of
62.32s: Lerta in the year 99 and 2000. We've
66.00s: gone through their anatomy, their
68.08s: biology, how they communicate
69.96s: telepathically, where they dwell, how
72.40s: they reproduce, where they're from, the
75.44s: origins, this intergalactic war that
77.76s: happened. And finally, we ended with the
80.40s: science part. Now, this was probably the
82.48s: heaviest chapter that we've read so far,
84.56s: but it basically instructed us on what
88.56s: propulsion systems they use, how they
90.72s: navigate through this sort of bubble par
95.48s: universe,
97.16s: multi-layered
99.24s: interdimensional realm. I don't even
101.28s: know how to put it into words, but a lot
103.04s: of you chimed in during that read
106.08s: through with some really, really
108.08s: interesting takes. Many of you have
110.08s: found amazing connections and I look
113.20s: forward to seeing what you guys think of
115.04s: this last part. Before we begin, I would
117.76s: just ask you kindly to suspend your
120.32s: disbelief because belief, as you know,
122.56s: often gets in the way of a good story.
124.72s: And also, if you don't mind, if you
126.32s: enjoy this content, you like the
127.84s: production quality here that I so
130.28s: meticulously craft and and try to create
132.88s: for you guys to tell interesting
134.56s: stories, well then just leave a like,
136.20s: subscribe, and hit the notification bell
139.04s: if you're so inclined. Also, check out
141.36s: our shop at Area52.shop if you want to
143.60s: support the show. We've got a ton of
145.92s: really cool merch. And by the way, I I
148.00s: just want to say this, this merch that I
149.60s: have on area 52.shop shop is all
152.04s: curated, designed, and quality
154.56s: controlled inhouse. This isn't drop
156.88s: shipped by some strange company that I
159.36s: don't know what exactly they're selling
161.20s: you. I know a lot of YouTubers go down
163.28s: that road because it's kind of like they
165.20s: don't have to do anything. I pride
166.88s: myself in doing it all in house uh with
169.12s: my friend Atwan. So, him and I, we
171.56s: design everything that you see in the
173.92s: shop. We quality control it. Uh we check
176.72s: out samples. We're back and forth
178.80s: sometimes for months for even just like
181.12s: a t-shirt or a shirt. So, if you guys
184.48s: want some good quality clothing and
187.72s: accessories and also want to help out
190.32s: the channel and, you know, support us
192.16s: here at Area 52, check that out at
195.56s: area52.shop. Folks, we paid the bills.
198.80s: Who's ready to get roasted by a lizard
202.12s: lady? She's been quite the sassy little
206.32s: uh reptilian. I will say I wonder if
208.48s: they're all this condescending in real
211.28s: life. They probably have some type of
213.76s: superiority complex among them. I just
216.24s: wonder
217.32s: if within their own society if they
221.12s: treat each other with
223.80s: such disdain. And also it makes you
226.96s: wonder like there probably is some
228.40s: faction down there that is like
230.00s: pro-human and then there's like an
232.12s: antihuman. Yeah. I just I really hope
234.72s: that within this we find a little bit
236.80s: more out about their culture. I do enjoy
239.36s: the science. I think it's fine, but
241.12s: honestly, most of that stuff goes over
242.80s: my head. So, we got one last science
245.28s: question to get through from Ola K, as
248.24s: he calls himself, and then we're going
250.56s: to move we're going to move on. So, here
252.32s: we go.
254.20s: Question. Only one last question. At our
257.36s: first meeting in December, you made it
259.20s: quite clear that you didn't want to
260.80s: discuss scientific and paranormal
263.08s: concerns. Why the openness
266.52s: now? Great question. Answer. The last
269.44s: time I saw really no necessity in
271.92s: overburdening you with facts of that
274.16s: kind, and now you were obviously
277.56s: overburdened. Therefore, I have I had
280.16s: preferred only to mention these topics
281.92s: in a peripheral sense. Apparently,
284.56s: however, some of my performances today
286.88s: have set youth to thinking about your
289.20s: world, something that can't be all bad.
293.60s: And by the way, your human scientists
295.36s: will tend to regard my comments as
298.36s: humbug. And I see no great danger in
301.04s: spreading this information widely. No
303.04s: one will pay much attention to it. By
305.04s: the way, the words of the people who
306.88s: have characterized me as a creature of
309.92s: evil, have their basis in belief in
312.40s: occult powers and magic, both of which
315.08s: things do not exist. There is no magic,
319.28s: only highly developed science. And
321.52s: everything that you label as magic is
323.68s: only a part of science. If you would
326.32s: only comprehend that, then you would be
328.56s: a step ahead in your development. My
331.12s: openness on the issue ends here. pose
334.64s: other questions,
337.08s: please.
338.76s: Okay, I will say that again, this is
343.12s: kind of convenient that she's like,
344.64s: "Well, it's all too complicated for your
346.24s: meager minds, and you guys are just
347.84s: going to disregard it as being woo woo,
350.00s: and woo woo doesn't exist. It's all
351.76s: science." I mean that all sort of makes
354.56s: sense that it all sort of cancels each
356.40s: other out nice and neatly where if you
358.88s: question it, you are someone denying it
362.88s: and therefore inferior and if you
365.52s: understand and grasp it, then you are
367.28s: supporting her. So from a creative
369.52s: writing standpoint, this kind of fills
371.36s: in a lot of plot holes. But who knows,
373.68s: you know, maybe if this was actually
375.84s: true, this is potentially what that
377.60s: would sound like also, right? So we got
379.60s: to keep an open mind here. Question.
381.68s: Good. Let's talk about UFOs. Can you
385.44s: explain to me how our governments came
387.60s: into possession of UFO material to the
389.92s: point that they could start their own
391.36s: projects? Did it have anything to do
393.84s: with the Roswell incident? Let's go. Now
397.68s: we're talking about some some actual
399.36s: crash retrieval stuff. Answer, yes. But
402.72s: that accident was not the first one. I
405.44s: am no historian. I am studying only your
407.92s: current behavior. So my knowledge about
409.52s: those events in your history is
411.44s: presumably not very
413.96s: extensive. I will try to explain to you
416.64s: what I know about those things which
418.40s: happened at that time. Let me think
420.40s: about it for a
421.72s: second. In the years 1946 to 1953 in
426.16s: your time scale, there were five cases
429.12s: where extraterrestrial ships crashed to
431.28s: the surface of the earth. In that crash,
433.60s: which you call the Roswell incident,
436.00s: there was not only one alien ship
437.92s: involved, but two that crashed after a
440.32s: collision in different parts of the land
441.92s: in the west, the one you call
445.40s: USA. You have to know that the ships of
448.00s: this particular species can remain
449.84s: levitating in the air for a particular
452.00s: period of time even though they are
453.96s: damaged. That accounts for the spatial
456.48s: difference in their crash locations.
459.92s: These were indeed not the first crashes,
463.04s: but by that time the second and and the
465.52s: third. Another ship had crashed in 1946,
468.48s: but it was destroyed beyond
471.80s: usability.
473.88s: Interesting.
476.12s: H 46. Wouldn't have that been Trinity.
479.68s: When did the Trinity UFO crash happened?
483.28s: The Trinity UFO crash reportedly
485.28s: happened in August 1945 near San
488.16s: Antonio, New Mexico. I mean, that's more
490.48s: like 1945. Could Lerta be mistaken? But
493.68s: it is interesting. You know, if if a
496.08s: euphologist wrote this paper, then um
499.60s: you know, they might know about the
502.08s: Trinity case. One thing first before the
505.08s: explanation. It certainly sounds
507.12s: ridiculous to you that such highly
509.52s: developed extraterrestrial ships simply
512.16s: crash and that a relatively large number
514.88s: did so in a relatively short amount of
517.40s: time. The explanation for that is
519.76s: likewise more than strange, but it is
522.76s: correct. It does not lie in the ship's
525.52s: drive itself, but rather in the
527.04s: direction of the field to your planet.
529.92s: This species that we are discussing and
531.84s: it always in this time period that this
534.08s: species used a discshaped craft used a
537.28s: propulsion system which ran according to
539.28s: the normal principle of fusion to be
541.68s: sure but one that at that time employed
545.36s: a more than conventional method for
547.44s: field alignment. This method had various
550.88s: advantages but also disadvantages. The
553.92s: repelling field must of course lie in
556.32s: the absolute correct angle to the
558.40s: surface of the earth. This species used
561.28s: an alignment technology in their ships
563.84s: with which the field locked into place
566.32s: all the points of earth's magnetic
568.56s: field. Okay, I love the idea that we're
571.28s: responding to UFO crashes because many
574.64s: skeptics out there will say, "Well, they
576.08s: if they have the technology to bounce
577.52s: around the universe, how are they just
578.88s: simply crashing here on Earth?" Valid,
581.60s: valid questions. But the answers to that
585.76s: might be, you know, multiple either
588.72s: we're taking them down, you know,
591.32s: gravity something or another, um,
595.28s: failure on the engine side. Uh, I mean,
599.20s: who knows? But I like the idea that
601.60s: we're finally getting some sort of
603.04s: explanation. And it has to do with the
605.28s: Earth's magnetic field, which is really
607.84s: interesting because the 4chan
610.96s: whistleblower, if you guys remember, the
613.36s: one that worked on the crash
615.24s: retrievals said that in Mexico
618.24s: particularly, the UFOs now today avoid
622.00s: it like the plague because there are
624.76s: some spots that are just like they'll
627.76s: take down ships. and not sure if that
630.80s: has to do with again the Earth's
632.72s: magnetic field or the fact that there
634.32s: are nuclear test ranges out there, but
636.64s: it's all very interesting. The second
638.32s: thing here, we mentioned some type of
640.32s: alignment
642.04s: technology with which the field locked
644.64s: into place all of the points of the
646.40s: Earth's magnetic field. And they said
648.40s: the repelling field must of course lie
650.88s: in the absolute correct angle to the
652.72s: surface of the Earth. It reminds me of,
654.96s: you know, those magnets that are sort of
656.64s: super positioned where you can just like
658.96s: throw up a video here, but the magnets,
661.52s: you can sort of place them anywhere, but
664.00s: once they're locked in, they kind of
665.44s: stay locked in. What's interesting is
667.20s: that they talk about angle and obviously
669.44s: Bob
670.36s: Lazar has spoken about this and we've
674.24s: seen this in many photos and videos of
676.88s: UFO accounts that prior to the crafts
681.28s: taking off at incredible speeds, they
683.92s: tend to angle themselves at a 45°ree and
687.44s: not necessarily in the direction where
689.36s: they're going just to sort of align
691.92s: perhaps the gravitational amplifiers or
695.12s: whatever it is on the craft.
696.72s: uh in order to take off. It'd be easier
699.52s: with a model. On the bottom side of the
701.20s: disc are the three gravity generators.
703.44s: When they want to travel to a distant
705.20s: point, the disc turns on its side. The
707.60s: three gravity generators produce a
709.36s: gravitational beam. What they do is they
711.84s: converge the three gravity generators
713.68s: onto a point and use that as a focal
715.68s: point. Then they essentially bring them
717.28s: up to power and pull that point towards
719.68s: the disc. the disc itself will attach
722.00s: onto that point and snap back as they
724.88s: release space back to that point. Now
727.12s: all this happens in the distortion of
729.12s: time. So time is not incrementing. So
730.96s: the speed is essentially
732.68s: infinite. Very interesting. Just a few
734.88s: points of you know connection that I
736.80s: thought were worthy of mentioning. Now
738.64s: at that time the species had just
740.32s: arrived on the earth and their point of
742.32s: origin lay on a planet with a more
744.40s: stable magnetic field for which they had
747.12s: developed and aligned their
749.64s: drive. The magnetic field of the earth
752.32s: is not really all that stable. It is
754.64s: subject to cyclical variations and it
757.12s: forms field eddies under unfavorable
760.68s: conditions. Whenever a ship with one of
763.12s: those kinds can we just hold on. What's
764.96s: a field eddy? A field eddy typically
767.36s: refers to a swirling or circular
769.20s: movement within a field of fluid such as
771.52s: air or water. It's similar to a small
774.00s: whirlpool or vortex. In the context of
776.64s: weather, it can describe a localized
778.56s: rotation within a larger system, often
780.96s: influencing local weather conditions.
782.88s: All right. Whenever a ship with one of
785.04s: those kinds of drives gets into a field
787.68s: fluctuation or into an eddi that is too
790.60s: strong, then for a short t short time
793.76s: the repelling field can no longer align
796.40s: itself correctly and the ship glides
798.92s: uncontrolled on its flight path. The
801.92s: drive is operating correctly to be sure,
804.48s: but the field fluctuates in all
806.48s: directions and because of that the ship
808.96s: can crash. In the case from 1947 which
812.48s: you addressed, it is my understanding
814.40s: that one of the ships got caught in a
816.32s: fluctuation. Its field linked up
818.72s: unintentionally with that of its
821.20s: squadron leader and it collided with
823.76s: another ship whereby both of them were
826.00s: heavily damaged. The cause for the
828.08s: magnetic fluctuation at the time was
830.08s: probably an electrical disturbance
832.40s: brought about by a weather event. Both
834.56s: ships crashed as a result. One of them
836.72s: fell near the collision point, the other
839.20s: a hundred of your kilometers or so
841.12s: distant. All occupants were killed in
843.52s: the impact. The thin hall structure of
845.52s: that kind of disc craft is in and of
848.00s: itself not very stable since those discs
851.04s: have not been designed for crashes as
852.96s: well as for flight in a field where
855.36s: there are exterior forces at work. Two
858.08s: things here. One, not all the beings
860.48s: allegedly were killed. So this is
863.12s: according to Colonel Corso who Philip
867.44s: Corso who wrote a book the day after
869.32s: Roswell. Very very interesting book
871.76s: indeed. But it details that when the
875.92s: craft was discovered there was a breach
878.32s: in the hull. Bodies were seen kind of
880.72s: strewn around the craft almost crawling
883.60s: or trying to leave the craft and ended
884.96s: up dying. But one of them survived,
887.04s: climbed this little hill and was trying
889.76s: to get out and the soldiers panicked and
892.24s: sort of lit it up if you know what I
894.40s: mean. But uh yeah, the second thing is
896.88s: that the crafts were actually quite
901.00s: intact where normally a aircraft a a
904.64s: more prosaic aircraft would have been
907.92s: blown to smitherines. Uh these crafts
910.40s: were not. Your human military collected
912.48s: the individual pieces at first until
914.24s: they discovered the whole ships with the
916.00s: dead creatures aboard. Immediately, they
918.32s: classified everything as top secret and
921.28s: brought them into their military bases
923.04s: in order to analyze the drive. The
925.20s: secret endeavor was to set the alien
927.68s: technology in place later against evil
930.40s: enemies of that great country. That is
933.12s: as primitive as it is ridiculous. I
936.08s: believe I remember I don't want to
937.60s: specify exactly your date that it was
939.92s: probably between 1949 and 1952 that
943.60s: there was a rather bad accident during
946.16s: some research being done on one of those
948.48s: wrecks. According to what I heard, what
951.04s: members of my species were told by
953.12s: members of that government, it resulted
955.76s: in an unintentional activation of one of
958.48s: the drives components in the unshielded
961.04s: condition. As a result, for a very short
963.84s: period of time, how should I phrase
966.92s: this? There was an unchecked shift of
970.08s: the environment to a plasmall-like
972.64s: condition, which on the other hand,
974.96s: through a very, very unfortunate
977.88s: accident caused an overturning of the
980.64s: general power field into a magnetic
982.96s: pulse of immense power.
986.88s: Do you have any idea of what kind of an
990.32s: effect a plasma magnetic jolt has when
993.60s: it comes into contact with an
995.88s: organism? No. How should you know
1000.04s: that? Of course you don't. Disturbance
1003.20s: in the structure of the field and bio
1005.44s: electric feedback. Imagine if you will a
1008.64s: human body which is engulfed in bright
1010.72s: flames for three or four of your days.
1013.60s: Those flames apparently do not go out
1016.64s: and they burn the body right down to its
1019.44s: last constituents. Well, then you have
1022.72s: an approximate impression of what
1024.32s: happened. I think that 20 or 30 of your
1026.96s: scientists were killed in that lab. My
1031.08s: goodness. I am not currently familiar if
1033.68s: I've heard of any of such tales that go
1036.72s: back as early as the 50s, the 40s and
1038.96s: 50s. It's very interesting. If any of
1040.88s: you have information on that, I would
1042.72s: love to check it out. We continue with
1044.88s: some more crashes that Lerta talks
1046.48s: about. Two further crashes occurred in
1048.72s: 1950 and 1953 in the water catchment
1052.40s: area of the American continent. Those
1054.64s: ships were able to be recovered from the
1056.56s: crashes relatively intact. The one in
1059.44s: 1953, as I remember, even had an intact
1062.80s: drive core. It was by means of that
1066.00s: device that you saw for the first time
1068.40s: that you had understood the entire
1070.24s: concept fully incorrectly and that you
1072.64s: had reconstructed it fully
1075.48s: incorrectly. Even today, you still don't
1078.08s: have it right. So that's something
1080.16s: that's really interesting because even
1081.92s: back then, you know, in 19 or 2000 or
1084.48s: whatever, they're saying, "Oh, we don't
1085.60s: have it right." That seems to be the
1087.44s: common consensus is that there is this
1089.68s: cold war brewing between all of the
1092.40s: leading powers of the world to
1094.64s: successfully backgineer, control, and
1096.92s: understand this type of propulsion
1099.28s: system or this type of gravitic
1101.48s: manipulation. Until any of us
1104.84s: successfully engineer it, none of us
1107.44s: will be able to
1109.48s: truly harness its abilities. But the
1113.28s: second we do might be a very scary
1115.60s: moment in the history of our human
1118.08s: existence. That species which had built
1120.32s: the ships in the first place, a species
1122.56s: which I, by the way, count among those
1125.04s: who are unfriendly towards you, was
1127.84s: naturally worried about the
1128.96s: investigation of their own technology by
1130.72s: your kind. They did not want, however,
1133.52s: at that early point in time to begin
1135.52s: direct conflict with you. And so they
1137.76s: chose the diplomatic path and came into
1141.12s: contact with that government during your
1143.88s: 1960s. Of course, they did not divulge
1146.24s: the real reasons for their being here,
1148.88s: copper, hydrogen, air, but rather they
1151.36s: pretended to be curious quote unquote
1153.52s: researchers, and offered to show people
1155.60s: the functioning principles of the ship,
1157.52s: whereby they would expect in return some
1160.24s: quote unquote favors. Simple-minded as
1162.96s: you are, you of course agreed to it and
1165.92s: were
1167.72s: deceived. Whoa. Okay, now we're talking
1170.64s: about some interesting stuff. We're
1172.16s: getting into some of John Lear's
1174.64s: allegations and even the Griata treaty,
1177.44s: which was apparently made between
1179.76s: Eisenhower and these aliens. It also,
1182.32s: you know, might bring up the Hollowman
1185.20s: Air Force landing where the creatures
1188.08s: exited the vehicle and they were taken
1190.76s: away and uh met with some government
1193.52s: officials. This is very very very
1196.08s: interesting and I love the intergalactic
1198.72s: diplomacy happening here of I like the
1201.76s: idea that these creatures bleed, that
1204.72s: they aren't perfect. it this gives me
1207.04s: some type of hope for humanity uh that
1209.84s: we you know although inferior might
1212.80s: stand a chance we have their technology
1215.12s: in our possession they don't like that
1217.60s: so they came and said oh um yeah we'll
1220.96s: show you how it works and then John Lear
1223.36s: you know in his document mentioned that
1225.92s: they kind of gave us their
1228.28s: technology
1229.88s: but we realized we couldn't pilot it
1232.80s: without them and then they said oh can
1234.96s: we you know abduct some people and
1236.64s: perform experiments, which is what
1238.08s: they're doing. And as mentioned by Danny
1239.68s: Sheen, we've found these headbands
1242.32s: perhaps from the crash in Roswell, which
1245.04s: when reverse engineered could amplify
1247.12s: our psionic capabilities and and you
1249.68s: know, maybe that helps us control these
1251.36s: crafts a little better. This is all sort
1253.84s: of coming together now.
1256.48s: And uh we came to the conclusion even in
1258.64s: those days that these were the reason
1260.40s: most flying saucers have failed is
1262.64s: because our conclusion was that this
1264.32s: being is part of the guidance system. It
1267.28s: was part of the guide system. That's why
1268.72s: we failed in propulsion and guidance
1271.76s: system of these fine saucers. And we
1273.76s: didn't figure it out. We never figured
1275.12s: it out. We didn't do enough on that
1276.56s: body. I like I'm sorry if I'm pausing
1280.16s: here, but I'm suddenly realizing that
1282.56s: all the work that this channel has done
1284.16s: and all the work that we've done
1285.44s: collectively to look into a lot of these
1288.00s: alleged whistleblowings or alleged
1290.16s: documents or MJ12 or stories and all of
1293.12s: these and and the guests that we've
1294.92s: interviewed are finally coalescing in a
1298.56s: way that is making sense of the greater
1302.00s: picture. Now, mind you, I don't know if
1305.36s: that if that is correct. This could be a
1307.44s: giant scop. This could be fake. This
1309.12s: could be a hoax. This could be whatever.
1310.80s: But rest assured that I will not dismiss
1314.48s: it. I think that this is very
1316.16s: interesting to actually contemplate and
1320.08s: it is a scenario that although unlikely
1323.44s: is there's a nonzero chance that this is
1326.56s: the reality that we live in. We
1328.24s: continue. You gave them raw materials.
1330.48s: You gave them secured locations for
1332.24s: their bases. You gave them access to
1334.16s: your most secret defense data. You gave
1336.80s: them access to your DNA and much more.
1339.84s: And all just to quench your greed for
1342.32s: power and information. The alien
1344.72s: species, of course, quickly noted that
1346.56s: they were dealing with simple-minded
1348.24s: creatures, and they gave you false and
1350.16s: inferior information about their
1352.16s: technology so that they receive much
1354.48s: more out of the collaboration than your
1356.16s: kind do. For example, they gave you
1358.64s: information that the drive can only be
1360.80s: constructed with unstable elements of a
1363.04s: higher ranking number, but they withheld
1366.24s: the information that the field drive can
1368.16s: be constructed with various
1369.60s: modifications to work as well with
1372.00s: stable elements of a lower periodic
1374.24s: number. And generally, that's the way
1377.20s: it's done. Through these half-truths,
1380.08s: they made you dependent on synthesizing
1382.56s: of highnumbered elements and thereby
1385.76s: renewed by their own
1388.12s: technology. Their clues to the
1390.08s: construction of your UFOs were laid out
1392.56s: in such a way that the solution to old
1394.56s: problems caused new problems to arise
1396.96s: simultaneously.
1399.52s: They never told you the complete truth,
1401.68s: but always built in again and again
1403.92s: clever lies which later lead to
1405.60s: technical problems and to your
1407.76s: dependence on them. Whoa, this is
1410.48s: sounding a lot like Bob Lazar here.
1412.84s: However, if I was a government SCOP, a
1417.08s: humanrun government SCOP program, you
1420.32s: know, perhaps I would like to throw the
1422.32s: information out there that element 115
1424.88s: is not actually is required to fly these
1428.56s: crafts when indeed it is. So, is this a
1430.64s: double bluff, a single bluff? Very
1433.12s: interesting. But if true, you know, this
1435.76s: means that the work that Bob Lazar was
1438.64s: doing was essentially throwing him and
1440.96s: the rest of the American government for
1442.64s: a loop in a rat race. Um, you know, that
1445.52s: led essentially nowhere into more
1447.80s: problems. I also find it interesting
1449.92s: that she says that it is possible using
1452.32s: those heavy elements. So it doesn't
1454.48s: actually negate the work that Bob ever
1456.32s: did. But she also says that it can be
1458.72s: done with other things which would
1461.60s: explain why there have been sightings of
1464.00s: these craft sort of collecting water
1465.68s: samples and all and hanging around you
1467.92s: know uranium mines especially uh like in
1471.28s: Rua Zimbabwe. There was a massive
1473.12s: uranium mine there when that happened.
1476.28s: So it would make sense.
1482.60s: Okay, I'll be I'll be frank. I did not
1485.60s: expect to be this excited about this
1490.24s: document. Like, I mean, I was excited.
1491.76s: It was fun to get through, but now this
1493.36s: is all of a sudden becoming plausible. I
1496.32s: don't know. Let me know what you guys
1498.32s: think. And by the way, if you're CIA and
1500.80s: you're watching, leave a like,
1503.44s: subscribe. In the last years of your
1506.08s: 1970s and your early 1980s, it finally
1509.44s: came down to various events between the
1511.52s: alien species and the human government.
1514.32s: I don't want to go into detail here
1516.40s: since there is much that even I am not
1518.96s: exactly sure of. The whole thing lay in
1521.52s: the context with some new or better said
1523.84s: the old technical problems with your own
1525.76s: self-constructed ships whose camouflage
1527.84s: and drive partially failed to function
1529.92s: in test flights in the open. Because of
1532.48s: that, the function of secrecy was
1535.48s: threatened. Your military and your
1537.68s: politicians slowly, very slowly, came to
1541.76s: the conclusion after more than 20 years
1544.08s: of this that they had been deceived by
1547.28s: that alien species. Multitudinous in
1549.84s: congruities and the overstepping of
1551.92s: bounds of the treaties by both sides
1554.40s: finally led to an altercation between
1557.04s: you and the extraterrestrials which
1559.16s: culminated in the liftoff of three of
1562.16s: the alien aerial objects through a
1564.96s: special, how do you say it? EMP
1568.24s: electromagnetic pulse weapon and a
1570.96s: military skirmish at one of their
1572.88s: underground installations. Hold on. Now
1575.36s: we're talking about Dulce.
1577.68s: Now, we're talking about this alleged
1580.16s: underground altercation that happened at
1583.04s: a secretive military base once we found
1586.08s: out what was going on. So, is Lasserta
1589.84s: is the person who wrote this just a big
1593.36s: fan of Euphology following in the
1595.60s: footsteps of Phil Schneider and Bill
1597.60s: Cooper and Bill Moore and all these
1600.00s: other guys? Or are all these people
1603.44s: telling the truth? You know, the former
1605.36s: is more likely if you're going to aams
1607.60s: razor it, but the latter is not to be
1609.44s: completely thrown out the window. As a
1611.20s: consequence of these attacks, the alien
1612.88s: species ultimately withdrew from all
1615.28s: contact with you and was understandably
1617.28s: more angered about your kind. Therefore,
1619.84s: I count these extraterrestrials among
1621.84s: the three groups who are hostile towards
1623.76s: you. And while the other two are more
1626.00s: occupied with their own business, among
1628.08s: them waging a cold war for dominance on
1630.48s: your planet, your old quote unquote
1632.80s: friends and partners are preparing to
1635.04s: supply themselves finally with the sole
1637.12s: and absolute dominance over raw
1639.12s: materials and human
1641.72s: DNA. At the moment, it is probably true
1644.64s: that they lack some of the technical
1647.00s: possibilities and the large amount of
1649.20s: forces which they need in order to
1651.04s: achieve their goals directly. In spite
1653.12s: of that, we are counting on negative
1655.12s: actions, possibly ever of a more subtle
1659.08s: kind against you in the next few years
1663.04s: or decades. Whoa. Okay. So, they're
1666.40s: gearing up. They're coming to attack.
1668.24s: They're getting ready, you know, but
1669.84s: maybe I I don't know. This is all
1671.76s: sounding a little wacky and zany. I will
1675.36s: also say that the more I read this, the
1678.08s: more I I kind of part ways on on two
1680.88s: distinct and and opposite paths here.
1683.12s: Either one path where holy crap, what if
1686.32s: this is real, right? What if? That's an
1688.40s: amazing thought experiment and fun to
1691.52s: think about. But the other side is if I
1694.64s: was a government trying
1697.32s: to, you know, false flag attack its own
1700.80s: citizens in the future by way
1703.32s: of a potential quote unquote alien
1707.52s: threat using reverse engineered
1709.76s: technology and and you know, sort of the
1712.64s: whole project blue beam type thing. I
1715.04s: may insert
1717.20s: documents like this and quote unquote
1720.60s: whistleblowings on sites like 4chan,
1723.20s: Reddit or other conspiratorial websites
1726.48s: in order to further the
1731.08s: psychological landscape that I' I've
1734.24s: been laying begin to implant this idea
1736.80s: within the population that there might
1739.20s: be some type of alien threat. Now couple
1741.28s: that with what's currently happening
1743.84s: with OAP, ATIP, Arrow and the government
1746.88s: and how oh we have threats from another
1749.20s: planet. We have to you know what I mean?
1751.60s: I urge my
1753.64s: listeners to be on
1756.44s: guard. Do not take any of this as the
1759.52s: truth. Don't dismiss it and be aware
1764.00s: that there could potentially be some
1766.80s: type of human manipulation behind all of
1768.72s: this as well.
1770.40s: equally as interesting and doesn't make
1772.72s: it untrue. These could be
1775.80s: halftruths. I love this stuff. All
1779.04s: right, here we go. Question. Will the
1782.48s: other extraterrestrial species undertake
1784.56s: nothing against these warlike actions?
1786.80s: Specifically, something ought to be on
1788.80s: Earth for the more highly developed
1791.16s: species. Answer, you're wrong there.
1794.84s: Specifically for the more highly
1796.80s: developed species, there is simply at
1798.80s: the very least your
1800.44s: fate. You are animals for them. Animals
1803.52s: in a very large lab. Understandably, an
1806.48s: alien intervention on your planet would
1808.32s: disturb their project, but I don't think
1810.32s: that they accept a confrontation with
1812.40s: other species for it. Many of them could
1814.88s: look for another research planet for
1816.56s: themselves, or they could study over a
1818.56s: long distance your behavior and your
1820.76s: consciousness/awareness. Since crisis an
1823.04s: uh situations could have an attraction
1826.00s: for their studies, whenever you people
1828.40s: take a look at an antill and another
1830.64s: person comes along and steps on that
1832.40s: antill, what do you do? You go on your
1835.76s: way or you research for another antill
1838.88s: or you observe the ants in their crisis
1841.20s: condition.
1842.80s: But would one of you, even though he
1844.88s: were larger and more powerful than the
1846.72s: one who stepped on the antill in the
1848.64s: first place, defend the meaningless
1850.76s: ants? No. You have to imagine for
1853.76s: yourself the viewpoint of the more
1855.20s: highly advanced creatures. You are the
1856.96s: ants. Don't expect any help from them.
1858.88s: Whoa, hold on a second. Disagree. Hard
1861.76s: disagree, Lerta. You
1864.28s: coldblooded lizard lady. You have no
1866.72s: idea how empathetic human beings can be.
1869.68s: Thank you very much. I if I saw somebody
1873.00s: destroying any natural habitat of any
1876.72s: other living creature, I would like to
1878.56s: think that I would indeed, if not step
1881.12s: in, at least speak up. Do you disagree?
1883.68s: Let me know. Of course, we would ask for
1885.60s: help when it became clear that your old
1887.68s: partners were ganging up on you. Some
1889.60s: members of that human government are
1891.44s: fully aware of our existence, also
1893.44s: partially owing to an old religious
1895.28s: basis. For example, there is a gigantic
1898.00s: partially underground building in the
1899.60s: capital which is totally dedicated to my
1903.68s: species and that also has a direct
1906.40s: approach to an elevator shaft and to an
1909.44s: underground system in this building.
1911.60s: Partial meetings have taken place and do
1913.84s: take place between us and humans. We
1916.80s: have passed on information to you in the
1918.64s: last few years. According to what I
1920.40s: know, we will keep ourselves as far away
1922.64s: from the conflict as we can. You ought
1924.88s: to learn to solve your own problems
1926.32s: yourselves or to become intelligent
1928.16s: enough never to create those kind of
1930.28s: situations. What will come and who will
1932.80s: possibly place themselves on your side,
1934.80s: only time will tell. I really do not
1937.44s: want to make any indications about that.
1940.68s: Okay, Lerta playing the neutral card
1944.16s: here, not getting involved, saying that
1946.24s: we should learn our own lessons. And you
1948.16s: can't really blame her. You know,
1951.20s: there's a probably a reason they've
1952.56s: survived so long. was probably staying
1954.56s: out of conflict and underground. Lerta,
1957.12s: if you're watching this, I would love to
1959.36s: have a sit down with you as well. I
1961.28s: would love to talk to you about all of
1963.04s: this stuff. Please reach out to me and u
1966.56s: let's get a conversation going and
1968.24s: perhaps you'd be surprised at how much
1969.76s: we may have evolved since you last spoke
1972.16s: with uh with this gentleman. I have here
1974.64s: five prints of different UFOs which
1976.80s: claim to show UFOs. Can you take a look
1978.72s: at the pictures and tell me which of
1980.08s: them actual extraterrestrial aerial
1982.08s: craft can be seen? Interesting. I really
1984.24s: wish we had these pictures, but that is
1985.92s: cool. Answer. I can try it. You pose
1989.36s: many questions to me today which even I
1991.36s: cannot answer unequivocally. Don't
1993.68s: overestimate my knowledge. I'm no expert
1995.76s: in alien technology and the construction
1998.08s: of extraterrestrial ships to be sure.
2001.28s: There are mostly some technical details
2003.52s: and peculiarities about genuine UFOs
2006.48s: with whose help one can easily
2008.80s: differentiate them from natural
2010.48s: phenomena or h human forgeries. You
2013.60s: falsify sometimes the pattern of genuine
2015.60s: ships. Therefore, it is not so easy
2017.68s: simply with absolute certainty to
2020.00s: identify an object. I'll try it. Show me
2022.88s: the photos. Here's a comment by Ole.
2026.48s: uh she considered the pictures
2027.84s: respectively for only a couple of
2029.92s: seconds and then sorted out photos 1,
2031.84s: three, and
2033.32s: five. That's an interesting detail to
2035.92s: put in there. These three pictures here
2037.92s: are obvious counterfeits or air
2040.08s: identifications. In one picture, it
2041.76s: certainly seems to me that a real
2043.28s: existing ship of an alien species was
2045.12s: adapted for a small model here. It lacks
2047.84s: important characteristics which are tied
2049.52s: in with the technically and physically
2051.28s: associated field. Generally speaking, a
2054.24s: picture is all the more fake the clearer
2057.04s: the outline and the colors are. Because
2060.16s: a levitating ship is generally hidden in
2062.88s: a shifted field condition that even
2064.88s: distorts the colors or forms according
2067.60s: to alignment. It might perhaps sound
2070.24s: strange, but hazy and spectrally shifted
2073.20s: photos are sometimes to be interpreted
2075.68s: as an indication for a possibly
2079.40s: authenticity. Whoa.
2082.56s: That's cool. Again, just sort of echoing
2086.72s: what many UFO observers have said in the
2089.52s: past is that if there is a gravitational
2091.84s: distortion around this craft, it will
2095.32s: undoubtedly skew any type of attempt of
2099.60s: photography. By the way, this object is
2101.92s: floating above the water. If it were a
2104.00s: genuine ship, we would have to see in
2106.64s: any case either a trrow or a swell on
2111.12s: the surface. Since the surface is flat,
2113.76s: it is obviously not a genuine ship. In
2116.88s: my opinion, none of these three pictures
2118.96s: show genuine objects in flight or UFOs.
2122.56s: Here in this picture, I see above all no
2125.20s: artificial object in flight. It seems
2127.68s: much more to deal with only a light
2129.92s: reflex in your simple optical cameras.
2132.72s: You really ought to be intelligent
2134.16s: enough not to fall for a mixup like
2136.00s: that. When your general public chases
2138.24s: counterfeits and frauds for a long time,
2140.48s: then they will presumably discover too
2142.48s: late what is really going on in front of
2144.16s: them in their atmosphere.
2146.60s: Okay, so we have a photo here. I'm going
2150.16s: to pull it up. This is interesting. No
2152.56s: way. That is crazy because this is a
2155.84s: famous UFO, alleged UFO landing in March
2160.08s: of 1974.
2162.16s: Uh the caption for this reads, uh this
2164.40s: was taken by a French medical doctor
2166.08s: that remained anonymous on March 23rd,
2168.68s: 1974 in Tav in the department in
2173.48s: Var. During a major UFO flap over
2176.00s: France, skeptics doubted the picture on
2177.60s: the ground that the luminous rays cannot
2179.84s: end like this. Of course, they do not
2181.60s: normally, but the skeptics simply forgot
2183.76s: to consider that these are not luminous
2185.60s: rays, but light emissions by ionized
2187.92s: air. I mean, that is a beautiful
2192.32s: beautiful image. I as a as someone who
2194.88s: is into film photography or at least
2198.00s: getting into film photography, you know,
2199.92s: one of
2200.76s: my biggest life goals is to capture a
2204.64s: flying saucer uh on film. Not for proof,
2208.64s: not for evidence, just for the beauty,
2210.40s: the sheer beauty of these crafts and
2212.48s: like the impossibility. And also
2214.48s: something
2215.48s: about, you know, this prosaic
2218.96s: technology, this film mixed with the
2222.96s: pinnacle of technology and sort of
2225.68s: coming together. I think it's just
2226.88s: really beautiful. So that's the photo
2229.20s: we're talking about here. This one seems
2232.36s: genuine. At least it displays the
2234.64s: necessary characteristics. I would
2236.24s: assign it at first glance to an alien
2238.32s: species who have been visiting your
2239.76s: planet for the last 35 years or so. The
2242.16s: object itself is metallic and
2244.04s: discshaped. Certainly, it is distorted
2246.32s: in form and color by means of a field
2248.56s: effect. These four white long quote
2251.36s: unquote processes on the underside of
2253.44s: the ship itself portray a kind of quasi
2256.68s: gravitational light manipulation. I.e.
2259.92s: the universal force field is being
2261.84s: shifted in the direction of a simulated
2264.60s: gravity. Actually, it is not a genuine
2267.76s: light. It is mostly not a genuine light.
2269.84s: Whenever you see illuminating UFOs, but
2272.00s: a special strongly charged form field
2276.48s: which manifests itself in the space that
2279.12s: matter inhabits as a quasi light. The
2282.32s: reason for the activation of this
2283.60s: special high energy system in an
2285.60s: atmosphere is not completely clear to
2287.36s: me. It's possible that it is a kind of
2290.00s: investigating or influencing of the
2292.88s: environment.
2295.20s: In any case, it is terribly careless of
2298.80s: that species to allow this technology to
2300.96s: be photographed by humans. Well, I guess
2303.28s: that most of you just plain don't
2305.04s: understand it. And those who do will not
2307.28s: say anything about it to the general
2309.44s: public.
2311.24s: Whoa. Kind of corroborates the sighting.
2313.76s: Kind of corroborates uh you know what
2315.68s: the initial thoughts of that were. Very
2319.16s: cool. Here is uh photo number four. Pet
2324.52s: Rashe in
2326.76s: Belgium. Oh, this is interesting. This
2329.68s: is really interesting that this one was
2331.76s: brought up. There's a bit of a backstory
2333.92s: with this particular
2336.84s: photo. The person who originally took
2340.40s: this during the Belgian UFO flap, okay,
2343.84s: there was a Belgian known as the Belgian
2345.60s: wave in the '9s. There was this insane
2349.52s: wave of triangular crafts being spotted
2352.80s: throughout Belgium by actual
2357.08s: military, police, air force. A picture
2360.56s: was taken by a photographer named um
2363.68s: Patrick Marishal. This photo quickly
2366.40s: became an iconic image of the Belgian
2368.48s: UFO wave and was widely circulated in
2371.44s: books and documentaries and news media.
2373.28s: It was often praised as like definitive
2375.60s: proof. So 21 years later, apparently the
2380.32s: person who took it confessed in 2011
2385.20s: that it was indeed a hoax. But the story
2388.64s: goes a little deeper for those who are
2392.32s: willing to follow me on this. Subsequent
2395.44s: interviews, Patrick uh seemed to walk
2397.60s: back or soften his confessions. He
2400.56s: stated that he was under a lot of
2403.44s: pressure and he also claimed that the
2405.20s: media distorted his
2406.84s: comments. Many experts agree that the
2409.44s: light in this photo would be very hard
2411.60s: to hoax, nearly impossible. If you're
2414.32s: out there, I would love to have the
2418.48s: opportunity to interview you about this
2420.32s: photo. Now, let's talk about what Lerta
2423.76s: thinks about this photo. This is in fact
2426.40s: a genuine aerial object. It is no way
2431.16s: extraterrestrial. Triangular aerial
2433.36s: objects in flight are simply not used by
2435.44s: alien species or not in this form at
2438.24s: least. That streamlined kind of form is
2440.40s: a human concept. It is one of your own
2442.56s: secret military projects that you build
2444.64s: with the help of immature alien
2446.80s: technology. Technology that was handed
2448.56s: over to you by the extraterrestrials
2450.08s: during the 60s and 70s. Generally, the
2452.72s: form of the hull for a genuine
2455.04s: extraterrestrial ship is of no
2457.16s: consequence. For inside the field
2459.36s: itself, there are no exterior forces
2461.76s: that have any effect there. In general,
2464.08s: the ships have a rounded off form and
2466.72s: they are built without hard edges, a
2468.88s: disc or a cylinder so that the field can
2471.76s: flow more easily. Your projects decree
2474.56s: that along with the alien drive field,
2476.48s: there are also uh there also be a
2478.56s: conventional jet engine system.
2480.44s: Therefore, they are always triangular
2483.44s: and built thus with streamlining in
2486.00s: order to be steerable with this
2488.00s: primitive recoil principle. So
2490.56s: interesting. This is getting really,
2492.96s: really interesting. Wow. Even the 4chan
2495.68s: whistleblower mentioned that triangular
2498.00s: crafts do not exist. Now, that's a bold
2500.72s: statement. For many of you who listen to
2502.24s: that, you said, "What is he talking
2503.36s: about?" Of course, TR3B, there's these
2505.44s: other triangular uh shaped crafts that
2507.20s: we've witnessed in the past. But I think
2509.36s: what he meant was that these ships
2511.68s: aren't extraterrestrial. There's not
2513.12s: they're not something that they've
2514.72s: observed. And then if we look at the
2516.48s: Immaculate Constellation document which
2518.96s: was added to Congress as an official
2522.84s: statement, they had also mentioned that
2525.92s: these triangular crafts were ARV or
2528.48s: alien reproduction vehicles. So
2531.96s: cool. In the example here, the ship
2534.56s: glides above all on its genuine field
2537.28s: drive. Do you see the distortion in the
2538.72s: quasi light in the rotating cylinders?
2541.04s: That is an
2542.28s: unmistakable indication for the
2544.72s: authenticity of the photo. But why, you
2547.44s: might ask, are there four cylinders?
2550.08s: That's unusual. Even the interval seems
2552.24s: to be incorrect. The coloring is very
2554.08s: dark and the interior optical distortion
2556.08s: is very noticeable. Presumably, a
2558.72s: reconstruction of the original system by
2560.72s: your scientists. Since the alien species
2563.44s: has just not given you any more
2564.96s: information since the disagreement, they
2566.96s: are rebuilding the system
2568.32s: single-handedly without actually being
2570.56s: able to understand what kind of
2572.00s: dangerous thing they are
2573.64s: doing. Both of the forward cylinders are
2576.32s: too close to to each other. They will
2578.88s: definitely flow into each other. The
2581.12s: color shows me a powerful residual
2583.12s: radiation. It was probably the case that
2585.52s: high elements were used again as
2587.92s: customary for the shifting.
2590.40s: It is in any case very dangerous to be
2592.32s: unshielded in the vicinity of the field.
2594.40s: Did the person who took the photo
2595.84s: display any kind of radiation and burn
2598.28s: damage? To me, this has got to be the
2601.28s: most interesting portion of this
2604.80s: four-part series by far. I am enamored
2607.92s: right now. I am completely
2610.12s: enthralled. Question, I don't know.
2612.96s: Where do these military UFOs come from?
2614.64s: From the United States? Answer, yes. I
2617.28s: think generally that's true. from the
2619.28s: western
2620.60s: continent. Question, why do they fly
2623.28s: over thickly populated areas of Europe?
2626.32s: This photo comes from Belgium that
2628.16s: doesn't make sense. Can you explain?
2630.24s: Answer: Why is it that only I am able to
2633.84s: explain strange human deeds? It's
2636.24s: possible that these are long-d
2637.52s: distanceance tests or tests with
2638.88s: electromagnetic camouflage systems. The
2641.28s: old enemy of the American nation is on
2643.52s: this side of the world. So why wouldn't
2645.36s: they test the here at home? They've had
2648.96s: enough time to have had their ships
2650.64s: crossing back and forth. Maybe they have
2652.80s: aroused too much observation there. With
2655.36s: one of those kinds of unstable field
2657.12s: structures, as your photo indicates, I
2659.36s: consider it somewhat improbable that
2661.28s: that that ship is capable of making a
2663.60s: flight of that length over the ocean.
2665.76s: It's possible there is a test station
2667.52s: here on your continent. Unfortunately, I
2670.48s: don't know anything about it.
2671.76s: Interesting. Saying that there might be
2673.52s: some secret military base in the
2675.52s: European continent. I don't doubt it.
2678.20s: Probably. Question. Many readers of the
2680.72s: first transcript have posed the question
2682.40s: how your original contact contact with
2684.56s: EF came about. I already know the story
2687.12s: from your narratives, but could you
2688.80s: repeat it here once again for this
2690.64s: volume and for the new
2692.60s: transcript? So, this mentions the
2695.28s: meeting between EF. EF is a person who
2697.76s: set up this meeting between Olo and
2700.32s: Lerta, of course. Now, the story began
2703.52s: about two of your years ago here in
2706.56s: Sweden. I have been strongly interested
2708.56s: in your species and your behavior since
2710.24s: my youth. I had already studied your
2712.24s: literature at that time as well as
2714.20s: possible. Naturally, it is not easy in
2717.04s: my homeland to come into possession of
2718.88s: human books. But since my group or
2721.12s: family stands in a higher ranking order,
2723.36s: I was able to gather some material
2725.04s: together and sometimes to speak with
2726.80s: others of my kind who have already been
2728.80s: in contact with you. I was ve really
2731.76s: very curious about your species. And as
2734.16s: soon as I was allowed to come to the
2735.60s: surface, I attempted to assemble more
2738.00s: information immediately. Above all, it
2740.24s: was expressly forbidden for me to
2741.84s: commence direct contact with humans
2744.24s: because in my position at that time,
2746.32s: there existed no necessity for doing so.
2748.80s: very cool that she's just kind of
2750.56s: curious about humans in the way that you
2755.56s: know a young person might be curious
2758.48s: about extraterrestrials.
2762.56s: It was in your year 1998 when I was on
2765.76s: my way further north from here in the
2767.84s: remote forests in the vicinity of the
2770.72s: entrance to my world and was looking for
2773.92s: biological
2775.32s: specimens which we use in order to watch
2777.84s: over environmental pollution and
2779.44s: destruction of your flora and fauna
2781.92s: statistically by your own kind. At that
2785.12s: time I was already on the return path to
2787.68s: the entrance. We can even orient
2790.08s: ourselves more easily, by the way,
2792.08s: through our senses to the Earth's
2793.92s: magnetic field. And already in the
2796.16s: vicinity of the large lake, when much to
2799.04s: my
2800.04s: surprise, I came across a cabin in the
2804.36s: woods. In this cabin, I sensed a human
2809.16s: consciousness/awareness. It was EF.
2811.44s: Actually, I had no permission for
2813.44s: contact with another species. But by the
2815.76s: same token, I had set in place my
2817.92s: mimicry capability quite successfully
2820.16s: prior to this, even with larger groups
2822.64s: of you. I had never ever come across a
2825.28s: human being when I was alone. Now, let's
2828.64s: call it primitive
2830.36s: curiosity. I wanted to talk with a
2832.72s: person in this cabin, and so I knocked
2835.36s: on the door. E opened the door and we
2839.28s: got into an interesting
2840.92s: conversation. His language was not quite
2843.68s: yet common at that time for me, but it's
2847.04s: not all that hard to learn a new
2848.72s: language when one can read the
2850.16s: information in the
2852.28s: consciousness/awareness of the opposite
2855.40s: individual. I simply told him that I
2858.16s: came from a foreign country in the east.
2860.88s: Of course, at that at the time, he did
2863.92s: not really quote unquote recognize who I
2866.64s: was. He was totally convinced that he
2869.20s: was talking with a creature of his own
2871.04s: kind, although it was simply only a
2873.68s: mimicry
2875.16s: image. I love this. This is a cool
2878.32s: story. Since my assignment anyway had
2881.28s: its own goal, an investigation of this
2884.56s: terrain, which was to last for several
2887.20s: days, I visited him in this span of time
2890.48s: three times as a human
2892.76s: person. At first, we talked mainly about
2896.16s: really ordinary things. Later, we got
2898.88s: into religious and physical topics. He
2901.52s: seemed to be impressed by my knowledge
2903.20s: and I was likewise impressed with his
2905.44s: clear thoughts and his for a human being
2909.20s: well-displayed personality structure and
2911.36s: his own
2912.28s: opinions. You really like giving
2914.24s: yourselves over completely to a public
2916.56s: opinion or conditioning as for example
2919.28s: reptilian species are evil and stuff
2921.44s: like that. I steered the conversation in
2923.84s: the direction.
2928.20s: Um, am I the only one wondering if they
2930.72s: hooked up? This sounds like a third date
2933.68s: type of scenario. I don't know. Just
2936.16s: Just throwing that out there. There's
2938.00s: probably a category on the hub. All
2939.76s: right, moving on. Head out of the
2941.60s: gutter, folks. I steered the
2943.04s: conversation in this direction. And EF
2945.44s: said something to the effect that he
2946.96s: believed in alien species and that they
2948.96s: did not have to necessarily be evil, but
2951.04s: perhaps only different than his kind
2953.72s: are. That pleased me at that juncture of
2956.72s: time. Of course, I could not speak
2958.72s: concretely with him about my knowledge
2960.88s: because he wouldn't have believed me. He
2963.04s: would have taken me for a human
2964.72s: practical joker. I cultivated the very
2967.84s: very unusual idea for my kind to show
2971.68s: him my true exterior. something that I
2974.88s: did during our conversation at the
2977.28s: fourth meeting in the
2979.24s: cabin.
2980.92s: Actually, he was predestined for
2983.28s: contact. He was open-minded, honest,
2986.36s: intelligent, not religiously inclined or
2988.88s: conditioned. He lived alone and
2991.40s: isolated, and no one would believe him
2994.16s: should he decide to go public with his
2995.92s: story. I dared to take the step, but
2998.16s: then I had serious doubts about the
2999.68s: propriety of my act, especially when he
3001.84s: reacted
3003.48s: very
3005.56s: violently. He got control of himself
3007.92s: again after a time, and we could finally
3010.00s: talk concretely about definitive,
3012.08s: definite
3013.48s: matters. Now, he had no choice but to
3016.16s: believe me. This was the beginning of a
3018.64s: series of meetings which initially took
3020.40s: place there in the woods, but later took
3022.72s: place in his remote residence. Finally,
3025.52s: he brought you into contact with me. And
3028.56s: for that reason, we are now sitting here
3030.24s: once again and talking about things
3031.84s: which probably won't be believed out
3033.76s: there in human society. Wo. Okay. Always
3038.32s: a little bit fishy was this idea of
3040.72s: meeting with some type of journalist
3042.72s: here to spread information. Although
3045.20s: they did not want to be brought into the
3048.24s: light. They wanted to remain secretive.
3050.48s: Then yet, why are you holding this
3052.00s: conversation? This makes a lot more
3053.36s: sense.
3054.48s: She kind of stumbled into this situation
3058.40s: and her curiosity got the best of her. I
3061.20s: feel like she's hoping no one will
3063.88s: believe what she's saying and that's why
3066.32s: she keeps repeating no one's going to
3067.60s: believe it. No one's going to believe
3069.40s: it. I don't I think she underestimates a
3072.32s: lot of us out there. Super
3074.76s: interesting. This is wild. I Anybody
3077.60s: else want to see like a major motion
3079.12s: picture done? This would be so cool.
3082.52s: question. You said you would not have
3084.80s: had permission at that time for contact
3088.08s: with human
3089.16s: beings. Do you now then have permission
3092.00s: to talk with EF and me about all these
3094.00s: things and even to make this
3096.00s: scientifically public? Answer, yes. That
3099.20s: is difficult to explain and for you to
3101.36s: understand. Let's just say I find myself
3103.36s: in the position now to arrange this
3105.04s: permission without having to take into
3106.64s: account any consequences. In this
3108.56s: position, I am quasi immune against
3111.52s: certain restrictions. Let's look at it
3114.08s: that way. Yes. Question. If other people
3117.68s: want to come into contact with your
3119.20s: kind, do they have a chance to do
3123.24s: so? Answer: generally not. We avoid
3126.88s: contact with you and we operate on the
3128.48s: surface only in remote areas and there
3131.36s: we use we use mimicry techniques in case
3133.92s: we should meet some people. that I am
3136.40s: talking with you now does not mean that
3138.00s: others will follow my example. It goes
3140.08s: without saying that you could try to
3141.68s: find an entrance to my world and
3143.20s: penetrate your way into there. However,
3146.32s: that can sooner lead to unpleasant
3148.16s: consequences for the
3150.36s: infiltrator. You have next to no chances
3152.88s: on the surface of recognizing us. You
3155.60s: can't even contact us directly. We have
3158.48s: to contact you just as I did with EF.
3161.60s: Those kinds of contacts, however, are
3164.48s: not the rule, but are very rare
3167.96s: occurrences. A nonzero chance that I'll
3171.76s: have a reptilian on this podcast
3174.52s: eventually. Or who knows, maybe I
3176.72s: already have. Untrue. No, I haven't
3180.36s: because they can't be on camera.
3182.80s: Question: Can you describe your
3184.24s: subterranean homeland location? answer.
3187.68s: I can attempt to do so, but I certainly
3189.60s: will not tell you where this place is
3191.20s: located. My homeland lies in one of our
3193.36s: smaller underground settlements to the
3194.96s: east of here. I'll give you some numbers
3197.04s: so that you can make a better impression
3198.96s: for yourself. Just a minute. I have to
3201.28s: try to convert the measurements
3202.32s: approximately into your units. It is a
3204.80s: dome-shaped cavern at a distance of
3207.12s: about 4,300 m from Earth's surface. The
3210.80s: cavern was organized as a colony about
3213.12s: 3,000 years ago. A major portion of the
3215.52s: ceiling structure is artificially
3216.88s: integrated into the rock and the form
3219.28s: was remodeled into an almost elegantly
3221.60s: proportioned and very flat dome with an
3224.40s: oval ground
3225.96s: plan. The diameter of the dome according
3228.56s: to your measures is about 2 1/2 km. The
3232.40s: height of the dome at the highest point
3234.24s: is about 220 m. Underneath that highest
3238.80s: point in every colony there stands a
3241.60s: special whitish gray cylindrical
3243.76s: building a kind of supporting column
3246.80s: which holds the honeycomb net carrying
3250.08s: structure of the dome. This building is
3253.76s: the tallest, largest and oldest in the
3256.56s: entire dome for it is always situated as
3259.68s: the first construction together with the
3261.76s: security of the ceiling. In the
3263.84s: meantime, of course, there were times
3265.36s: when it was complete completed and
3269.24s: reconditioned. That building has a very
3271.60s: special name and religious significance.
3274.16s: We have only one of those columns.
3276.16s: Larger colonies have more columns
3278.00s: according to the construction of the
3280.12s: ceiling. One of the main colonies in
3282.88s: inner Asia has an example nine of those
3286.32s: kinds of supports. But that colony also
3288.88s: has over 25 of your kilome in size. The
3292.88s: central building is generally a center
3294.96s: of religion but also a center for
3297.52s: climate control and a center for the
3299.60s: behavior and the regulation of the
3301.20s: lighting system. We have at our location
3304.40s: altogether five large artificial light
3306.96s: sources which generate your UV light and
3309.76s: its warmth through gravitational
3311.96s: sources. The air shafts and the light
3314.32s: systems from the surface likewise run
3316.56s: through these columns and naturally they
3318.40s: are very intensely
3321.00s: controlled. That's very interesting.
3324.08s: What about their uh sewage? Like where
3327.04s: does that go? Wouldn't it just like
3329.36s: stink under there? Wouldn't that like
3330.88s: where does that air end up going?
3332.88s: Strange question. I know. I get it. But
3334.64s: also, I'm just trying to like poke holes
3336.00s: in this. By the way, we have three air
3338.00s: shafts and two elevator systems there
3340.08s: and even a tunnel connection to the next
3342.00s: main colony, which lies approximately
3344.00s: 500 km to the southeast. One elevator
3346.48s: shaft leads to the cavern near the
3348.08s: surface. The other leads to one of four
3350.16s: depots for the ships. You remember the
3352.56s: cylindrical ships that is naturally
3354.96s: concealed closer to the surface behind a
3356.88s: rocky mountain face. Normally there are
3359.52s: only three ships there. It's a small
3361.72s: depot. The other buildings of the colony
3364.08s: are for the most part concentrically
3366.08s: ordered in oval circles around the main
3368.24s: supporting column and they are without
3370.40s: exception much flatter generally only
3372.72s: between 3 and 20 m tall. The shape of
3374.96s: the buildings is round and domelike. The
3377.04s: color is even differentiated according
3379.84s: to the circle and distance from the main
3382.08s: column. Okay, interesting little uh
3385.60s: descriptions of all of this. To the
3388.16s: north of the column, there is an
3389.60s: additional very large but very flat
3391.92s: round building. This building interrupts
3394.48s: the concentric system of the colony with
3396.32s: its diameter of about 250 m. It is the
3400.08s: artificial sun zone in which specially
3403.04s: illuminated corridors and rooms are
3405.12s: housed. In these locations, very
3407.36s: powerful UV light predominates and they
3409.92s: are used in order to warm our blood.
3412.48s: There is even a medical dispensary and a
3415.12s: meeting room located there. Beyond the
3417.60s: outer ring of the colony, there are
3419.04s: zones in which animals are kept. You
3421.04s: know, we must consume flesh as
3425.48s: nourishment and the gardens in which
3427.60s: plant nourishment and mushrooms are
3429.44s: cultures are cultivated. There is also
3432.32s: hot and cold running water there from
3434.56s: subterranean sources. The power station
3436.96s: is located on the edge of the colony.
3438.80s: The station is driven by fusion as its
3441.12s: base and it supplies the colony and the
3443.76s: suns with energy. My group or family
3447.28s: lives, by the way, in the fourth ring of
3449.76s: the buildings out from the central
3451.52s: support column. So much in such a short
3454.80s: time. To describe to you all the
3456.96s: buildings and their tasks would be going
3458.64s: too far. It is difficult to describe
3460.64s: something like that to you for it is a
3463.20s: completely different set of surroundings
3464.88s: and culture from what you are accustomed
3467.60s: to in your life on the surface. You
3470.48s: really have to see it for yourself to be
3471.92s: able to believe it. I would give a lot
3475.20s: to get a
3476.44s: tour in one of those. Man, that would be
3479.68s: cool. Might be the last thing you end up
3481.84s: seeing
3482.84s: though. Question: Will I myself see it
3485.60s: sometime? Answer: Who knows? Maybe time
3490.08s: brings new
3491.56s: opportunities.
3494.20s: Whoa. Oh, I just got goosebumps. Maybe
3496.96s: that's why we've never heard from this
3498.24s: guy ever
3499.24s: again. Question. How many creatures of
3501.92s: your kind live in this colony? Answer:
3504.80s: Approximately 900. Question. That is the
3507.84s: end of the interview. Do you have any
3509.28s: final messages for the readers of this
3510.88s: transcript? Yes. I am thoroughly
3514.00s: surprised at the many comments to my
3516.16s: words. Of course, I am naturally also
3519.28s: disappointed about the religious
3520.72s: portrayals of me as the enemy which have
3522.96s: been voiced and which have been buried
3525.04s: themselves deeply in your mind. You
3528.00s: should learn to set yourselves apart
3530.00s: from the old conditioning and not to
3532.24s: stand quasi under the control of
3534.48s: something or someone who has already
3537.04s: been gone for 5,000 years. You are after
3540.56s: all free spirits. Those are my final
3545.24s: words. end of
3548.28s: Lucertifile 2. I'm a little sad about
3552.40s: the end of that. I
3555.00s: I you know something in me I had a gut a
3559.12s: negative gut reaction to this being in
3562.80s: the beginning of these
3564.36s: interviews mainly because of her disdain
3566.88s: and her condescending nature. Then
3569.20s: towards the middle, I began
3572.52s: understanding why she felt this way
3575.04s: towards us. And in the
3579.56s: end, I kind of like her. It wasn't
3584.28s: until she mentioned her own sort of
3587.80s: curiosity that I was more taken by this
3592.68s: being because that shows me something
3595.20s: that I can relate to. this genuine
3597.72s: curiosity. The same curiosity that we
3600.48s: are currently experiencing reading about
3602.64s: her kind is perhaps the curiosity that
3607.44s: she displayed when seeing this little
3609.84s: cabin and sensing a presence within it.
3613.52s: I love the idea that she just gave us a
3615.68s: small taste of her
3617.80s: world. And she's absolutely right. you
3620.56s: know, just by even going through the
3623.04s: colonies and columns and the different
3625.88s: areas, it's a lot for us to take in. You
3630.24s: know, I'm currently watching the show
3631.80s: Severance. I don't know if you guys
3633.60s: follow that on Apple TV. It's really
3635.40s: good. Probably one of the best sort of
3637.68s: sci-fi
3639.00s: stories, you know, in a long time, but
3642.32s: it's so mysterious. Like the whole world
3645.04s: itself is just too much to grasp at
3647.20s: once. We get these little and that's
3649.04s: kind of what this feels like. Like if
3651.04s: you were to stumble into a new world
3654.64s: with a new species that had a completely
3657.92s: different culture, religion, and
3659.72s: society, it wouldn't be so easily
3662.72s: relatable to your own. There would you
3664.80s: would have to consume it in small bits
3666.88s: because it's like starting a movie, you
3670.24s: know, halfway in. You're like, "What's
3671.84s: going on? Who are these characters?
3673.12s: Where are we?" I'm very curious to know
3675.52s: your thoughts. I can't wait to read the
3677.68s: comments on this video. I was hoping we
3681.20s: were going to learn a little bit more
3683.60s: about their culture and their
3685.88s: society, and I didn't actually think I'd
3688.72s: get to know Lerta a little bit more on a
3691.76s: personal basis, and that was a fun
3693.28s: surprise. So, if you did enjoy this
3697.76s: content, folks, let me know in the
3699.76s: comments because I would love nothing
3702.16s: more than to bring you more of these
3704.48s: conversations between humans and aliens
3706.72s: that exist out there. I've done my
3709.36s: research and I've compiled quite a few
3710.96s: of them and I think it would be
3712.56s: fascinating to run through them, of
3714.80s: course, with all of you. Folks, thank
3718.48s: you so much for joining me on this
3720.44s: journey. Highly appreciate it. Make sure
3723.44s: to check out Area52.shop if you want to

3729.12s: extra content. We upload weekly vlogs
3731.92s: and we'll see you on the next video.
