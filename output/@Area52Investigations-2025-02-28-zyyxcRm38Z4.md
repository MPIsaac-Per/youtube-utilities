182.96s: pumped about it and see how it's taking
185.84s: shape and how many people are getting
187.48s: involved it it it's it's birthing itself
190.64s: in a way and so you know from download
194.04s: to
195.64s: me saying okay I'm going to take this on
198.40s: and try it to now it's just you know
202.36s: just snowballing it's amazing bigger and
204.36s: bigger and bigger your private
205.84s: information is probably being sold this
208.08s: very moment don't believe me well you're
210.28s: probably being flooded with Spam emails
213.00s: and calls and texts and if you're like
215.64s: me you don't want people knowing where
216.96s: you live or what your financial
218.68s: situation is or what your political
220.64s: views are and these companies can
222.52s: leverage all of that information they
224.44s: can even use that information against
226.52s: you to raise your insurance premiums and
228.60s: that has happened you can actually
230.32s: demand that your name be taken off of
232.32s: these lists now the bad news is that
234.84s: there are hundreds of lists and it's
237.48s: incredibly timec consuming you can put a
239.32s: stop to that
240.36s: and it brings me to today's sponsor
242.24s: incog so with incog basically you sign
244.60s: up you grant them permission to act on
246.36s: your behalf and sit back and watch them
249.00s: do what they do they contact all of
251.36s: these spamming websites and demand that
254.04s: your name be taken off dies lists and if
257.16s: the people refuse guess what incognet
259.16s: keeps demanding until your name is
261.60s: completely gone from all of these
263.76s: nefarious lists on the internet you've
265.84s: even got a really cool dashboard where
267.36s: it shows you the progress on what what's
269.92s: being done what's in the process of
271.68s: being done what's already been done so
273.56s: go to incog
275.08s: docomo or click the link below and use
277.44s: promo code Area 52 to save 60% off your
280.92s: annual plan and watch them defend your
283.68s: privacy month after month all right
286.52s: we'll get there in a second first I want
287.96s: to cover some ground all right because
289.80s: uh the one term that you hear probably
292.76s: the most all right and I had to bring on
295.12s: a real scop expert here to clear this
297.16s: off to clarify this because scop is
299.96s: thrown around so loosely yeah especially
303.20s: in in the UFO Community yeah it's scop
306.80s: and grifter and all these other but scop
309.04s: is a specific one yeah and so I had to
310.96s: clear the air for all you thinking I'm a
312.68s: scop here I might be but he's gonna he's
315.12s: going to be able to tell you I love that
317.80s: you're saying scop and not scops you
321.04s: know I got uh smoked when I was well we
324.08s: call it smoke when they make you do
326.52s: push-ups and sit-ups in the Army if you
328.32s: say something or do something wrong
329.76s: wrong and a way of corrective action and
332.84s: um it comes from when you start to be
335.36s: outside and it's cooler and you get hot
337.52s: and the steam comes off of you you're
339.04s: being smoked right and so um I I we
342.72s: would say as newbies we'd say scops you
345.96s: know and um they were like there's no s
348.84s: there's no scops like cuz we're thinking
351.52s: operations you know no it's just scop
354.44s: it's just scop and that's one of the pet
356.20s: peeves that I have when I talk to people
357.96s: it's like you don't have it yeah exactly
360.08s: there's no Legos yeah I say Legos all it
363.00s: it triggers all the the Lego nerds so
365.36s: the scop Nerds out there are very happy
366.92s: with me yeah uh so yeah tell us
370.16s: exactly um let's start let's start first
372.68s: of all how you got into this program and
374.52s: then we'll get into maybe what exactly
376.56s: you did with this program yeah yeah so
379.96s: um I was looking to join the Army I was
381.84s: training in Ninjutsu in this martial
383.88s: arts and my teacher had a bodyguard
386.32s: seminar and um you know he was talking
389.24s: about hey I used to protect the dollar
391.12s: llama and that was a very specific way
393.72s: you got to be a bodyguard for the dollar
395.68s: Lama right you can't just be like a rap
398.48s: star bodyguard where somebody does
400.20s: something wrong and you just drop them
401.48s: on their head like this is the dollar
403.20s: llama you know so I was really
405.24s: interested in that so I went to the
406.84s: seminar and there was this guy there
408.72s: named Michael Brewer and he's like super
411.32s: awesome guy and I was telling him I was
413.68s: going into the service because I really
415.88s: had some skills and I wanted to use
418.12s: those skills to help my country because
419.92s: it was after
421.12s: 9/11 and he I was like I want to go into
424.08s: the 18 x-ray program which is like the
426.28s: special force you enter knowing that
428.80s: that's what you're going to be and you
429.88s: go through a pipeline and so on and so
431.76s: forth and he was like you know you
433.60s: should really with this ninja background
435.92s: that we have and so on the thing you
437.48s: should do is is scop and that's what I
439.76s: do and I said well what's that and he
441.16s: was like oh it's like psychological
443.32s: operations like psychological warfare
445.28s: and I was like huh and he I didn't know
447.68s: that was a thing he was like yeah you
449.20s: know like like the ninja that's what we
450.72s: did back in the day and like you should
452.52s: try it out and so I was like okay let's
454.44s: do it and he was like in this way of you
456.48s: get hurt trying to go through the
459.28s: Special Forces program then you go back
461.68s: to scop and you'll be hand inand with
464.52s: them you'll go through a lot of the same
466.04s: training and you'll know all of the same
468.20s: people and that good old boy Network
469.88s: you'll start to build those
471.32s: relationships and so then if you don't
473.68s: make it if you decide you want to go
475.04s: over there and you don't make it you're
476.36s: still right there with them you're just
477.88s: in a different capacity and I was like
480.16s: yeah that's a better strategy and this
482.04s: sounds really cool and the more I dug
483.56s: into it the more I was like no this is
485.48s: really where I need to be you know um
488.04s: I'm cerebral and I like to see the depth
490.56s: and how things work and how people's
492.52s: minds are working around specific topics
494.96s: and you know and that's really what I
497.88s: was passionate about and having that
500.04s: ninja background and that ninja
501.68s: connection and the ninja being masters
503.92s: of psychological warfare I was like this
506.32s: would be great for me to transition into
508.36s: and that's how it started so so you got
511.04s: um you were already prepped yes going
513.56s: into that like you you kind of this kind
515.84s: of like fell into your lap a little bit
517.32s: because of what uh you know we talked
519.48s: off camera we'll get into that a lot but
521.28s: there there are so many links between
523.84s: your ninja training yes scop and I found
527.04s: even with magic there's like there's so
528.68s: many and and so you kind of were
530.40s: prepared for this yeah it happens now
533.60s: you're getting trained yeah can you tell
535.64s: us a little bit about what that entails
537.60s: what's scop training yeah yeah so I
539.84s: think that's really what's it's some and
542.20s: we had this drill sergeant which is he
545.40s: was a very unique guy and so I I
547.84s: straight As say I don't know if
549.12s: everybody got the same experience as we
551.40s: had but he really wanted to it two of
553.56s: them actually um they wanted us to
556.16s: experience what it was like to really
558.24s: use sound and manipulation and sleep
562.00s: deprivation and all those things to your
566.04s: power so you can control or manipulate
569.12s: or influence uh different audiences and
572.64s: individuals and so during my training we
576.32s: would have just off-the-wall stuff like
578.88s: you know uh this one drill sergeant that
581.28s: that I'm talking about so you go to
582.80s: regular basic training and then you get
584.88s: from you get done with that and you go
586.28s: to like your Advanced individual
588.32s: training which is AIT which is going to
590.76s: be where you focus on just what you're
592.88s: doing because everybody's a soldier
594.24s: first right so you go through that basic
595.92s: training here's how you shoot a gun
597.64s: here's how you do unit tactics stuff
599.68s: like that and I did that at Fort Benning
601.72s: and then I went to AIT and then you're
603.80s: like okay well now here's what you
606.48s: specifically are going to do as your
607.88s: specialty and that was where the scab
609.92s: training took place and so we have our
613.08s: school day where you actually go to
615.48s: school and learn like what is scop and
617.60s: how do you do it and what are the
619.48s: different words that you use and all
621.76s: that stuff and then we had this drill
623.80s: sergeant this guy would like just
625.40s: manipulate and play with us all the time
627.28s: so times when we thought we had to be
629.56s: done or times that we weren't done and
631.88s: so for instance we get done after our
634.04s: long day we do pt in the morning come
636.68s: back Rush try to scarf something down
638.60s: then go to the schoolhouse then you're
640.16s: sitting in school learning all this
641.64s: stuff all day and then you're like okay
643.72s: we get back and we should be able to go
645.76s: to sleep so that we could be fresh for
647.56s: the next day and then we get back and
649.64s: he'd be like okay we want you guys to go
652.08s: up and make a map of all your rooms and
654.04s: where everything is okay we go up and do
656.76s: that thinking they just need to know and
659.36s: then we bring it back down okay cool we
661.84s: want it to look like this out here on
663.52s: the lawn so go and get all your [ __ ] and
665.44s: bring it out here and set it up this way
667.92s: on the lawn it's like at 6:00 pm. right
670.16s: so we're all like what yeah discouraged
673.48s: and we're so now you got all of us like
675.80s: going up you know to our rooms and you
678.56s: know we do it we we do our AIT in tandem
681.44s: with civil Affairs right so it was civil
684.04s: Affairs guys and S guys there so then
686.36s: we're like pulling all our stuff down
688.12s: and we're setting it up and we're
689.72s: looking at the map and we're doing all
691.28s: of this and it's like now almost 11:00
694.20s: right and so now it's 11:00 and you're
696.44s: like oh man and they're like yeah you
698.28s: guys are going to sleep outside you're
699.92s: going to sleep outside we don't care if
701.60s: it rains tonight it's gonna so now
703.24s: you're trying to deal with that
704.32s: psychologically and then at 11 you get
706.72s: done and they're like all right move all
709.96s: your [ __ ] back inside so really my yeah
714.52s: so then you spend all this time like
716.20s: trying to you know do it then you get
718.40s: all your stuff back inside and then they
720.20s: go into a room close the door and then
722.12s: they'll move [ __ ] around and then
723.32s: they'll come back in the room and have
725.04s: you come back in and be like what's this
726.72s: this doesn't look like your your what
728.76s: you drew in your your map here your
731.04s: strip map and you're like this is not
733.04s: how I left the room and they like shut
735.32s: up everybody get outside we're gonna
736.88s: smoke you guys cuz you know Isler didn't
739.00s: have his stuff ready you know no and so
741.24s: now we're all outside and then we're
742.84s: everybody's mad at me or whoever you
744.84s: know cuz they didn't get it right but
746.28s: really it was just part of the the thing
748.52s: they went into room rearranged it came
750.72s: out and yelled at you because it's not
752.88s: right and you know in your mind but then
755.32s: also maybe you don't because you're so
757.32s: tired so you're like oh you're like did
759.60s: I do something wrong and because you
761.48s: don't know what they did you just know
762.88s: they're saying that it's not right and
765.20s: you're out here and you smoked and now
766.76s: everybody it's all this resentment going
768.56s: on and then you get back in at like 2:
770.76s: in the morning and they're like all
771.96s: right well go ahead and get some rest
774.00s: cuz we got a PT test in the morning
775.76s: we're going to do physical training and
777.36s: we got and if you don't make it you know
779.40s: on your two mile run and this time or
781.20s: whatever we're going to kick you out of
782.56s: here so now you can't sleep so you're
784.48s: like you're like sitting in bed like oh
787.00s: no if I don't pass this test everything
788.72s: is for nothing you know I get I get
790.44s: kicked out of here and then you wake up
792.64s: and you know or if you if you can't fall
794.40s: asleep you wake up you go outside and
796.04s: then they're like all right just do your
797.52s: normal PT and get ready for class and
799.36s: you're like what and they're like yeah
801.72s: there's no PT to no PT just messing with
804.84s: you and you really start to recognize
807.32s: really quickly how things break down how
809.24s: people break down how creating all this
812.24s: discourse in people's mind and their
814.48s: routines really or make giving them hope
817.20s: like oh yeah when you get home tonight
819.12s: we're not going to mess with you we're
820.60s: going to give you as much sleep as
822.08s: possible because we messed with you last
823.64s: night and then you get back and they
825.32s: mess with you and then you're like whoa
827.16s: or you get or they're like we're going
828.60s: to mess with you when you get back and
830.16s: then you get back and they don't mess
831.60s: with you and you're like I don't know
833.44s: what I don't know what's reality and
834.84s: what's not reality here that is uh I
838.12s: mean all to make you uncomfortable right
840.72s: that seems like what it is so what's
842.64s: interesting is that I mean my my father
845.76s: did s up as well for uh the Canadian
848.00s: military and um you know I remember my
851.08s: upbringing and there's a lot of what
852.88s: you're saying that goes He Was preparing
856.20s: you I I I'll tell you after the podcast
858.88s: but it's like yeah a lot of similarities
862.20s: of the uh psychological warfare um very
865.44s: very interesting because what do you
867.76s: think is the purpose of that though is
870.56s: it just to prepare you for those
872.56s: situations or is it to break you like
874.80s: what's what do you think is the the goal
876.80s: stress inoculation right so getting a
879.36s: person to understand what it's like to
881.28s: be that level of discomfort um and then
883.92s: to understand how to be able to push
886.12s: through that and and work with that and
888.84s: that that's very challenging and people
891.08s: don't get that and I remember going to
893.28s: my ninja training talking to my ninja
895.12s: teacher he would always say this thing
896.96s: everybody wants to be a ninja but nobody
898.56s: wants to do ninja [ __ ] or be a you know
900.84s: like he didn't say [ __ ] cuz he's a
902.64s: Buddhist monk but nobody wants to really
904.72s: put in that ninja effort and I like what
907.28s: well what do you mean he was like well
909.28s: if you're talking about being a ninja
911.52s: you're talking about a person who
913.44s: understands how people psychology work
915.76s: and how to work that psychology to your
918.76s: advantage and so how do you learn that
922.08s: you have to actually for most part most
924.36s: people have to go through it and that's
926.76s: tough and so that means that m teachers
930.00s: of this would do stuff like oh yeah
932.60s: Chris he sucks I don't want him around a
935.72s: matter of fact you guys should beat him
937.56s: up we don't want him here
939.16s: anymore then everybody's like the
941.68s: teacher told us to beat you up and do
943.40s: all this stuff and you're like but I
945.12s: trust my teacher why would he do that
947.00s: you know and then like you come back and
948.80s: you're like teacher they told me that
950.04s: you said to beat me up and he's like no
951.92s: I didn't tell him that you know like
953.80s: like you're my favorite like what are
955.00s: you talking about like I told everybody
956.64s: that you were my favorite and not to
958.00s: touch you and then you look at them and
959.36s: you're like well why did they beat me up
960.68s: and you know and then like later it
962.32s: comes out that that was all part it's
964.80s: all a part of you understanding how that
968.36s: feels and how to recreate that for other
971.68s: people and the only and the best way to
973.92s: do that is to have you go through it go
977.28s: through it so that you can know on some
979.16s: level what that feeling is and those
982.20s: that are the best in scop they hold on
985.40s: to that and they know how to recreate
987.12s: that really well so it's not not
989.16s: necessarily giving you an immunity to it
991.88s: no from what I understand there is no
993.76s: immunity unless you're in my opinion
995.72s: unless you're a psycho you know where
997.40s: you're just like completely disconnected
999.40s: from emotion and life and you you just
1002.20s: want to live alone as a Hermit those are
1004.20s: very and those are people out there
1005.64s: right but they're very Unique
1006.92s: Individuals like that's not everybody
1009.00s: you know uh the majority of us have want
1011.40s: to have connections and social
1013.56s: connections and be with people and we
1016.60s: have triggers and we have hooks right so
1020.00s: uh but there's so many people out there
1022.12s: that um who not so many but a small
1025.68s: majority out there are minority out
1027.56s: there that don't actually follow those
1029.40s: rules and and they're kind of
1031.20s: interesting individuals and normally you
1033.12s: can pick them out you know because they
1035.00s: just don't kind of fit in well and
1036.88s: there's some who pretend you know there
1038.60s: are psychopaths out there murderers out
1040.60s: there who pretend to be like what you
1043.24s: expect him to see like in the show
1045.00s: Dexter I'm not sure if you ever saw
1046.52s: right yeah of course but like he it his
1048.44s: whole life was about like trying to
1050.44s: pretend to be normal you know even
1052.48s: though he wasn't but when you are just a
1056.16s: real normal person and you go into one
1058.44s: of these things then you start realizing
1060.48s: that you're not immune neither we all
1062.76s: have a hook and if you use that and
1065.60s: understand that then that actually makes
1066.88s: you a little bit in my opinion A Little
1068.40s: Bit Stronger because it's the ones who
1071.44s: believe that they know and that they own
1074.60s: everything about themselves that are the
1077.16s: easiest to for SHO
1079.76s: that's a big blow to the ego for a lot
1081.24s: of people oh yeah because a lot of
1082.48s: people are like not
1083.88s: me you hear it all the time you see it
1086.28s: all the time they're like impossible
1087.96s: that I'm being scoped yeah you know cuz
1090.56s: I know and I have the information and I
1092.64s: studied the trusted sources and you know
1094.96s: I knows are the easiest people to fool
1097.48s: yeah that's why I even asked Lou like if
1099.68s: he Lou alzando I was like is there a
1102.32s: potential that you might be being used
1105.00s: by like government agencies for like
1106.60s: their own agenda and he goes it's
1108.84s: possible he's like I know a lot of the
1111.44s: tricks and there hasn't been one sign
1114.24s: like usually like there's like a
1115.40s: Telltale like something he's like I
1117.00s: haven't seen anything but again you know
1120.08s: even he admits possible right yeah um
1124.12s: they're that good huh yeah yeah and
1126.80s: there's this has been going on for a
1128.40s: long time so again tying back to my
1130.80s: ninja stuff um sometimes uh a group or a
1134.72s: clan because everybody signs on if
1136.76s: you're going to be a ninja going out
1138.24s: there you know that your life could be
1140.00s: on the line and that you may not make it
1141.84s: back right so with that understanding
1144.76s: and not being in these groups not being
1147.04s: tied to the way we normally see things
1149.48s: they're they kind of operate from the
1151.00s: scheme of totality so like things are
1153.64s: happening the way they should happen and
1155.44s: and that's that's kind of tough for
1156.88s: people to get they would send people off
1159.12s: on these missions with false information
1161.16s: and then feed the enemy information so
1163.32s: that they can get captured so now you
1165.28s: got this agent out there that gets
1166.76s: captured that has certain information
1168.96s: they will resist because they think
1170.68s: their information is true and real and
1173.72s: then when they finally crack and give
1175.44s: that information it was all false
1176.96s: information to begin with wow you get
1178.84s: what I'm saying and I read that in the
1180.72s: book um uh misinformation or yeah see
1184.00s: the disinformation of misinformation
1185.48s: it's a it's a book that came from a guy
1187.52s: who was KGB and like defected and he was
1190.40s: saying how they would often set up whole
1193.36s: companies like shell fake companies with
1196.56s: people real people in them who actually
1198.80s: had real jobs who thought they were
1200.52s: doing real things but all of that was
1202.80s: part of the scop it was all part of the
1204.60s: scam so if someone infiltrated that
1207.08s: place and got information from let's say
1209.20s: you you're telling a story that you
1211.52s: truly believe you're not lying but that
1215.08s: story and that job and everything about
1217.28s: it was all set up as a way as a
1219.32s: diversionary tactic for a really good
1221.88s: you know counter spy program or another
1224.28s: spy program from another country you
1226.04s: know wow yeah that's that's intense
1229.16s: and we can't do that on in average in
1232.16s: our average day everyday Society we
1234.68s: can't deal with that type of depth uh
1238.44s: and breadth of like manipulation and
1241.40s: illusion right you don't have time you
1243.24s: don't have time and you don't want to in
1244.96s: your brain's just like we need it easy
1246.80s: we need it packaged and as a magician
1248.80s: you know that very well it's like they
1251.80s: don't want to think how the depths of
1255.68s: how these organizations would go to
1259.24s: create the illusion you know and so just
1262.60s: like sometimes you look at a magician or
1265.16s: you find out about like how they do
1266.68s: certain tricks you're like nobody would
1268.04s: go that far and then and you're like but
1271.20s: all of The Magicians behind the scenes
1272.80s: are like yeah we do go that far we'll go
1275.04s: that far for the trick you know like
1277.00s: Houdini you know this guy's
1279.16s: like locking himself up and you know
1281.96s: upside down and water stuff and you know
1284.48s: and and people are like no way he it has
1287.08s: to be real it has to be magic nobody
1289.00s: would actually go through these depths
1290.84s: to make it so and you told me a story
1293.00s: about the Handcuff thing oh yeah yeah
1295.52s: Houdini is really interesting because
1297.36s: like his skill wasn't being a magician
1300.68s: uh according to other magicians he was
1302.64s: he was pretty much a [ __ ] magician he
1304.00s: wasn't a great magician he gets that rap
1306.60s: because he was the most famous magician
1308.64s: but he was actually a fantastic escape
1310.68s: artist and even better than being an
1313.16s: escape artist he was a good marketer and
1315.52s: he had a whole I went to copperfield's
1317.88s: Museum and he showed me um he has he has
1320.92s: basically his whole Library he also has
1322.40s: his filing cabinet Houdini's actual
1324.12s: filing cabinet there's a whole giant
1325.60s: section that's just marketing schemes
1327.56s: yeah and it's labeled as such and it's
1330.60s: filled with the different lengths that
1333.08s: Houdini would go through to draw a crowd
1337.08s: you know and he has some of these most
1338.40s: amazing escapes there's 100,000 people
1340.64s: watching him escape from a straight
1342.04s: jacket like suspended right and so like
1345.44s: he would for instance you know go to
1347.68s: like the best uh handcuff place and be
1349.96s: like you guys need to tweak this this
1352.16s: and this to make it you know even better
1354.24s: that would be and they're like all right
1355.64s: and they do that and then um he'd have
1359.48s: them bring it to like the police station
1361.68s: and be like these are the best handcuffs
1363.48s: in the world no one will get out of
1365.76s: these right and it just so happens
1367.36s: Houdini would come into town and be like
1369.24s: I will break out of any handcuffs here
1372.04s: uh if anyone has handcuffs I will break
1373.88s: out of them without issue yeah and the
1376.20s: cops were like huh yeah you think you
1378.60s: break out of these These are the best
1380.20s: and we have a certificate and he's like
1381.88s: all right and little did they know that
1384.64s: he had made those tweaks so that he can
1387.60s: pick the locks easier or find a way out
1390.00s: or finagle his way out of these cuffs
1392.64s: and you know so he would say fine you
1394.32s: choose the Cuffs you choose the place
1395.72s: and he would do that and so he's
1397.48s: magicians often do that too they go
1399.12s: through great Great Lengths and that's
1400.96s: why I find this common bond between what
1403.40s: you're saying and I find it so
1404.88s: fascinating cuz you uh are playing with
1408.20s: people
1409.12s: psychology a lot like that's the whole
1410.96s: thing psychological operations um so
1413.48s: you're you're a bit of a magician
1414.80s: yourself here yeah well thank you yeah
1419.72s: Abracadabra okay so um C can you give us
1423.16s: a practical example uh and this doesn't
1426.12s: have to be something you've done it can
1427.76s: be but let's just say for argument sake
1430.08s: just something uh that you would do
1432.64s: let's say to Red Team to make to make
1436.00s: something happen can you give us some
1437.28s: type of scenario where scops would be
1439.08s: very useful and how you would well I
1440.68s: think one Hot Topic today which I think
1443.12s: we could talk about is like um and I
1445.40s: always see things come out in the news
1447.36s: and I start brainstorming like if my
1449.68s: commander came in and said hey this is
1451.76s: what we need people to believe or think
1454.20s: how I would do that you know and one of
1457.36s: the topics is the uaps that the drones
1461.56s: UAP whatever you want to call it that
1463.40s: are flying all over the place there are
1465.28s: these uh
1466.68s: installations and you know one way I was
1470.76s: thinking about that is if I did not know
1473.36s: and did not have control over what was
1476.16s: actually
1477.56s: happening and but I didn't want mass
1480.08s: panic or I didn't want I want it to kind
1482.08s: of control the narrative then I would
1485.76s: have put I would put up as many flying
1489.20s: weird drones as possible so that the
1492.16s: average person who doesn't want to
1494.40s: believe will look at that and say oh
1496.20s: that's just a drone even though they
1497.48s: know it's like super weird and odd you
1500.04s: know they're just going to go with their
1501.76s: own bias and say no that can't be that
1504.04s: they they did say on the news that it
1505.32s: was all these things and that would be
1507.40s: like a good little scop which is like
1510.48s: okay there are things flying we don't
1512.76s: know what they are but we don't want the
1514.48s: average person to know that we don't
1516.20s: know so we're going to say that they're
1518.52s: just these things that we can all relate
1520.44s: to and then for those who might have a
1522.64s: different opinion we're going to toss
1524.68s: another thing out there and we're going
1526.00s: to say plasmoids
1529.40s: so it's either a drone or a plasmo but
1531.12s: the plasmo has a scientific Foundation
1533.32s: the Drone has a scientific Foundation it
1535.92s: all screams that we
1538.36s: understand you know what what's
1540.76s: happening or what it is maybe not where
1543.40s: it's coming from but we all understand
1545.44s: what's happening so it doesn't give
1546.84s: people this feeling of insecurity like
1549.48s: we literally can't control our skies and
1552.04s: we don't know how to deal with these
1554.32s: things that are up there and there's
1555.52s: still that debate there but if if you if
1557.80s: you really look at it
1560.24s: it's it's new information coming out all
1562.96s: the time and the information that's
1564.40s: coming out is changing some people are
1566.00s: saying Mothership some people are saying
1567.60s: this and it's keeping you from landing
1569.36s: on any one thing um because everybody's
1572.36s: kind of like this is what I think and I
1574.28s: have people who told me this is the
1576.08s: truth and this is what I think so it
1577.96s: leaves you kind of confused and as long
1580.68s: as you're confused you're not on any
1582.96s: anybody's side and you can't really take
1585.16s: a stand right interesting
1588.40s: stuck in the illusion long enough for us
1590.36s: to get through it yeah so that you can't
1593.12s: really land on anything cuz once you
1595.12s: land on something and you can then take
1597.00s: a stand and say hey I want to know more
1600.00s: about this because this is what I
1602.16s: understand this is a you
1604.32s: unidentified uh anomalous you know
1607.08s: object in the sky and I want to know
1610.08s: what it is you have said that it's
1613.56s: something that we can't discern that
1615.76s: it's doing things that we don't
1617.44s: understand and if you say say that then
1619.20s: now all of us are going to band together
1620.60s: and demand more answers but if you're
1623.28s: like it could be a drone and then some
1625.84s: of them are plasmoids and then some of
1627.52s: them this and makes it a lot harder
1629.16s: keeping them suspended in confusion is
1632.32s: is an actual tactic yeah that's really
1634.56s: interesting you can't unify if you're in
1636.44s: confusion yeah and you can also I mean I
1638.36s: suppose you can just disseminate false
1640.36s: info through the ranks as well in that
1642.56s: case and be like here we'll tell the
1644.04s: police we'll get we'll do this for the
1646.08s: police or we'll do this the CIA or we'll
1647.52s: do this the FBI
1648.72s: and now the answers are conflicting and
1651.92s: it's it's Up For Debate still meanwhile
1653.60s: they're fixing whatever is happening
1655.24s: yeah um what do you think is the move
1658.76s: because I've I've speculated that much
1660.32s: as well that that's what's going on
1661.68s: they're covering something with more
1663.00s: things right they're just uh in Magic we
1665.52s: have an expression the uh larger motion
1668.04s: hides the smaller motion so if I were to
1671.08s: do like some you know if I were to do
1673.96s: this and just vanish the pen that's a
1676.48s: small motion your eyes are kind of like
1678.28s: on my hands but if I
1680.20s: go now there's like more the bigger
1682.88s: motion hides the smaller motion yeah and
1685.64s: that happens too so if you got like
1687.08s: specific drones going around well let's
1688.80s: get more drones and now it's like now
1690.52s: the misdirect is happening where do we
1694.56s: land once the Drone situation is
1698.44s: resolved how do they uh the people who
1702.20s: who are you know doing all the activity
1705.68s: how do they break that to people so you
1709.28s: mean now that it's over and off the news
1713.92s: and yeah like what do they say like how
1715.60s: do they resolve it like obviously on the
1717.76s: news they said oh it's just FAA whatever
1719.52s: but it's still going on now yeah yeah so
1722.64s: once they really figure out what's been
1724.88s: going on how do they how do they tell us
1727.88s: everything's okay now do they go oh it
1730.84s: was just an exercise or they like
1733.44s: where's your head there what do you
1734.52s: think
1735.44s: they um I think that saying that it's an
1739.80s: exercise is one way which is kind of to
1742.88s: some degree that's coming out and it
1745.24s: really depends on what the what was the
1747.60s: purpose and what is the outcome um so
1751.12s: whatever they figure out is the truth
1754.52s: then you know where you're going to go
1757.36s: from there depends on what how you want
1759.44s: people to perceive that truth or an
1762.48s: untruth you get what I'm saying like if
1764.28s: it is an actual UAP right then it's like
1766.96s: we still don't want people to know that
1768.68s: so we have to say that it was a training
1771.40s: exercise maybe people will get with that
1773.52s: you know or um we have to say that it
1776.60s: was us running some special Mission
1779.28s: secret mission you know where where it
1781.88s: gives me an out because it's like oh
1784.76s: that's why we couldn't tell you because
1786.04s: it was a secret mission sorry about that
1788.20s: but this was for National Security you
1790.44s: know like um yeah so and then you know
1793.48s: most of us you know most of us Patriots
1795.40s: would be like oh okay yeah okay got it
1797.28s: you know uh they did what they had to do
1799.44s: yeah they did what they had to do and it
1801.00s: did make us uncomfortable but we
1802.96s: understand that you know for theer for
1804.72s: the greater good yeah so we'll explain
1806.48s: it away and then we'll also explain it
1808.44s: away to our friends you know because we
1810.16s: want to be right and we want to know
1812.28s: that our version of the way the story
1814.76s: turns out and what we agree with is
1816.48s: right so we'll pass that we'll
1817.96s: perpetuate that cycle yeah personal
1821.12s: that's like that's that hook again yeah
1823.56s: um and we're going to get to that in a
1824.92s: second because that's really interesting
1826.24s: and that's like I I feel like that's the
1827.72s: Bas line of scop is that hook yeah do
1831.60s: you when you see somebody like Jake
1833.88s: Barber or Lou Aliso or any of these guys
1838.16s: Muggles us here we're we're watching
1840.56s: this stuff and we're commenting scop or
1843.36s: like this is uh does that ever go
1846.04s: through your mind as well or is there
1847.68s: ever a point where you rule out the scop
1850.16s: completely I never rule it out
1852.56s: personally me personally because I've
1855.08s: seen people on mass scals and I've a
1858.20s: part of people on mass gal's
1860.72s: like perfect example there is nothing
1864.48s: more trippy then for you I was tactical
1868.16s: scop so we only worked in teams of three
1870.44s: with one uh local National or foreign
1873.32s: National that will work with us to kind
1874.96s: of help us understand culture and that
1877.76s: you know cuz sometimes we may think it's
1879.96s: okay to put this on a flyer but that
1881.56s: actually means like you know to hell
1883.40s: with your mom you know so so that person
1885.96s: will help us understand the culture and
1888.12s: and how that culture operates a little
1890.12s: bit deeper who lives there um so we
1893.96s: worked in these very small teams there's
1896.60s: nothing more trippy than to see
1898.84s: something that you and a team of well
1901.32s: you're a team of three so two other
1902.88s: people and this one person this one
1905.28s: other person dreamt
1908.12s: up as to how to manipulate and what you
1911.48s: want to people to say and what you want
1913.12s: the people to do and then start
1915.44s: communicating with people in that
1917.08s: environment and that group or that tribe
1919.68s: or in that culture and they start saying
1922.48s: back to you things that you
1924.32s: wrot that you wanted them to say on the
1926.92s: board but they are saying it like it's
1929.24s: their Discovery like it's their truth
1932.08s: now nothing will blow your mind more and
1935.36s: make you
1936.44s: feel like you are also programmed you're
1939.56s: like whoa what the hell am I saying then
1942.12s: what am I doing did somebody also write
1944.28s: that on the board somewhere and say this
1946.00s: is what we want hakee and people like
1948.08s: IIM to say and it's nothing more trippy
1951.88s: it's like it's again it's like you're in
1954.24s: a Dream It's a magic trick it's a magic
1956.12s: trick it's yes exactly you're like
1958.64s: looking at somebody and you want them to
1960.60s: believe that it's magic and that it was
1962.84s: like it came out of The Ether and you
1964.92s: got the these wizard abilities but
1967.56s: really you're like that's what I wanted
1969.84s: you to believe but I actually just did
1971.68s: this thing and that's that's
1974.68s: overwhelming and if if you know
1980.64s: not if let me own it so me coming back
1983.96s: and having aspects of PSD PTSD right um
1988.40s: one of the biggest was that I didn't
1990.12s: trust
1991.44s: anything you know every freaking thing
1994.72s: in my world was an
1996.48s: illusion I had been behind the curtain
1998.92s: brother I was like I was The Wizard of
2001.36s: Oz me and my crew you know so I'm I'm
2006.12s: pulling the strings and making people
2008.08s: think the wizard The Wizard oh they got
2010.44s: he's got these magic powers and stuff
2012.40s: like that and then and then you see
2014.40s: behind the curtain if you are awakened
2016.84s: in cerebral some people can disassociate
2018.88s: from that but I had once I once I
2020.64s: started having this deeper understanding
2022.48s: it started really getting to me I was
2024.28s: just like man um I'm in Oz you know I'm
2029.64s: in Oz I'm a part of Oz I'm helping
2031.80s: perpetuate eyes like it's like it's
2034.76s: crazy it's like that's it's Prof
2038.24s: you know there's a I expect there's like
2040.32s: a certain level of guilt there as well
2041.80s: that comes along with that and that's
2043.36s: it's a whole lot part of the
2044.20s: postraumatic stuff yeah and that's why I
2046.12s: started uh you know I went out and I
2048.12s: started doing talks and I've been
2050.16s: working on this book called Pinocchio's
2052.00s: Liberation you know um this idea of this
2055.76s: you know doll that's controlled being
2059.12s: liberated you know uh through
2062.12s: understanding and knowledge about what
2064.88s: what is happening in the world and how
2067.84s: you can those strings are all on all of
2070.92s: us you know but it's recognizing that
2073.84s: this string is pulling me this way and
2075.56s: saying oh nope I don't want to go that
2077.12s: way I don't want to go that way that's a
2079.16s: whole that's this attention this
2080.96s: attentiveness to my feelings and my
2083.76s: emotions stuff that you would get
2085.20s: through deep meditation and deep
2087.56s: self-reflection um to pull away from
2089.60s: that and say okay well maybe I'm being
2092.04s: led down this path and um and and and I
2095.24s: want to be an active participant in
2098.24s: understanding whether or not I want to
2100.36s: go down that way or I'm going to go
2103.12s: another way versus just going down that
2105.12s: way like a zombie and not realizing it
2107.36s: yeah so to a certain extent you are kind
2110.08s: of immune and not immune in the sense
2112.60s: like it'll never happen but being aware
2116.20s: of it yeah definitely helps if you are
2120.72s: also aware that you can be affected yes
2123.68s: because it doesn't help if you're if you
2125.16s: think you're immune yes right you can be
2126.92s: aware of it but if think you're immune
2128.32s: to it then being aware of it doesn't
2130.52s: help you yes but if you're aware of it
2132.60s: and know that you're susceptible to it
2135.00s: then you can put yourself into that mind
2136.72s: state of someone who would be
2138.04s: susceptible and kind of like help you
2140.08s: navigate out of it that's really
2142.12s: interesting and I think that I because
2143.80s: I'm hearing you talk man and I'm like
2145.08s: this is exactly like talking to a
2146.80s: magician like we're saying the same
2148.36s: things here and I am a magician yeah
2150.88s: we're saying the same things and and you
2152.92s: know the the difference is is that
2155.12s: magicians well for the most part I won't
2157.64s: won't say all of them but we do walk an
2159.96s: ethical line when it comes to that stuff
2162.44s: because I'm I know for a fact that I can
2166.60s: convince people that I have psychic
2168.40s: ability I can do that I've done it you
2171.24s: know in the past when learning magic and
2173.76s: you get this high off of like
2175.56s: controlling controlling situation
2177.48s: controlling people's perception about
2178.96s: you about life about their own reality
2181.28s: it becomes like you're like whoa and
2182.88s: that's a dangerous thing a lot of
2185.00s: responsibility there and you know it
2187.12s: took me a few years to really understand
2188.92s: that and that that is a very slippery
2192.80s: slope and in the wrong hands uh can be
2195.68s: weaponized yeah yeah yeah and and that
2199.04s: was one of the things when we went
2200.68s: through scop school that I took very
2203.20s: personal is it was like don't use this
2205.32s: on American civilians so actually the
2207.44s: way the the description upside up is to
2212.32s: um influence the hearts and minds of
2215.44s: foreign Target audiences so it's
2217.76s: something that you're supposed to use
2218.88s: domestically illegal to use yeah even
2221.44s: though we get around it you know um all
2224.28s: the time I think it was like Smith and
2226.48s: and berts or something like that there's
2228.28s: a actual um article that tells us that
2231.48s: we can't use it here in the states and
2234.32s: so we get around that by saying
2236.28s: information operations or marketing
2238.84s: military yeah that that's that'll blow
2241.12s: your mind too so we're you know I may
2243.68s: have told you this but you know people
2245.76s: were not supposed to use S on the
2248.04s: American public but then people get out
2250.28s: and then they go into marketing
2251.80s: organizations and what are they doing
2253.52s: they're not going to just say well I'm
2254.80s: just going to throw away all his
2255.92s: training they're going to use that
2257.20s: training to help them forward the agenda
2260.04s: of the marketing company um or they go
2262.44s: into Political strategy and then they
2264.40s: use that information to help you know
2266.56s: this politician or media and so um they
2270.72s: are using it y they're just renaming it
2273.36s: rebranding it yeah they're saying I'm
2275.08s: not using scop yeah yes you are you know
2278.04s: it's and it's all you know bernes and
2280.32s: all of these guys help develop and
2282.48s: bernes is directly related to Stan Freud
2285.36s: yes and what's funny is that uh the one
2288.72s: of the founders of Netflix is actually
2290.28s: related to bernes oh wow I did not know
2293.04s: that that's a bigs and that's true you
2295.08s: can you can look that up wow he's a
2297.00s: direct directly related wow um so you
2300.04s: know you go from the father of modern
2302.60s: psychology to the father of propaganda
2305.56s: propanda to the CEO of Netflix
2308.08s: wow that's pretty impactful yeah yeah
2312.40s: and that's that's it right so these guys
2315.72s: help develop and create how we think and
2320.16s: and and then they created these programs
2322.92s: to help us manipulate and influence
2325.00s: people and how they think and
2327.72s: so you know that's that's the foundation
2331.64s: of a lot of this so let's talk about
2333.96s: this hook this is something that I find
2336.96s: so so interesting because this is this
2340.48s: is the this is the most important part
2341.88s: for me because if you can find someone's
2344.12s: hook that's their kill's heel and online
2347.64s: it's pretty easy to find someone's hook
2349.40s: because you can just like trigger them
2350.84s: with different comments yeah and as soon
2352.48s: as they start responding you're like oh
2354.76s: little sensitive area here it seems like
2356.40s: right yeah and that's where you attack
2358.04s: that sensitive area until they break
2360.32s: that's kind of like what we've been
2361.24s: seeing online with Bots and stuff and
2362.88s: that's how that works yeah can you
2364.28s: explain what exactly a hook is and what
2367.48s: you do to use that hook yeah so one of
2371.20s: the ways that we look at scop is we're
2373.40s: always looking at how do we influence a
2376.12s: person based on their values or belief
2379.28s: system or you know their emotions things
2382.08s: of that nature and those things are can
2384.56s: can be considered hooks they are things
2387.12s: that a person um is doing subconsciously
2391.28s: and reacting to in their life based on
2393.76s: their belief system and and the
2395.44s: structure of how they walk in the world
2398.16s: that it's very difficult for them to
2400.20s: break free so for instance we'd say like
2402.48s: you know food could be a hook right and
2404.60s: we see people addicted to different
2406.32s: types of food and they're like man I
2408.00s: know I need to stop this but I can't
2409.88s: right and then you know you will see
2412.76s: like this uh commercial for these golden
2415.24s: McDonald fries and the salt and stuff
2417.76s: and it makes people salivate and then
2419.32s: they're like oh I need those fries you
2421.00s: know even though they know they
2422.32s: shouldn't be doing that so I like to
2425.36s: explain it like well what is what do we
2428.84s: know of a hook normally we think of
2431.40s: hooks as things that go on end fishing
2433.44s: lines and go in the water and fish bite
2436.36s: them shits all the time yeah right and
2439.44s: you think the fish the you know the the
2441.80s: Council of fish don't get together and
2443.68s: say we shouldn't do that but they're
2445.08s: still doing it you know like and that's
2448.00s: because um you know we and then you go
2450.92s: to fishing shops and they have different
2452.60s: LS and the ls look different ways and
2454.88s: they say oh this one gets a lot of bites
2456.64s: with the best and this one gets a lot of
2458.32s: bites with these type and so they're
2460.20s: we're on on that scale we're doing the
2462.60s: same they're doing the same thing as
2463.96s: what you know governments are doing to
2465.60s: the people or other organizations are
2468.32s: doing to the people where that hook and
2471.28s: what's on it it's something that it's
2473.40s: really tough for you to resist you know
2476.16s: and I tell people if you you know some
2477.92s: of us have bad habits like picking our
2479.64s: fingers like for me it's picking my
2480.96s: fingers sometimes and I know I don't
2484.08s: I've I've said plenty of times I want to
2486.12s: stop doing that right
2488.00s: and then I'll see I'll get really in
2490.08s: especially when I'm deep in thought I'll
2491.44s: start picking at my fingers yeah yeah
2493.60s: and then I'm like ah don't do that don't
2495.84s: do that because that's bad for your
2496.92s: fingers and then I'll be like okay so
2498.92s: what was I thinking about yeah okay
2501.72s: right back right back to it and so the
2503.88s: hook would be that thing so for me if I
2506.96s: was doing a talk on stage and I wanted
2509.04s: to Target you directly to single you out
2512.20s: I might use an arbitrary example and be
2514.48s: like you know there's a lot of people
2515.92s: low on the IQ uh level that like pick
2518.44s: their pick their fingers you know these
2519.60s: type of people and and I would just go
2521.72s: on and you'd be like oh that's me all of
2523.96s: a sudden yeah you'd feel targeted
2525.84s: insecure you know and that look for that
2528.64s: reaction that's right and you you would
2530.64s: start questioning yourself yeah am I low
2533.20s: IQ how is that correlated yeah uh how do
2536.24s: I and it would it would bother you right
2538.24s: so like that's that's the idea of like
2541.36s: you can find really specific hooks for
2544.20s: specific people yeah and that's what's
2546.12s: so like
2548.24s: so um Insidious or you know very hid
2552.96s: very powerful about scop because what
2555.88s: happens is once you find that hook it
2560.44s: makes things so much easier because all
2563.40s: you do is package everything every
2566.20s: message you want to get within the
2569.00s: confines of that hook and and then
2572.16s: people just eat it up because they can't
2574.44s: a lot of us don't aren't consciously
2576.56s: aware enough to know like hey I did we
2580.60s: just accept it and so um I used to hear
2584.16s: debates all the time um now a lot of
2587.00s: people don't trust the media uh but I
2589.28s: used to hear debates all the time well I
2591.72s: listen to Fox and you listen to CNN and
2594.80s: I do this and I do that and CNN always
2597.20s: lies to you guys and fox is always lying
2599.24s: to you guys and they're telling us to
2601.44s: you know this news station is telling us
2603.20s: the truth and then you had that like
2604.40s: Sinclair video come out and then then
2607.52s: you see like it's all like scripted and
2610.44s: it's all side by side and it didn't
2612.08s: matter if it was fox or CNN they're
2614.00s: saying the same thing cuz these guys are
2615.68s: owned by the same and people sorry whoa
2617.68s: wait a minute what what's going on there
2619.24s: we're extremely proud of the quality
2621.28s: balanced journalism that cbs4 news
2623.68s: produces but we are concerned
2628.84s: trons our country pling our country more
2632.16s: alarming some media Outlets publish
2634.24s: these same fake stories without checking
2636.56s: facts first the sharing of biased and
2638.88s: FAL false news has become all too common
2641.36s: on social
2648.92s: media
2657.52s: unfortunately and this is extrem
2659.76s: dangerous to our democracy and I still
2661.92s: think people didn't really get but
2663.40s: that's it most people were like that's
2665.48s: probably AI yeah that can't be real yeah
2668.44s: and they're just they're completely
2669.60s: fooled yeah because they gota be they
2671.76s: gotta be or else it it calls in the
2674.08s: question so many Choice it's almost like
2675.92s: when you go to a court and if um they
2679.36s: found out like um a judge or a lawyer
2683.16s: some firm or whatever was you know a
2685.36s: bunch of crackheads or drug addicts
2687.28s: right then it calls into question or
2689.44s: they were dirty dirty cops it calls into
2691.72s: question everything that they've done
2693.48s: before that and now we got to go back
2695.00s: and review all of that and that's
2697.48s: devastating so companies don't want to
2699.60s: look at it you know they they're like
2701.60s: they're like oh you know let's say just
2704.08s: say Chris had a problem and and kick him
2706.28s: out of there well if we admit that Chris
2707.88s: had a problem with drugs or alcohol and
2710.36s: while he was doing these cases then we
2712.08s: have to open up all those cases again
2714.32s: and that's going to hurt our St our
2716.36s: stats and then we're going to have to
2718.08s: you know and that's going to be too
2719.28s: costly so let's not say he had a drug
2721.52s: problem let's say he had like a you know
2723.92s: an affair with somebody you know like
2726.04s: cuz then that doesn't C in the question
2727.60s: these things and so um there's all this
2729.96s: manipulation happening but going back to
2731.96s: the point which is that when people
2734.08s: recognize that like you said they would
2735.92s: then have to call in question the
2738.04s: choices that they made and the things
2739.68s: that they've done based on the
2741.56s: information that they got from that news
2743.24s: source and so it's much easier to just
2745.56s: say it's AI yeah you know and it's much
2748.76s: easier for those news sources to say we
2750.96s: didn't say that that was AI yeah and
2753.84s: exactly and now because we're now you
2755.56s: got all these brains out there
2757.44s: for a way to make this right you know
2759.88s: reconcile it in their brain that they're
2762.08s: like okay yeah we knew that we're on
2763.84s: your side you know like we you know and
2766.80s: and then they can use that in their
2768.36s: arguments to when somebody says oh you
2771.40s: still listen to them remember that story
2773.44s: that came out where it showed all these
2775.24s: things oh no that was AI that was AI my
2778.36s: my they were trying to disprove my
2780.36s: trusted Source you know and they'll
2782.32s: defend it that is the best way to really
2786.44s: have be effective or do a quick Google
2788.76s: search yes and the and the number one
2790.72s: search result is it was AI true or not
2793.64s: true or not right and you're going to be
2795.24s: like I did my search exactly that's my
2796.96s: search exactly yeah I think we talked
2799.08s: about this before where one of the main
2802.40s: main persuasive tactics is not to force
2806.56s: something on somebody for them to
2808.36s: believe it right if you're a tyrant
2810.60s: eventually people are going to re Rebel
2812.52s: and overcome the way you do this best
2815.52s: the way you do SC best you set the
2817.72s: conditions for people to make the
2818.92s: choices and what you want them to make
2820.84s: but make but those conditions make them
2824.04s: make that choice so that they feel like
2827.12s: they made the choice based on their own
2829.28s: free will not because they was forced
2831.60s: into that choice does that make sense
2834.00s: and we saw that we and we saw that with
2836.72s: some things that happened over the last
2838.76s: few years where people went from I'm
2841.44s: totally against that to like making the
2843.28s: choice and then people fighting with
2844.76s: each other because they made the choice
2846.44s: and you make the choice and so on and so
2848.24s: forth and then you have all this
2850.72s: information going out there that
2852.28s: supports one side or the other and then
2855.64s: people are supporting using that as a
2858.12s: means to firm up and sure up their
2860.52s: stance right so you set the conditions
2863.32s: for people to make the choices that you
2865.16s: want them to make but feel like they
2867.92s: made them based on their own research
2870.36s: and knowledge they will then defend that
2873.48s: choice because it's it's their choice
2877.12s: yeah but if you force it on them then
2878.96s: they'll always you know push that choice
2881.44s: at some point that choice can come in
2883.48s: question and they could push it off and
2885.12s: say well Chris did tell me that and I
2887.00s: don't know if I trust him anymore but if
2890.12s: I'm like no I went out there I did the
2892.00s: homework I found it on this site I found
2894.20s: it on this site I did this that and the
2895.84s: other then it's a lot harder to convince
2898.00s: you otherwise because you feel like you
2900.12s: found it based on your own personal
2902.00s: research so this uh is a lot like in
2905.56s: Magic we talk about
2907.64s: contrast so the greater the contrast
2911.20s: without breaking your objective view of
2913.48s: reality the greater the reaction so the
2916.04s: greater the contrast between your view
2918.40s: of reality and this impossible event
2921.52s: yeah so the greater that is without
2923.64s: breaking it without becoming fantasy so
2926.12s: staying within your confines of your
2928.04s: objective view of reality and how
2929.32s: reality works if I can bend that and
2931.68s: create a big enough contrast without
2933.56s: breaking it bigger reaction yeah right
2936.44s: so
2937.48s: it helps to create a big contrast when
2941.12s: they are determining what is real they
2943.76s: are determining the uh the the extremes
2947.36s: of their own reality yeah right so
2949.40s: they're the ones making the framework
2951.44s: for the trick yeah they're the ones
2953.44s: determining no that's impossible or only
2955.88s: this is possible but you led them to
2958.36s: those points because you want them to be
2960.40s: at those extreme so that this trick
2961.80s: plays a lot bigger because if that
2963.76s: contrast is smaller and they don't do
2966.72s: their own research it's hear say from
2968.16s: someone else or you know then the effect
2970.40s: isn't as great yeah so the bigger the
2972.52s: contrast and the more free will that is
2975.24s: involved well then the greater the
2977.04s: contrast the greater the effect right
2978.88s: yeah so the more that they can be
2981.60s: involved in the process of creating the
2983.72s: framework yeah for how they think the
2986.44s: greater the effect of the scup is going
2988.60s: to be exactly and the and the length the
2992.16s: greater the length at which it will
2993.96s: continue to persist in our lives right
2996.76s: right in their memory yeah and and
2998.84s: they'll they'll it'll go longer and
3000.72s: longer and longer but like you said to
3002.56s: Shorter that effect to smaller that
3005.12s: effect the it'll it'll feel like really
3008.72s: intense for a little while but it'll
3010.28s: start to die down it'll fade down but
3012.36s: the greater that contrast it'll stick
3014.40s: around for a long time and they'll start
3016.20s: they'll keep telling the stories we
3017.44s: talked about a person who's telling
3019.52s: stories over and over and over again you
3021.52s: know every time they see you they keep
3022.96s: telling the same story and it's like
3024.52s: months that's gone by and they're still
3026.72s: telling that story it's getting crazier
3028.68s: yeah and it's getting more you know
3030.20s: Grand and you know and it's like yeah
3033.56s: you know that that effect will continue
3035.56s: to persist in their mind and they're
3037.56s: doing the work for you now a matter of
3040.24s: fact they they're not only doing the
3041.92s: work for you they're making the work
3044.08s: more substantial because they keep
3046.44s: adding stuff onto it you know putting
3048.52s: stuff in there and that that would be
3049.88s: the greatest s up then there's groups
3052.04s: that reinforce that idea because they
3053.68s: also feel that way so they will then
3056.04s: support you you and encourage you to
3057.84s: keep believing that which you know y
3060.16s: those Echo Chambers or the bandwagon
3062.68s: effect you know where people want to
3064.32s: jump on the bandwagon and then we're all
3066.76s: on this bandwagon together you know
3068.92s: don't jump off questioning the bandwagon
3071.16s: gets you gets you get kicked off yeah or
3073.36s: Worse yeah and so that's that's it you
3077.12s: know um I was always amazed and scop to
3080.04s: realize that it is the foundation of
3082.56s: everything it's probably one of the most
3084.80s: powerful tools we have we think guns and
3087.12s: bombs and and all this crap is like
3089.52s: super powerful no the the those things
3092.20s: have no power without the until we get
3094.20s: more robots and AI but anyway those
3096.48s: things have no power without the people
3098.44s: behind them and so um we are physical
3102.64s: representations of how we how we feel
3105.32s: and what we are on the inside right and
3107.68s: that's one of the things that I learned
3109.04s: from Ninjutsu is our physical reality
3111.32s: tends to be a manifestation of who and
3114.80s: what we're feeling on the inside so you
3116.88s: want to know how a person thinks and you
3119.80s: want to know how a person operates just
3121.64s: look at how they're operating in the
3123.12s: world and then track that backwards and
3125.28s: you'll start to see who they are deep
3127.16s: inside As Above So Below yes exactly
3130.52s: exactly and that's really what we have
3132.68s: to recognize so then that if we know
3135.16s: that then we know bullets don't fly and
3137.20s: bombs don't go off unless the people
3139.96s: behind them are actually giving those
3142.52s: orders and then there are reasons why
3144.32s: they might give those orders and those
3146.12s: reasons are based on how they perceive
3148.60s: the world and so if you're manipulating
3151.08s: and influencing how people perceive the
3153.00s: world you have the ability to start
3155.32s: conflict or end conflict or get conflict
3158.28s: to be um you know like a like balance
3161.52s: and neutralize you know so this is
3163.72s: really the overall idea when you're
3166.40s: looking at desability and so we realized
3171.84s: uh when we were fighting in you know
3173.56s: Germany at that time yeah Hitler say um
3177.52s: when we were going against him like the
3179.64s: power of true propaganda like like that
3182.08s: dude was like amazing you know and his
3184.08s: General and the people that he had
3185.68s: around him that were working for him he
3187.52s: had one specific guy I can't remember
3189.12s: his name but this guy was the the head
3191.84s: of his prop G or say it one more time
3195.04s: Gobles that sounds like it is yeah and
3197.52s: this dude was in charge of all of his
3199.88s: propaganda and stuff like that and he
3201.36s: was a genius it was before the internet
3203.60s: right so you were in this incredible
3206.08s: Echo chamber but yeah they they were
3208.36s: they were really the first ones to
3209.84s: capitalize on that type of propaganda
3212.08s: and create that this patriotic yeah you
3215.36s: know because and that's often what
3216.56s: people think of like how evil are these
3219.48s: are these Nazis it's like the
3221.24s: individuals who were Nazis like most of
3224.16s: them were just like everyone else yeah
3226.64s: they over time really you know a lot of
3229.84s: them were were forced to it there a
3231.44s: there's a whole you know gamut of
3233.32s: reasons you know why that that happened
3235.20s: but one of the major reasons was the
3236.84s: psychological warfare against their own
3238.32s: people yes and it got it convinced them
3241.52s: that they were the good guys yes you
3243.44s: know and that everybody else was bad and
3246.24s: so they attacked it from a very
3249.08s: justifiable position they're like no I'm
3251.12s: doing the right thing which was indeed
3254.16s: the very the worst thing yeah uh but the
3256.88s: the SC up was so great that it convinced
3258.88s: them that they were doing the right
3260.00s: thing yeah and that is I mean that's
3262.24s: that's scary it's very scary and so
3264.60s: there are two things that I want to say
3265.92s: on that topic one was one of is this
3268.08s: really cool video game that I ended up
3269.76s: finding a long time ago uh was
3271.76s: introduced to me by a friend of mine who
3273.60s: was also a training in Ninjutsu and he
3275.72s: was like he was like oh let me tell you
3277.52s: the backstory of this game and so it was
3279.32s: like a ninja game right and there was
3282.44s: this clan and it had the eldest brother
3285.32s: middle brother and a sister and they
3287.12s: were like these really badass ninja
3289.72s: right and um the eldest brother was the
3291.96s: best and he went out on this Mission he
3294.16s: end up falling off this roof he hit his
3296.08s: head and and this other ninja Clan rival
3298.48s: ninja Clan found him and instead of
3300.64s: killing him once they realized they they
3303.20s: they were going to interrogate him but
3304.88s: they realized he lost his memory so they
3307.28s: were like oh we didn't know who you were
3309.44s: you're actually one of us and they re
3312.04s: they indoctrinated him in their Clan
3314.64s: right reprogrammed him right and so then
3318.08s: he so then he started fighting for them
3320.48s: and eventually he comes across his
3322.04s: brother and sister and they're like we
3323.36s: thought you were dead and he was like
3324.52s: you're the enemy what are you talking
3325.76s: about' and so his whole scope of reality
3328.76s: shifted and so what who was or
3332.12s: originally bad and his enemy became his
3334.44s: friend or his the his family and then
3337.48s: his family actually became his enemy and
3339.68s: so it's like it was this big twist and I
3342.48s: was like that's really interesting like
3344.88s: depending on what perspective we're
3346.36s: looking at and what information we're
3348.44s: fed um we can be really easily
3351.20s: manipulated into thinking that people
3353.08s: are subhuman or not human or so on and I
3355.72s: mean we see that in our country if we
3357.68s: look at our timeline whoever we were at
3359.68s: war with at whatever time that that
3362.44s: group gets a hard rap you know all
3365.84s: across the board you know it doesn't
3367.40s: matter if there's if we know some good
3369.72s: folks oh and you know well they're
3371.68s: different from that you know to
3373.00s: everybody else you know and and we start
3375.56s: do we start bringing up these really
3377.16s: questionable things the other thing is
3379.32s: that in our ninja training we actually
3381.12s: have an eight-step accomplishment plan
3383.24s: we call it and and the first one is
3387.00s: truth is relative try to see things from
3389.92s: others perspective without losing your
3391.72s: own try to see things as they really are
3394.40s: but stay tuned in right and so what it
3397.24s: says it what it gets us as ninja to
3400.48s: recognize is that yeah we might have our
3403.64s: version of what we deem the truth but
3406.92s: it's relative to my scope and what I do
3410.20s: the problem comes when I'm trying to
3412.04s: force my truth on you and that's what
3414.80s: creates conflict right and so it so it's
3417.64s: saying be very mindful of that be
3420.20s: mindful of this idea that truth is
3422.68s: relative based on my perception and the
3425.64s: people I'm around this is the truth um I
3429.12s: but it doesn't keep me from trying to
3430.84s: see things from your perspective right
3433.96s: without losing my own great advice does
3436.64s: that make sense so it doesn't it doesn't
3438.40s: mean I have to give up my truth to
3440.76s: understand your truth it just means that
3442.88s: I can hold on to mine and I'm still open
3445.48s: to sharing seeing things from your
3447.24s: perspective without losing my own and
3449.84s: then I'm also going to try to stay tuned
3452.16s: in because our truths are not the only
3454.84s: truth or maybe there's a part of what
3457.12s: you know that changes what I understand
3460.08s: about the world you wouldn't know
3461.48s: otherwise and I wouldn't know otherwise
3463.44s: and that's what I tell people today they
3464.88s: say well how do we beat sah because we
3466.76s: got to I say dude go out and find
3469.40s: somebody who you believe has a different
3471.72s: opinion than you and have that
3474.08s: conversation and see what they think
3476.44s: because now scop is works well because
3479.24s: we are third party we're using media and
3483.16s: radio and television and this and that
3485.84s: and if you're looking at that you don't
3488.12s: know if it's true or not we're we're
3490.04s: watching this person on the news and
3491.76s: they're telling us this thing and we're
3493.44s: thinking we connect with that person so
3495.60s: we think he's telling us the truth or
3497.12s: she's telling us the truth and instead
3499.68s: really what I need to be doing is having
3501.28s: a conversation with you directly yeah
3504.48s: and instead of relying on this person to
3506.92s: tell me how to think you know and we
3509.52s: have a hard time doing that so cut out
3511.84s: the middleman and go and have a
3513.88s: conversation now that's still a
3515.24s: different battle because then your
3517.52s: belief system based off your news or
3519.56s: whatever you're wherever you're getting
3520.92s: your information is influencing you and
3522.92s: wherever I'm getting my information
3524.36s: still influencing it but we have a
3526.92s: greater chance of overcoming that when
3529.68s: we can debate in person than if we're
3532.12s: debating through a television screen
3534.72s: yeah you know seems like removing the
3536.60s: ego is key to all of this because I
3538.96s: think that's the one thing that prevents
3540.12s: us from doing that because on paper
3541.64s: everything you're saying makes complete
3543.40s: sense yes in the real world uh ego gets
3545.96s: in the way yeah and we'd rather stick to
3548.48s: our guns than to you know drop our hands
3551.72s: down for two seconds and just listen and
3553.76s: and try to really picture a different
3556.00s: scenario because by doing that you play
3558.60s: a passive action uh um you take a
3561.92s: passive position yeah and most people
3564.40s: aren't comfortable taking a passive
3565.80s: position especially when it comes to
3567.16s: things that they really care about yeah
3569.20s: and so that's you know a lot of that is
3570.48s: just removing the ego and like what do
3572.68s: you have to say and really you know it's
3575.12s: you be like you said You' probably be
3576.72s: surprised how much the other person's
3579.76s: perspective can actually strengthen your
3582.12s: own if you listen right or help you with
3584.72s: your own you know
3586.92s: definitely yeah I I totally agree with
3589.56s: that and I think that's really important
3592.04s: I had this conversation with somebody
3594.04s: before and you know I I'm I'm just being
3596.92s: bare and raw but I had a friend and um
3599.64s: or I have a friend and I remember I
3602.32s: never been to his house and I go over
3604.96s: his house and you know I'm a kid from
3607.16s: New Jersey and so on and so forth don't
3609.24s: know much about the didn't know much
3611.84s: about the south until I moved to the
3613.68s: South and still I was still sheltered
3615.52s: because was I was in the military and
3617.04s: that's a different environment different
3619.24s: culture and I end up going to his
3621.44s: friend's house and he had a Confederate
3623.80s: flag hanging on his wall right and I was
3626.68s: like whoa you know I I thought I thought
3630.44s: this guy like I didn't know he was like
3632.88s: that and then I was like wait a minute
3634.52s: like what like everything I've known
3637.20s: this guy for years and everything he's
3639.60s: ever done in my life has been super
3641.40s: positive and we've been able to connect
3644.08s: and so on and so forth so I I went into
3646.16s: his we were in his garage I went into
3648.64s: his little room and he was there and I
3650.92s: was like Hey like I saw the Confederate
3653.44s: flag out there is that what do you what
3655.64s: do you doing with that you know the way
3657.60s: I from what I know it's it's it says hey
3660.72s: that you are you you believe in the
3663.52s: support of a group that says that you
3665.96s: know my culture or at least the Black
3668.00s: Culture could be you know suppressed and
3671.48s: like held down and all this other stuff
3673.80s: and and he was like oh oh no no that's
3676.76s: not that's that's not it where I when I
3679.52s: came up this was like a symbol of Pride
3681.32s: for the South and this that other I
3683.52s: that's not what was taught to me and and
3686.08s: we had this long
3688.20s: debate right and at the end there was
3691.48s: some things that we agreed on and there
3693.96s: were some things we didn't agree on but
3696.04s: the one the one thing we could agree on
3698.68s: was that we loved and supported each
3700.44s: other yeah and that that was not and he
3703.92s: even was like do you want me to take
3705.16s: that down if it makes you feel bad and I
3706.72s: was like after this conversation
3708.64s: actually no man this is your house and
3710.32s: so on and so forth but I feel much
3711.84s: better knowing that that wasn't the
3714.96s: perspective you were coming com from but
3717.12s: if I had just said oh no you know F that
3719.84s: guy you know he's this that other he's
3721.92s: racist blah blah blah then we would not
3723.48s: have been able to get through and we're
3725.04s: still friends to this day and um again
3728.96s: when I say support I mean this dude has
3731.44s: supported me on so many different things
3734.04s: in so many different ways so his actual
3736.76s: actions and the way he really operates
3738.68s: in life is not like that at all right
3741.60s: but he came from a different perspective
3743.56s: and a different background and so all
3746.28s: have our [ __ ] and we have to recognize
3748.92s: that we all have our [ __ ] we're all
3751.24s: dealing with stuff we all have these
3752.76s: beliefs that we haven't really deeply
3754.60s: examined that comes from where we come
3756.92s: from or what we and and sometimes those
3759.64s: things we just do things and don't
3761.24s: really deeply examine them and then
3763.28s: somebody calls us out and that's where
3765.08s: the real work begins we have these
3766.72s: conversations and we say okay well let
3769.04s: me um let me have this deep conversation
3771.16s: with you about this thing and then we
3773.12s: can get through it again if I let the
3775.08s: flag dictate who my friend is because
3779.04s: this guy I've known for years who
3780.76s: supported me in all these different ways
3783.16s: then and now I'm using that as a means
3785.12s: to say all that doesn't exist anymore
3787.12s: and that all this [ __ ] the only
3788.84s: thing that matters is this and now I
3790.64s: have a conversation then I thwart any
3793.40s: growth that could ever happen versus us
3796.36s: having a growing moment together he and
3798.72s: I and and and him recognizing that that
3801.84s: made me feel a certain way and
3803.56s: apologizing and me recognizing that that
3806.12s: wasn't where he was coming from and
3807.76s: apologizing and us still not agreeing
3810.20s: 100% I'm not saying that but agreeing
3813.16s: enough to where we were able to stay
3815.28s: friends yeah it isn't binary these
3817.28s: things the you know the the the human
3819.28s: spectrum of all the stuff that we're
3821.12s: talking about yeah there are an infinite
3824.44s: number of variables that impose
3826.52s: themselves and I guess being somebody
3828.48s: whether you're a magician whether you're
3829.76s: a scop expert you're looking to figure
3832.60s: out as many of those variables variables
3834.60s: as you can yeah but there's still
3836.08s: variables you didn't plan for yeah
3837.64s: there's still things that will take you
3838.80s: off guard and be like well I didn't plan
3840.40s: for this I didn't prepare for this and
3841.96s: understanding those yes will actually
3843.64s: help you on you know the future uh with
3846.72s: the future things okay dude this thank
3849.44s: you so much for sharing all this about
3850.88s: about the scop stuff and I'm I'm I mean
3853.52s: endlessly fascinated I could I want to I
3856.00s: could talk about scop for the rest of
3858.64s: this podcast because it relates so
3860.72s: closely to what uh we'll have to do a
3862.40s: part two to what I do we definitely have
3864.04s: to do a part two and but I do also want
3867.32s: to get on to you know some other
3869.00s: interesting things because you lead such
3871.16s: an interesting
3872.44s: life um the next thing I want to talk
3874.88s: about is your relationship to remote
3879.60s: viewing now as some of you know if you
3882.60s: guys aren't aware I I spent a year
3884.92s: researching remote viewing practicing it
3887.72s: meeting you know some of the people who
3890.28s: are the figureheads of remote viewing uh
3894.40s: you know Ed Ed May and mcmonagle and Ed
3897.52s: Dames and uh even Yuri Geller and you
3899.88s: know I spoke to all these people who
3901.08s: really taught me quite a bit and Brett
3902.48s: Stewart and and it was just so
3905.92s: fascinating and I went into it a skeptic
3908.92s: knowing magic knowing techniques and
3911.80s: confirmation bias and cold reading and
3913.80s: this stuff but after seeing the results
3917.04s: myself I came to the conclusion after
3918.80s: looking at the data because there's a
3919.88s: lot of data uh that there was something
3922.08s: there there's definitely something there
3924.76s: how did you you knowing what you know
3929.32s: because almost having a magician like
3931.28s: mine uh how how how did you get into
3934.44s: remote viewing and what happened to make
3936.28s: made you believe in this so I was
3940.20s: already kind of down the remote viewing
3942.52s: Rabbit Hole to a degree with my Ninjutsu
3945.68s: so the ninja had these nine abilities
3947.96s: this Coogi um you know these syllables
3951.44s: these nine syllables or nine powers that
3953.88s: they they they worked in and they you
3957.08s: and this came from um originally it was
3961.56s: tradition that came out of India and
3963.44s: then into China and Tibet and then to
3965.84s: Japan and then they kind of wo their
3968.00s: views and different things and had these
3970.40s: different practices and then ninja were
3972.96s: these villagers that used that as a
3975.40s: means to help them uh survive and thrive
3979.16s: in this society that really wanted to
3981.36s: destroy them and so one of the abilities
3985.16s: is remote viewing so I remember having
3988.24s: conversations with my teacher this guy
3990.28s: Stephen K Hayes and he was saying um hey
3993.84s: there was this time when the Army and
3996.08s: the military got really into like REM
3998.24s: this thing called remote viewing we know
3999.92s: it as something different if this like
4001.92s: cooi six or seven you know and um we're
4005.52s: we we worked it from a different angle
4007.28s: and they wanted to kind of see what I
4009.20s: knew about it and they had me fill out
4011.12s: all his paperwork and it was actually
4012.84s: through the air force uh um with Dell
4015.12s: graph
4016.16s: and when D graph was working his his
4018.36s: kind of he was interested in it before
4020.16s: he actually took over the unit for the
4022.40s: Army and so he did some stuff and he was
4025.64s: talking about that so I was still very
4027.84s: physical at the time and so the
4030.20s: spiritual stuff was exciting but not as
4032.96s: exciting as the physical stuff you know
4035.36s: and so we he talked about it we did some
4037.88s: meditations and stuff but then that was
4039.72s: it well later on in my life I came to
4043.52s: this point where I'm teaching at my my
4045.72s: different martial arts schools that I
4047.04s: own and I would see children now are all
4050.24s: into these animation characters and they
4052.08s: would run around and they would do these
4053.48s: mudras and they would act like they were
4055.64s: like summoning dragons and stuff and I'd
4057.68s: be like man this is cool this is like
4059.76s: they it was these ninja cartoons and
4061.72s: other cartoons like it that was using
4063.72s: this lore Nar ball yeah that come that
4066.84s: comes from this actual stuff you know
4069.20s: and I would try to have these
4070.12s: conversations like hey kids you know you
4072.08s: could really we got things like that in
4074.00s: our art you know and they'd be like
4075.60s: really yeah show me you know and and I
4078.80s: was like huh hm well if I wanted to show
4082.96s: them you know how did I learn and I was
4085.72s: like well I spent 25 years with my
4087.68s: teacher and doing stuff and diving into
4089.68s: this on my own and leaving New Jersey to
4091.56s: move to Ohio to train my teacher in the
4093.20s: woods and everything else and I'm like
4096.16s: uh okay kid train for 25 years with me
4099.04s: and I'll get you there you know and
4100.52s: they're like ah you know like I'm gonna
4103.04s: go back to you know doing my pretending
4106.00s: and I was like well if I the the the
4108.76s: youth are the Next Generation if I
4110.68s: really want to get them to understand
4112.88s: and not lose this knowledge um that I've
4115.72s: worked so hard to gain and others have
4118.08s: too we need to make it fun and exciting
4120.84s: and something easy where they can have
4122.36s: an experience right now with that truth
4124.56s: and then be able to thrive and grow in
4126.84s: that grow and thrive in that
4128.88s: experience and so I said well who's out
4131.16s: there doing stuff like that and then the
4132.60s: remote viewing came back and I was like
4135.04s: oh okay okay well maybe I should get
4136.92s: involved in that and really see what
4138.88s: protocols are out there and um started
4141.16s: looking into that and found my first
4143.20s: teacher Paul Smith who is an amazing
4145.96s: gentleman and he knows so much about
4148.16s: this this field and then that led me to
4151.44s: um another Mentor Tom McNair and then
4154.80s: that led me to another Mentor Bill Ray
4156.96s: and then I trained under Joe MCM monacle
4158.88s: and took his classes and you know I've
4161.44s: uh been taking some of LM Buchanan's
4163.40s: classes and um and so so I just started
4166.80s: gaining this knowledge and the goal was
4169.76s: how do we get youth to have these
4172.52s: experiences in a controlled manner that
4175.08s: allow them to explore this and then
4177.96s: hopefully grow up with this you know
4180.00s: because a lot of the people I taught to
4181.92s: find it much later in life you know and
4185.00s: and but if we can get little ones to
4187.04s: really enjoy and grow in that power then
4189.64s: that would be ideal and that also L me
4191.52s: to mindsight too um that same Quest so
4195.04s: yeah is that like the hot pink or red or
4198.64s: something like yes it is the hot pink uh
4201.32s: is that green yes it is okay orange yes
4206.52s: it is that's three in a row that you
4208.80s: have gotten right is that um is that
4211.48s: something you find because obviously
4213.56s: with the talk of psionics and this
4215.92s: recruitment you know they're saying
4217.60s: they're recruiting these uh children
4219.20s: from all around the world who have been
4220.64s: in traumatic events and have you also
4222.96s: seen like a correlation between the
4225.40s: strength of the
4226.76s: sigh in and like the age of the student
4230.48s: um I would say yes I think that the kids
4234.24s: that
4235.08s: I there's there's a weird dynamic
4237.88s: happening because there's still so many
4239.96s: adults who don't believe right and youth
4244.08s: are mirror they're mirror neurons which
4246.84s: help them succeed in in adapt to life
4250.44s: they're watching the people in their
4251.92s: environment and they're gaining a lot of
4253.92s: their perspective based off those people
4256.68s: and so chances are if Mom and Dad really
4259.68s: don't believe in this that kid is going
4261.80s: to have some struggles really
4263.84s: understanding even if they have an event
4265.96s: if they have that first timer effect
4267.64s: where they just like knock it out of the
4269.28s: park after that it may diminish because
4272.12s: their environment doesn't support it or
4274.08s: doesn't really talk about it or do it or
4276.40s: whatever and so I have seen that youth
4280.52s: are willing to try a lot easier and dive
4283.60s: into and and have success but I also see
4286.88s: diminish it diminish in some youth based
4289.76s: on the fact that their family doesn't
4292.52s: you know follow that script um and
4295.44s: here's a perfect example of that is that
4298.40s: I had these kids that I was working with
4300.76s: I call it gut training so I don't cross
4302.76s: any lines or anything with uh other type
4305.64s: of belief systems and stuff so I just
4307.48s: say hey we're learning gut training how
4309.08s: do you you know which is true
4311.56s: self-defense right how do I Instinct
4313.76s: yeah Instinct I'm I'm looking at this
4315.52s: person who's smiling at me and really in
4317.20s: the back of their mind and heart they
4319.16s: want to kidnap me and take me away from
4321.12s: my family but they're saying all the
4323.04s: right things Hey kid I'm your buddy you
4324.80s: know here take this so I have to use
4326.84s: something else to help me feel that out
4329.32s: and Instinct in my gut will tell me
4331.40s: through this intuition that this
4333.40s: person's not right but my logic brain
4335.44s: because I don't want to use my intuition
4337.28s: anymore because my immediate environment
4339.68s: at home tells me that that that's crap
4342.08s: and we don't do that then I go along
4344.84s: with it and now I'm I'm gone right so I
4347.60s: I say hey we're just trying to build up
4349.28s: that gut and your instinct and get you
4351.28s: that that uh that intuition that you
4353.56s: need to kind of survive these threats
4356.32s: you know but really I'm trying to get
4358.12s: them to a different place but I'm using
4359.84s: that as a means a vehicle to help them
4362.40s: grow not to cut you off but uh just so
4364.80s: everyone's aware you teach a lot of this
4367.56s: stuff you you have you have students of
4369.24s: all different age groups yes and you
4371.40s: teach the ninja stuff the mindsight
4373.24s: stuff and this particular thing so just
4375.28s: for those of you listening um you're
4377.60s: you've been doing you've been teaching
4378.60s: for how long now uh I've had my school
4381.32s: in operation for 17 years yeah um I've
4384.44s: been teaching for probably 20 years
4387.56s: maral Arts yeah or more yeah all right
4389.76s: sorry to cut you off but I did feel like
4391.64s: that was important to get out of the way
4392.72s: that people understand that like you're
4394.16s: not just telling some random kids to
4395.68s: like trust her gut that you have a
4397.48s: school and you've been doing this for a
4398.68s: long time I that was my bad I didn't I
4400.24s: didn't set that up okay yeah no problem
4402.40s: thanks for going back to to make sure
4404.88s: that you know I don't get beat up on the
4408.00s: Internet um yeah so that I had this kid
4412.56s: in there and they're playing these games
4414.72s: and I put a blindfold on and they got to
4416.88s: like do stuff and you know with the
4418.72s: blindfold and um I one day was like hey
4423.36s: let's have your moms do it you know that
4425.72s: are out there watching us and the kids
4427.32s: were like yeah I want to get mom
4428.52s: involved so they go and grab Mom Moms
4430.28s: come out there put the mask on Mom some
4433.60s: moms are doing well another mom is doing
4435.72s: well and then one of them takes the mask
4438.04s: off and she says you
4439.76s: know I thought he was pretending this
4442.20s: whole time I thought it was fake I
4444.08s: thought he was had to be peeking through
4446.64s: the mask she's like but you can't see
4448.80s: anything through that thing so then that
4451.20s: gave me this kind of that kind of gave
4452.88s: me this epiphany of like wow you know
4456.36s: what she basically just said without
4458.04s: saying was that at
4460.64s: home she's she's thinking it's just all
4464.24s: made up and
4465.72s: yeah and if he's at home with her most
4468.12s: of the time if he's like hey I want to
4470.16s: do gut training she's like oh yeah we
4471.76s: don't do that pretend stuff you just do
4473.32s: that when you're at the martial arts
4474.84s: school and that that could potentially
4477.12s: shut down that that youth wanting to
4479.48s: explore that and wanting to grow in that
4482.16s: and so again that was my initial way
4485.16s: into me wanting to get deeper into
4487.56s: remote viewing um but also for me
4490.64s: personally in my life I am truly trying
4492.88s: to follow this ninja path and and so
4496.32s: these nine abilities that they had I'm
4499.64s: really trying to embody that and then go
4503.08s: down that Pro go through the process of
4504.88s: doing that because this was these nine
4507.24s: of once
4508.40s: you obtained or was able to really
4511.40s: really grow in these nine abilities it
4513.96s: was what they call you you become what
4516.16s: they call a tagen which is like this
4518.56s: fully actualized human being right um
4521.76s: well-rounded person well rounded and and
4523.80s: I've also studied and and training yoga
4526.92s: and you know we have the gross plane a
4529.24s: subtle plane and the causal plane and
4531.28s: you you exploring all of those and
4535.32s: really getting to a point where you
4537.32s: embody all of those takes you to this
4539.68s: other level where you're in this really
4542.16s: um your fully actualized human being you
4544.80s: know you're somebody who can really
4546.72s: explore all aspects of what it means to
4549.04s: be human uh which is the term yoga which
4552.56s: means to join or to or Union right um
4555.88s: you're joining all of who you are
4558.04s: together so it's not just me being
4560.20s: physical or it's not just me being gross
4562.80s: and gross uh subtle plane or or a gross
4566.20s: plane it's or it's not me just being in
4567.88s: a subtle plane It's Me weaving together
4570.28s: all those in a very nice balance and
4573.96s: really fully exploring what all that
4576.04s: means and how they all interrelate you
4578.88s: know so that we operate very well and
4580.80s: efficiently and to our greatest
4583.36s: potential um and that's that's what my
4586.72s: goal is personally for my own life and I
4589.48s: see that if I can give even a little one
4593.72s: one extra Taste of another aspect of
4597.52s: their you know multi-dimensional nature
4599.96s: then I've done my job hopefully as an
4601.92s: instructor or a teacher for that
4603.40s: person's life and I've also helped bring
4606.08s: into the world someone who's going to be
4609.32s: um a more powerful being who hopefully
4612.92s: fights for um when I say fight I don't
4615.88s: mean like but you know really pushes for
4619.44s: more light in the world and more love in
4621.40s: the world because they recognize their
4624.60s: own full they they recognize a little
4626.88s: bit more about the magnitude of who they
4628.88s: really are which helps them recognize
4632.52s: the magnitude of what they really are in
4635.12s: the grand scheme of things and how all
4637.16s: that connects to one another wow I mean
4640.32s: that's a that's a lofty
4642.80s: goal but I I think you know
4645.40s: I've seen you I've seen the videos You'
4646.76s: sent me where you know you're with your
4648.68s: students and they're doing the mindsight
4650.40s: things and for those who aren't aware
4652.12s: there are these things called mindfold
4653.60s: which are like blindfolds but better uh
4655.72s: they're completely blackout I use them
4657.72s: actually for meditating because no light
4660.16s: gets in in these things there's no
4661.60s: peaking like I mean okay sure there's
4663.48s: ways you can probably rig it up I'm a
4664.88s: magician right like I mean I can I can
4667.44s: make a blindfold that I can look through
4669.12s: okay but that's not what these are and
4672.24s: it's completely dark like no lights
4674.08s: getting in
4675.72s: and these kids and these students what
4678.44s: they're doing is they have colors in
4681.20s: front of them and then they have a pile
4683.52s: of like cardboard papers or whatever and
4686.08s: they're kind of sensing somehow
4688.56s: perceiving in some cases I guess even
4690.92s: seeing in their Mind's Eye what colors
4694.40s: these papers are and they're putting
4695.72s: them in the right piles and uh you know
4697.80s: there's there's some examples of that in
4699.64s: um the telepathy tapes as well which was
4702.32s: really cool to see and you know when I
4706.04s: see this man like I I'm not alone in
4709.40s: thinking and being skeptical when I see
4711.36s: this right because I if I've seen some
4713.80s: pretty incredible stuff and when I look
4715.80s: at that I'm like that's so insane yeah
4718.96s: that like my brain glitches out and it
4721.12s: goes straight to aam's Razer and aam's
4724.48s: Razer tells me you can see it yeah
4726.16s: you're cheating right that's aam's Razer
4728.64s: but in this case they're not and it's
4730.88s: just so hard to reconcile as an adult
4734.12s: who you know
4735.72s: has a view of reality walks around every
4737.88s: day it's hard for an adult to reconcile
4740.08s: that yeah how does that fit in my
4741.80s: reality now yeah like how does that even
4744.32s: work so when you're doing these um
4748.48s: exercises do you first of all this has
4751.64s: happened to you too you do you practice
4753.32s: this yeah yeah what is that like is that
4755.84s: is it a sensation is it a vibration is
4758.24s: it a sense like how does that
4761.76s: work I think your there your question is
4765.52s: huge and it has many layers to it and
4768.64s: the first layer is when we look at it
4771.44s: and we think there got to be something
4774.16s: more I don't understand you know right
4776.24s: there was a time I would stray to say in
4779.40s: human history where that wasn't that
4783.04s: wasn't the case oh the shaman the this
4786.92s: the that those coming in this is my
4790.08s: theory um I think it's a little more
4792.04s: than a theory but I want to stay open
4794.96s: those coming in the
4796.76s: children spent most of their time with
4799.64s: those going out the
4801.84s: grandparents and these tribes and these
4804.12s: small communities or groups or
4806.20s: whatever and the grandparents the kids
4809.60s: have this unique perspective because
4811.52s: they're not really Bound by the world
4814.12s: and then the grandparents those who are
4816.04s: going out are losing you know their
4818.88s: binds of the world they're going back to
4821.44s: source and these guys are coming out of
4823.24s: source and then the people in between
4825.04s: the parents are hunting and fishing and
4827.56s: building and doing those things they may
4829.92s: still believe in those things but they
4831.44s: have job they have things that they got
4832.96s: to do to make sure that the village
4834.56s: survives so the youth are getting
4836.80s: trained by those individuals these older
4839.40s: individuals and then as they come into
4841.76s: adulthood they have that understanding
4843.96s: already I think it was supported back
4845.56s: then and then they had Shaman and
4846.96s: Medicine people who were helping and and
4849.40s: so they were a lot more in
4851.16s: tune but now in this Paradigm you know
4854.44s: we
4855.20s: we are a lot more skeptical uh because
4858.44s: we live in this kind of materialistic
4860.44s: reductionistic society and science has
4862.72s: really helped us come along in some ways
4865.36s: but I mean you know we've
4869.80s: had all of these experiences in science
4874.40s: where we thought [ __ ] was not real where
4877.80s: we said it can't be that the earth goes
4881.84s: around the Sun that there's no such
4884.20s: thing as things in the air called germs
4886.20s: we can't see that can infect people and
4888.24s: do all that stuff and we'll kill you for
4890.08s: it if you say it again you know and then
4895.40s: somehow that flipped overh and so I only
4898.84s: wanted to talk about that point because
4901.28s: you know there are people who still say
4903.28s: no no that can't be that can't be it's
4905.60s: it's got to be them tricking and playing
4907.64s: and so on and so forth but then that
4910.00s: maybe I don't think that's how we always
4912.44s: thought I think that was probably lead a
4914.88s: minority at some point in time and the
4916.64s: majority was like yeah of course you
4918.44s: know like yeah we can talk to you know
4920.80s: I've talked to a Native American man who
4922.56s: said oh yeah the ancestors used to talk
4924.72s: about like how did you know you could
4926.20s: eat that plant in that one was it just
4927.80s: that everybody died who did who who ate
4930.08s: that one and then enough people said it
4931.88s: and then they said and these guys would
4933.72s: say no the plant told us W and now we
4936.56s: have all this research coming out that's
4938.12s: saying like plant were these sentient
4939.68s: beings and that they're communicating
4941.52s: with each other and that you know
4943.56s: there's melium under the ground that's
4945.36s: telling this tree over here and this
4947.08s: tree a thousand miles away like what's
4948.96s: on its way and we can prove that and you
4952.04s: know but these old ancient people were
4954.52s: saying oh yeah they're like oh you're
4957.08s: just figuring that out you know like
4959.24s: we've been writing about this and
4960.88s: telling it in what we call in J in
4963.12s: Japanese martial arts the the okuden
4965.16s: like this this verbal
4967.00s: transmission for for Generations but
4969.96s: you're just figuring that out like yeah
4971.76s: we don't need to understand the science
4974.12s: to use it yes yeah or to have I mean
4977.80s: what is Faith to have that belief that
4980.24s: it's there and and and understand that
4983.08s: but I I wanted to definitely preface
4986.72s: that and and say like okay yeah there's
4989.64s: there's that and then there's okay well
4992.96s: what is happening when I do my mindsight
4996.64s: when I do my remote viewing and I can
4998.32s: tell you it's really odd it's a knowing
5001.76s: and a lot of people have been using that
5003.92s: the more I've been in a circle where
5005.56s: it's just an knowing and I remember my
5007.16s: teacher Paul saying Paul Smith he would
5009.56s: say if you think that it is this color
5013.48s: or if it's the the shape this shape or
5016.36s: whatever you're probably wrong if you
5018.84s: feel like it is though you're probably
5021.20s: right so if you're like I don't even
5023.80s: understand why I'm writing I I I don't
5025.88s: know I just feel like I should write
5027.12s: square and and I don't know and and I've
5029.56s: seen people when they first learn they
5031.08s: go through that I don't know stage what
5033.24s: what do you mean write something down
5034.92s: yeah tell me what's in the box how am I
5036.32s: going to tell you in the Box just write
5037.96s: the first thing that comes to mind no I
5039.60s: I don't understand you know and they
5041.12s: just start writing and they're like I
5043.20s: don't get it what am I supposed to be
5044.36s: writing here uh you know well what what
5046.88s: what colors come to mind oh blue but why
5049.40s: why why blue uh black why why black you
5051.72s: know and they just they're just fighting
5053.80s: it their logic is just like resisting
5056.20s: and then you open the box and they're
5058.12s: like holy but Jesus that's what happened
5060.44s: to me that's a that's you feel so silly
5064.64s: doing these things and and and you know
5066.68s: there is that um uh that that sort of
5070.28s: Detachment from what it used to be where
5072.44s: you used to be like feel empowered with
5074.00s: these things now you do feel silly like
5076.24s: you know you're forced to feel silly
5077.44s: you're kind of bullied into thinking
5079.28s: that this isn't real right so um I
5082.08s: remember doing the sessions and during
5084.00s: the sessions I would always like I'd
5085.68s: meditate and i' I'd feel good right and
5088.48s: and like like you said like sometimes
5090.00s: you just know you're like that's a I'm
5092.12s: getting a really like good feeling about
5093.68s: this and like you'll just do it whatever
5095.52s: and then as soon as it's done I'm like H
5098.04s: and then it's time to open the envelope
5099.24s: and I always be
5100.72s: like oh no that's probably all wrong and
5104.20s: then the doubt would sink in and then
5105.64s: I'd be like no this is stupid I'm stupid
5107.96s: what am I doing this is not going to
5109.24s: work and then I start doubting myself
5110.92s: but then I open the envelope and sure
5112.88s: little lo and behold like I was like
5115.32s: whoa but like I I go through that phase
5118.16s: that doubt phase after yeah not during
5121.20s: it's just right before opening the
5122.32s: envelope and I'm like I'm going to look
5123.44s: so dumb there's going to I'm look like
5124.76s: there's egg on my face like this is
5125.88s: going to this is going to suck yeah and
5127.72s: yeah it turns out that like that that
5129.56s: knowing really does translate and
5132.40s: another thing I found out is like after
5133.72s: doing it a lot you would start to
5136.76s: recognize that knowing yes there is and
5139.16s: that's the practice yeah and I I only
5141.16s: found that out after because I was like
5142.64s: how do you practice just like gut
5144.56s: checking things and well you remember
5148.44s: how it is you felt when a piece of
5150.84s: information gets confirmed you remember
5153.20s: what that felt like when you perceive it
5154.60s: the first time and so when it happens
5156.12s: again you go oh and you get excited and
5157.92s: then you do it and then you find it oh
5159.44s: and it doesn't always match but
5160.68s: sometimes and then you you start to uh
5163.68s: build a sort of repertoire of these
5166.36s: senses and how that you know how those
5168.84s: made you feel and but I also found out
5171.64s: that relying too much on that isn't good
5173.16s: either because then you start getting
5174.20s: overconfident the ego gets in the way
5175.96s: and it's so touchy yeah um yeah and
5179.88s: that's and I mean that that can be
5181.72s: related to how does a person know when
5183.60s: they shoot to three-point shot that it's
5185.96s: going to make it and when you talk when
5187.96s: I played basketball and then also talked
5190.28s: to people who would play basketball
5192.28s: there'd be times I I remember this guy
5194.16s: he almost all the time from the three
5197.04s: the free throw line he'll he throw this
5198.80s: thing up um and he would make it in
5202.52s: there right and then he got to a point
5204.84s: where he would just come down the court
5206.48s: Throw It Up Turn Around run back and it
5208.44s: would it would just make it and we all
5210.32s: I'm sitting there in the center like w
5213.00s: waiting for the rebound and then I look
5215.08s: over and I see him walking back and then
5217.20s: I look up and it's like and I'm like how
5219.28s: did that dude know you know and they'll
5221.88s: just say like I don't know I just know
5223.72s: when I it just feels Everything feels
5225.76s: right when I put it in the air but they
5227.16s: still sometimes Miss right but they get
5230.20s: better at recognizing that sense
5232.32s: recognizing what it feels like when when
5234.80s: the knowing is happening and that and
5237.60s: giving us that opportunity to understand
5239.92s: that it's a story that I have that came
5241.64s: to mind when you were saying that where
5243.44s: I had an employee once and I noticed he
5246.56s: would get this one meal and every time
5248.64s: he would get this meal he would start it
5250.52s: would he would gargle a little bit when
5251.88s: he talked like he had flim in his throat
5253.96s: and I was and and he he'd start coughing
5256.64s: and one day I said to him I said you
5258.08s: know did you ever notice when you eat
5259.72s: that um that that meal you're
5262.56s: eating that you start getting a lot of
5265.32s: flim and you know you start coughing a
5267.36s: lot and he was like no I don't I don't
5270.56s: think that's he's like no i' never
5272.56s: noticed that and I I don't think it's
5274.60s: there and I was like okay cool and I
5276.96s: just went on about my business and like
5278.48s: a month later he comes back to me and he
5280.08s: said you know what since you said it
5282.40s: that one time I've been paying attention
5284.04s: and every time I eat it I get tons of
5287.28s: flim and all this stuff and so yeah that
5290.92s: changed my perspective right so I
5293.16s: brought his awareness and his attention
5294.76s: to it and he was aware enough to go back
5298.24s: and like pay attention to it and then he
5300.56s: was able to work something out where now
5303.40s: he knows that that um he's not going to
5305.36s: feel too well after he eats this meal
5308.36s: you know and that sometimes is why
5311.08s: having a good teacher is important
5313.60s: because they can help you have those
5315.68s: moments um and or just being able to be
5319.64s: mindful and pay attention to what's what
5321.92s: what's happening in your world and
5324.44s: that's part of the growth in these
5326.32s: skills is having that
5329.40s: awareness of when the knowing is
5331.76s: happening cuz at first it's like I don't
5333.60s: know what's going on it just and then
5336.00s: after a while you start having that
5337.72s: moment where you're like oh every time I
5340.32s: kind of feel this little thing then
5343.60s: that's happening and we see that with
5344.96s: the mindsight too we'll have people like
5346.68s: use their hand and they'll look for
5348.72s: things and I talk to people and I'll say
5351.68s: hey like how did you know and they're
5353.24s: like oh one kid was telling me they feel
5355.80s: like somebody pressing on their hand and
5358.72s: I was like oh okay and then I've had
5361.24s: kids who start with her like I don't
5363.00s: know I just knew it was there and then
5364.88s: later they'll be like you know I was
5366.64s: thinking about what you said and every
5367.92s: time I get over the bag it gets my hand
5369.88s: gets really cold you know and I'm like
5372.08s: oh okay cool let's you know let's pay
5374.36s: attention to that for next time then
5376.24s: they're paying attention now so and then
5378.44s: their stats get higher and higher
5380.56s: because now they have the understanding
5382.64s: of what that signal is and then go from
5385.04s: there and then there's this thing where
5387.04s: uh you know we call it your
5389.16s: language sometimes their language
5390.88s: changed so now it's not cold but it's
5392.64s: hot you know and and then they're like
5394.64s: oh man I'm getting it wrong I'm getting
5396.12s: it wrong and then they start getting
5398.36s: them right and I say well what happened
5399.68s: between when you getting it wrong well I
5401.32s: remember it used to get cold but then
5403.20s: today for whatever reason it's not
5405.04s: getting cold anymore but it gets hot and
5407.36s: so I started choosing hot and then I was
5409.44s: getting them right and it's like oh okay
5411.28s: well isn't that interesting that we
5413.96s: change as individuals from a day-to-day
5416.36s: basis right um You you have different
5420.40s: days where you're susceptible to more
5422.52s: things or you feel different way based
5424.52s: on how you went to bed how much sleep
5426.20s: you got maybe what your chemistry is on
5428.12s: that day and we do know that that's a
5430.20s: fact that nobody you're not your
5432.88s: Constitution isn't always 100% the same
5435.68s: as the day before as it is today um
5438.04s: based on all of these this Balancing Act
5440.44s: that's going on in your body the signal
5441.80s: is so faint M that any like little bit
5447.56s: of lack of sleep or you ate too much or
5450.08s: you're not feeling too well like any of
5451.80s: that is going to affect the signal or
5454.04s: sort of how you perceive the signal
5456.56s: right um is there okay I I I'm so
5460.52s: fascinated by this stuff like there
5461.96s: there's so many things I want to get to
5463.48s: but I do want to transition from here uh
5466.12s: in a second but first I want to ask just
5468.56s: for the audience at home is there like a
5470.12s: cool remote viewing story that you have
5472.60s: personally that you did that you like
5474.28s: knocked your socks off that knocked my
5476.80s: socks
5478.52s: off I would say it's when I watch other
5481.04s: people uh there's several people I know
5483.08s: that are really really good but I'd say
5485.20s: probably the one the the time I was the
5487.92s: most impressed with my remote viewing
5490.56s: was the time I was the most stressed and
5493.56s: so um I was trying to get this homework
5496.16s: done for Paul he has this like his
5498.44s: program is super intensive it's amazing
5500.28s: you know you got a bunch of homework you
5501.76s: got to do once you get done with the
5503.28s: program and you the only way you can
5505.44s: make it to the next level is if you do
5507.12s: all that homework and and so um I I
5511.16s: believe yeah it was I was about to take
5513.40s: his level to his intermediate course but
5515.28s: I had like one more homework assignment
5517.04s: done and I was in I'm in school for
5519.28s: Integrative Health Medicine I'm I got my
5521.92s: businesses I got all this stuff going on
5524.24s: and I just wasn't able to get that last
5525.96s: one done and it's only like two days
5527.68s: before I'm supposed to fly out and so
5530.00s: I'm thinking he's going to either make
5531.36s: me do it when I get there or
5534.04s: whatever excuse me so I'm like oh man I
5537.72s: got to get this done I'm stressed I'm
5539.44s: like oh you know I got I got like five
5541.48s: minutes maybe 10 minutes to get this
5543.00s: thing done and you know but when you do
5544.60s: CRV it's a pretty it could be a pretty
5546.56s: lengthy process you got to go through so
5548.36s: I'm like I'm going just have to do it
5550.12s: and whatever comes out comes out and
5551.76s: then at least he'll tell me I'm wrong
5553.24s: but I'll have it in you know like so I'm
5555.08s: gaming it in my mind and I'm sitting
5557.24s: there I'm at the table I'm super
5558.72s: stressed I don't do a cool down I don't
5560.44s: try to get in the zone I'm just like all

5567.76s: right I'm done I'm just going to submit
5569.08s: it and I opened the thing up and that
5571.60s: was the best remote viewing I have ever

5576.00s: the times when I like tried to get in
5577.60s: the zone and like sit down and take my
5581.00s: time and
5582.32s: focus yeah I didn't do as good as when I
5585.44s: was like under pressure under pressure
5588.52s: in it you know just didn't care this
5591.48s: goes back to this goes to another story
5594.16s: so I'm going to segue into the story
5596.32s: about when I got my fifth degree black
5597.84s: Bel and ninjitsu so I'm I'm going for my
5601.04s: I failed the first two times I went for
5602.92s: this test so we in Ninjutsu we have the
5606.44s: five elements right this five Elemental
5608.48s: manifestation which you know you can
5610.12s: find in Chinese stuff and in Indian uh
5612.96s: Hindu uh uh faiths or beliefs and so we
5618.96s: have these five elements and getting to
5621.92s: your black belt you go from Earth to
5623.92s: water to fire to wind to void right and
5626.92s: then you get a black belt and that's the
5628.80s: Mastery levels and then first degree
5630.92s: black belt is Advanced Earth second
5633.16s: degree is advaned water Advance you know
5636.32s: so here I am I'm at this you know fourth
5639.60s: degree black belt and I'm in here and
5642.28s: I'm trying to you know get through this
5645.40s: this process and I'm I've been in this
5648.52s: kind of like fire mode right so actually
5651.36s: is Mastery then it's then it's uh a
5654.12s: second degree is like Advanced Earth or
5655.76s: whatever and so I'm in this fire mode
5659.12s: and I'm like every time I come to the
5660.96s: test I'm like super athletic and I'm
5663.24s: like you know doing this stuff and I'm
5665.84s: just like all over it right and they're
5668.24s: like nope you don't pass you did good
5671.68s: nobody hit you you were like connected
5674.36s: you're in there you're doing all this
5675.80s: stuff but nah you didn't pass yet and so
5678.96s: I'm like what I didn't pass like this is
5681.12s: crazy like what what's going on they're
5683.48s: like you need to be more free you need
5684.88s: to let go you need to kind of just move
5686.80s: with it you need to be a part of this
5688.52s: thing and I'm like I'm like what and
5691.28s: they're like like when you you're trying
5693.12s: to get to win you're trying to
5694.48s: transition into the next piece and so
5698.44s: I'm like I don't I don't get it you know
5701.52s: so then I try another time and I fell
5703.56s: again and I'm like and that time I was
5705.48s: like really trying to get the stuff down
5707.36s: and I'm like you know so I really got to
5709.76s: a point where I was like well fourth
5711.88s: degree black belt is enough I don't need
5714.36s: to be wrapped up in these belt things
5716.68s: you know I'm not going to test anymore
5718.88s: I'm going to try one more time and if I
5720.48s: don't do it then all right whatever I
5722.68s: still love my teacher I love the people
5724.24s: I'm training with I'll just train and
5725.84s: I'm just done with testing now I'm going
5728.24s: just be a fourth degree forever so I go
5730.64s: to the that final test and I'm like you
5733.96s: know my friend's like are you going to
5735.56s: test today I was like yeah but he's like
5738.00s: are you nervous or anything I said no
5740.04s: bro I'm telling you as my witness if I
5743.04s: don't pass today that's fine I don't
5745.84s: care I don't care whatever happens to
5747.80s: day happens right and I was just really
5749.32s: adamant about that and really laid back
5752.08s: and I'm watching all other people test
5754.20s: and we have to do randor what they call
5756.20s: free response so all these people come
5757.84s: out and they're like trying to punch you
5759.00s: and kick you and is not choreographed
5761.28s: you just got to like Freestyle Freestyle
5763.56s: right and it's not oneon-one it's like
5766.08s: people coming at you you know are they
5768.08s: actually trying to hit you yeah they got
5769.60s: gloves on and they're trying to punch
5771.08s: you and you know yes for real whoa and
5774.24s: so um so I get up there and I fix my
5777.84s: uniform I'm stand out there and like
5779.96s: every all of the senior this because I I
5782.12s: was a I'm a senior black Bel at that
5783.80s: time so only seniors attack you so
5785.76s: people your level Above So Juniors don't
5788.64s: attack you normally you don't get like a
5790.12s: first degree or second degree because
5792.80s: every you know the things you might do
5794.64s: are too may be too intense for them at
5797.20s: that stage and so you get fourth degrees
5800.32s: fifth degrees Sixth Degrees attacking
5802.28s: you if you're going for a fifth degree
5803.84s: you get what I'm saying yep and so I'm
5806.84s: out there and they say go and
5810.44s: then stuff is happening uh I
5814.20s: guess and then they like stop and I'm
5818.64s: like and then my teacher comes up behind
5820.88s: me Taps me on the shoulder with this
5822.68s: this sword and then I'm it's the sword
5825.48s: test and you got to like feel the
5827.68s: intention his murderous intent and then
5829.48s: you move out of the way at just the
5830.92s: right time the first two times I failed
5833.56s: miserably right and he Ted me on the
5836.28s: shoulder to let me know that any moment
5838.16s: now this could happen and then all of a
5839.96s: sudden I just move out of the way and I
5843.84s: look to my left and the sword is right
5845.72s: where I was standing and then I hear
5847.80s: everybody like whoa they're clapping
5849.96s: they're like yeah and I and I'm like
5852.52s: snap out of it and my friend runs up to
5854.44s: me and he's like bro that was the most
5856.56s: amazing thing I ever saw and in my brain
5859.28s: and in my heart I was
5861.28s: like what the [ __ ] just
5863.56s: happened I lost all time like I have no
5866.72s: clue to this day like when I took my my
5869.64s: the test the first two times I can tell
5871.40s: you every move I made every move he made
5875.08s: everything that happened it wasn't until
5877.12s: I let
5878.24s: go that and I really embodied letting go
5881.72s: that I became the wind which is our
5883.76s: element where you're like a leaf in the
5885.92s: wind the leaf in the wind is not trying
5888.24s: to control the wind Leaf in the wind is
5890.64s: Flowing With the Wind wherever the wind
5892.40s: is pushing that's where it goes you know
5894.76s: and I was like and that's what happened
5896.16s: and then my friend Rick comes up to me
5897.80s: and he's like bro I thought I thought I
5899.92s: was going to make you fail I said how
5902.04s: he's like there of time I was like I
5905.84s: just was in the energy of everything
5908.04s: that was going on I came up I saw you I
5910.44s: went to punch you and I was like oh no
5912.76s: he's not going to move I'm going to
5913.88s: punch him right in the face and it's
5914.92s: going to make him fa his test and he's
5917.08s: like I he's like I didn't know what to
5918.96s: do I was just like it's
5920.96s: coming I put everything into that punch
5923.80s: and he said and you disappeared and I
5926.28s: was on the floor and he said do you
5927.96s: remember that I said no I don't remember
5930.00s: that at all he was like it was amazing I
5932.56s: was on the floor like how did I get here
5934.52s: and I'm like I'm like whoa I'm like are
5936.60s: you sure you were trying he was like bro
5938.24s: I thought I was going to be the reason
5940.36s: you failed and he was like and then you
5942.40s: were just gone and I was like Wow and I
5946.12s: didn't think about anything I just knew
5948.76s: my body knew what it needed to do you
5951.24s: know I was beyond re I was beyond
5953.76s: reasoning or thinking through the thing
5956.16s: and having to do the thing I had let go
5959.24s: just like in that moment I'm like hey
5961.00s: yeah I don't care you know I just got to
5962.52s: get this done I'm I'm I got to get it
5964.72s: turned into Paul so I can do this class
5967.12s: I don't care what whatever comes out
5969.12s: okay even if I I'm probably going to get
5970.52s: it wrong all right
5972.04s: whatever boom it's the best one I ever
5974.68s: did two things yeah
5977.16s: stress and letting go letting go so
5979.88s: those two factors that's really
5982.08s: interesting it's almost like this uh
5984.08s: neutral mind State yeah under
5988.24s: duress that's a hard combo which obvious
5991.00s: which oddly Jake Barber talked about
5993.72s: that's that's where I was going yeah
5995.04s: that's exactly where I was going they
5996.12s: would induce stress but also like calm
5998.08s: you down and like so that's like the
5999.84s: pocket that's the Zone that's the Zone
6001.72s: wow
6002.80s: okay
6004.44s: interesting um all right let's get into
6007.60s: talking about um let's get into talking
6010.12s: about side games yeah I'm really excited
6012.56s: for this uh side
6014.84s: games the pretty much the psychic
6017.60s: Olympics is the elevator pitch as we
6019.28s: said which is amazing a lot of amazing
6021.72s: speakers are going to be there um who
6024.48s: else you got there you got you got uh
6026.08s: sha web's going to be there Chris bledo
6028.84s: um Tom Campbell Tom Campell oh wow Tom
6032.36s: Campbell y um Diane Dr Diane Powell wow
6036.64s: yeah so we we have some big names allar
6038.76s: lineup yeah Allstar lineup of people
6040.56s: coming to talk and and to share and
6044.20s: teach like yourself yep yeah I'm coming
6047.28s: to do some I'm coming to talk about you
6048.92s: know some some stuff uh correlating to
6052.32s: the art of magic and and uh and that
6055.00s: that'll be a lot of fun but um I think
6057.32s: for the most part what I'm mostly
6058.80s: excited about is for the very first time
6061.60s: we're going to have or see a competitive
6066.16s: psychic event can you walk us through
6070.40s: what exactly that's going to look like
6072.92s: yeah um you mean the games themselves or
6077.28s: so the games I can't really expand upon
6080.28s: just to make sure people don't start
6082.56s: like cheating yeah cheating and training
6084.64s: for the game so we're kind of keeping
6086.20s: those secret but on the website we do
6088.24s: have like a brief synopsis of like what
6091.08s: it what it might be about and give you
6093.08s: some practices that you can do
6094.96s: meditatively to kind of help you get
6097.68s: better at the skill you will need to can
6100.92s: can you let us know what the uh what the
6104.04s: I guess what the um what the categories
6106.52s: are yes test so they are five categories
6110.00s: and they are remote viewing mindsight
6113.60s: precognition psychokinesis and pendulum
6117.08s: dowsing and so I chose all five of those
6120.08s: because they it when more you talk to
6122.20s: people it seems like they kind of share
6124.12s: like a Common Thread between all of them
6126.52s: like if you talk about remote viewing
6128.40s: some people think that it's it has a lot
6130.56s: to do with precognition especially if
6132.44s: you get your feedback you know you might
6134.08s: be seeing the future your future
6136.40s: feedback um mindsight if you do that
6139.92s: enough sometimes you don't actually see
6141.84s: the item you actually just know it's a
6144.16s: cup you get what I'm saying so you're
6146.20s: like you got this local awareness almost
6148.16s: like remote viewing would be non-local
6150.08s: awareness you know you're feeling or or
6152.88s: perceiving something at a distance and
6155.12s: so you know there's there's those
6157.28s: threads and so then you got these we
6160.32s: have individual competitions and we have
6162.56s: Team competitions and so if you have a
6164.68s: team of five people the person who the
6167.72s: team deems is the best at remote viewing
6170.16s: will compete in a remote viewing
6171.60s: challenges against other individuals
6174.04s: from other teams and if you are the best
6176.92s: in Minds side you know you would compete
6179.08s: in that you know the person would choose
6180.96s: that and if you're just an individual
6182.56s: and you don't know anybody and you're
6183.92s: just like I do this stuff but I don't
6185.64s: have a team you can come and you can
6188.20s: compete in those different categories
6189.68s: against other people who are individuals
6191.28s: competing in those categories so that's
6193.76s: that's kind of how we um set it up and
6198.00s: yeah that's it's it's the psychic
6200.00s: Olympics man it's going to be great so
6202.08s: what um now here's the thing when when I
6205.44s: you know when you first hear about this
6206.60s: you might be like you know I'm sure some
6208.36s: of you are like hypers skeptical and
6210.04s: like you I mean this all just sounds
6212.12s: this all sounds a little too strange for
6213.36s: me yeah um but there is a point in doing
6215.84s: this and I really want you to explain
6218.48s: why you're doing this yeah because it
6220.92s: goes beyond just the sort of uh surface
6226.28s: level what this is the psychic it goes
6228.88s: beyond that yeah what's the point of
6230.92s: doing this so that's a
6233.92s: really beautiful question I I thank you
6235.96s: so much for asking that because like you
6237.84s: said we want to take it out of the Hokey
6239.48s: room and or the woooo right that's the
6242.56s: big term now um there's two points or
6246.40s: three points three reasons why I'm doing
6248.24s: this one is I'm a man of action what's
6250.44s: information without action so right now
6253.76s: you have all of this stuff coming out
6256.72s: about nhis and uaps and things of that
6259.60s: nature and waiting for disclosure and
6261.44s: but we have disclosure but we don't you
6263.24s: know and um and so the first one of the
6267.04s: first things is like well you don't
6269.52s: really need to it's it changes the game
6271.96s: when you can actually pick up the phone
6273.48s: and dial the person you know versus
6275.92s: waiting for that person to call you and
6278.88s: and to do that you have to have that
6281.40s: number you have to have that
6282.68s: relationship you know and so how do we
6285.72s: build the skills that we have the
6288.04s: abilities that we have that allow us to
6290.20s: really know what we need to know that
6292.20s: knowing right
6293.56s: and so well one way is that we have to
6295.96s: know what the standard is and then we
6299.64s: can start to build on that right and
6303.44s: that's one of my last reasons but I
6306.40s: wanted to bring it up first um because
6309.24s: of where we are and what we're talking
6310.80s: about my biggest reason first it came as
6314.92s: a download and I didn't want to believe
6317.60s: that it was it should be done CU I was
6319.52s: like nobody's ever done this before and
6321.16s: like you know and that's probably a
6322.40s: reason you you know like cuz it doesn't
6325.00s: make sense or something something and
6326.68s: I'm too busy and and then all these
6328.44s: synchronicities kept popping up where it
6330.28s: kept coming back into my life when you
6332.00s: say download through meditation yeah
6334.24s: well it wasn't actually like I was in
6336.32s: meditation I was in a moment I guess of
6339.68s: meditation while I was traveling and it
6342.68s: just popped into my head like literally
6344.80s: like as we were talking about mes
6347.40s: earlier or the idea of Genius right like
6350.68s: I'm just sitting there and it's like
6353.32s: [Laughter]
6355.32s: and I'm like whoa who's that who's that
6358.00s: and nobody's and and I'm just like whoa
6360.36s: you know like what is that like oh and
6362.36s: then details about what it could be why
6366.52s: it would be so on and so forth and I'm
6368.32s: like what is this what what's going on
6369.96s: I'm looking it up on my phone nobody's
6371.84s: done anything like this what is that
6373.48s: crazy that's what I started to say well
6376.68s: it's too big too big I can't do it and
6379.12s: then something else would happen and I'd
6380.96s: be like wow okay okay that that relates
6384.00s: back to the S no I'm too big I can't do
6386.04s: that something else will happen and I
6388.56s: think the final straw for me was um I
6392.80s: was listening to uh George knap and um
6397.24s: Jeremy corell's
6399.08s: weaponize
6400.60s: and there was a guy from the DIA who
6403.24s: wrote the he he's retired from the DIA
6405.64s: but he wrote Skin Walkers at the
6406.92s: Pentagon have you read that book I have
6408.48s: not that's a good book to read and he
6411.44s: was like and Jeremy Cor was like hey
6413.72s: you're talking about nhis and you're
6415.32s: talking about all these abilities and
6417.32s: these these things these
6418.48s: interdimensional beings might have this
6420.36s: and they can do this isn't that scary
6422.48s: isn't that like overwhelming and the guy
6425.36s: said no I see no fear here I see no
6428.28s: danger here he said a matter of fact and
6431.52s: he's like I can't say everything he said
6434.72s: but I will say this if humans could
6437.52s: operate at their full potential we
6439.96s: wouldn't have a reason to be
6441.84s: afraid and I was
6444.36s: like side
6447.36s: games I was like this is why do side
6449.44s: games have to happen we need to know
6451.76s: what those potentials are we need to
6453.76s: know who's operating at one of those
6455.96s: high levels and that will inspire the
6459.36s: Next Generation to move forward with
6462.08s: getting better it give people a purpose
6464.04s: a drive it'll motivate and this isn't a
6466.52s: fun way in our culture sometimes you say
6469.44s: the word competitive especially in the
6471.28s: conscious community and they're like oh
6472.96s: no you competitive we got to love
6474.80s: everybody and I'm like yeah competitive
6477.00s: is just a word and the culture you build
6480.08s: around that word can be destructive or
6482.60s: it can be
6484.20s: inspirational and so the people who are
6486.40s: involved in that culture of
6488.52s: competitiveness around love and
6490.96s: excitement and the celebration of
6493.48s: psychic abilities is what allows us to
6496.36s: really create a new paradigm which
6498.92s: allows people to feel okay exploring
6501.00s: those and growing in those ways right
6503.92s: and when you but you know if you just
6507.12s: say it's all you know it's it's got to
6509.36s: be all flowers and Rosy and stuff like
6511.44s: that yeah it does I want it to be love
6513.36s: and coherent and by the virtue of us
6516.00s: going inside to become better at those
6518.04s: things versus outside doing stuff on the
6520.76s: outside going to the Expo and listening
6523.00s: to you know such and such talk and so on
6525.60s: and so forth um the the fact of we're
6528.80s: setting people up to want to get better
6531.32s: which means that you have to do more
6532.88s: work on the inside of who you are and
6534.80s: all of the sages and everybody talks
6536.48s: about that you know nhi and
6539.12s: interdimensional beings sound very scary
6541.44s: like me playing basketball against um
6544.76s: Michael Jordan or going into the ring
6546.84s: with Mike Tyson I have no skills to be
6549.08s: able to deal with those folks you know
6551.16s: like they that's really scary I don't
6553.12s: know like what are they doing are they
6554.92s: scrambling my brain but when I have
6557.44s: mastered those elements that that will
6560.84s: allow me to walk in that Arena
6563.28s: then it's a different feeling it's a
6565.16s: different feeling and I only bring that
6566.92s: up just as an easy way not that this is
6568.72s: about fighting I'm just saying
6570.56s: that when I when I have raised my
6573.84s: vibration to a high level to where I see
6577.28s: something or I communicate with
6579.04s: something I'm a lot less
6580.72s: scared when I know who I truly am when
6584.68s: I'm not sure who I truly am and what I'm
6586.68s: capable of and what I'm able to be able
6589.84s: to do then I feel threatened that
6591.96s: something else can do something that I
6593.72s: feel like I can't do so how do we so
6597.12s: just like that guy said if we knew who
6598.96s: we truly were and we could explore who
6601.36s: we truly are and we were celebrated for
6605.64s: it then we take the next step and I
6608.80s: think I
6610.72s: think I always say if because I have my
6614.44s: belief obviously right but as a s guy I
6616.72s: say if NH are a real thing if
6619.72s: interdimensional beings are a real thing
6622.96s: then they're probably waiting for us to
6625.20s: do the
6626.72s: work you know to gain the abilities that
6631.24s: they say oh okay these people aren't
6633.84s: going to be afraid of me and try to kill
6635.32s: me if I show up at the doorstep now they
6638.04s: will
6639.04s: know they will have that knowing how do
6641.84s: I know what this thing is I just know
6644.80s: how do I know what I'm looking at all of
6646.52s: a sudden I just know because I've been
6649.00s: in this realm of doing the work to get
6651.96s: me to have a different way of seeing the
6654.04s: world to now I'm not threatened by that
6657.44s: becomes a threat when it's like just
6659.56s: comes out of nowhere and I'm like I
6660.92s: don't know what you are well kill it you
6662.92s: know like like shoot that thing you know
6665.52s: but when I realize I can too walk
6667.08s: through walls or I can too be in other
6668.96s: places or I can too see things that I'm
6671.32s: not supposed to then it's like oh I can
6673.36s: do that that's you know that's not
6675.60s: really that scary actually you know um
6678.12s: let's have a let's sit down and have a
6679.64s: conversation now you know you're you're
6681.64s: pretty interesting where you from uh
6683.40s: exor okay let's let's go ahead let's
6685.76s: have some coffee oh you don't drink
6687.08s: coffee like what do you drink you know
6689.00s: that's a different
6690.20s: conversation then you know it would be
6693.12s: if I don't have that so my thoughts were
6697.00s: how do I bring this to a community so I
6700.08s: started going to these different events
6701.60s: and I'm looking around and I'm following
6703.36s: I'm looking at my teacher and all of the
6705.48s: wonderful things that my teacher knows
6707.40s: Paul Smith and the Joe MCM monical and
6709.44s: all these folks that I've trained with
6711.36s: and I'm like whoa
6713.52s: not only are these people at these
6714.96s: conferences older even the people who
6717.80s: are teaching the stuff are older and
6720.64s: who've done this research over these
6722.32s: years and years and gone through all of
6724.60s: a ringer like uh Dr Diane pal where she
6728.08s: was losing her medical license because
6730.00s: she was like dude I'm doing great
6731.48s: research these guys didn't even read her
6733.08s: book they were just like oh you're
6734.32s: talking about ESP you're out of here you
6736.68s: know and then they read it and then they
6738.36s: were like oh she's actually done some
6739.80s: good research but that was 10 years
6741.16s: later right so all these people have
6743.36s: this wisdom this knowledge and they you
6746.44s: know by the timeline of what we think
6749.96s: you know the human body can live or on
6752.12s: their way out right in a couple years 20
6754.84s: years hopefully maybe more I I don't
6756.96s: want to wish anything negative on
6758.48s: anybody but just the reality harsh
6761.16s: reality or not harsh but the reality of
6763.56s: the world is that we have certain amount
6765.96s: of time in this Physical Realm and then
6768.52s: you have these kids that have these
6770.44s: abilities and they're all saying that
6772.60s: that these youth have these abilities
6774.68s: and then they lose it or they shut it
6776.20s: off and then I started looking into well
6778.36s: why are they shutting it off cuz we
6780.08s: don't have an arena or place that that
6783.08s: supports that in our society so it
6785.92s: doesn't seem like you can like make a
6788.64s: living or you can connect with other
6792.12s: people in a grand way at that age other
6795.48s: 15 year olds and 12 year olds and seven
6797.48s: year olds are like oh I want to play
6799.16s: Tekken or this video game or I want to
6801.80s: go play a sport you know and then you
6804.28s: have this kid that can hear things and
6806.52s: see things and then parents are back to
6810.16s: my experience you're just making that up
6813.40s: you're you're faking it that's not real
6815.88s: oh you go to your little karate class I
6818.48s: don't want use karate by the way but you
6820.24s: but most parents don't know so they're
6822.20s: like you go to your little karate class
6824.20s: put your little blindfold on and play
6825.64s: pretend for a little while that's cool
6827.32s: that's cute yeah go do that but then at
6829.60s: some point we got to have the real
6830.80s: conversation that that's all Bs and you
6832.64s: can't do that at all and the only way
6834.28s: you're really going to make it in the
6835.40s: world is to go out and get a job and do
6837.80s: this hard factual thing and then lose
6840.56s: that and then quite often I was meeting
6842.68s: people who now are in their 30s 40s 50s
6845.64s: 60s and they re they have that
6848.00s: Reawakening right and they say man when
6850.60s: I was a kid I could see through walls
6852.92s: bro you don't even understand I was like
6854.68s: seven I'm seeing people on the other
6856.72s: side of his wall and I'm trying to tell
6858.68s: my mom and they're just
6860.40s: like nah bro M yeah it's not working so
6863.96s: now I shut it off there's no Outlet yeah
6865.80s: there's no Outlet I shut it off and now
6867.88s: here I am at 40 and I'm I'm like no that
6870.80s: was real that was real now I'm back and
6873.88s: I'm I'm trying to learn it now man what
6876.00s: would the world be like if we had a
6877.88s: seven-year-old who had mentorship and
6880.32s: support and grew up with that knowledge
6882.92s: and was getting guidance from the old
6885.92s: ones going out like we talked about
6887.88s: earlier right about all the information
6890.44s: they accumulated over a lifetime of
6892.40s: research and study helping them move to
6894.84s: this next
6896.00s: level right yeah there's something
6898.24s: really special about the way that that's
6901.44s: structured too because you know we have
6904.52s: the James Randy and win a million
6906.24s: dollars if you can prove that you're a
6907.52s: psychic but you're already starting off
6909.12s: with a negative you're already you're
6910.68s: already starting off with a very
6912.12s: skeptical sort of look at it which is
6914.12s: fine You' be a skeptic all you want but
6916.56s: in this particular scenario it isn't
6918.40s: encouraging at all when the audience is
6920.40s: laughing at you and there's this whole
6922.56s: it's it's really built against you yeah
6925.80s: and then on the other side of that you
6928.16s: also have what now we're finding out
6930.36s: well we had C5 which was an encouraging
6932.92s: thing but the goal there was to make
6934.60s: contact with aliens and make these
6936.08s: lights appear which again is cool and
6938.32s: again that's what we're seeing with the
6939.44s: psionics team with Jake
6941.04s: Barber there's no place that really
6945.16s: allows you
6947.04s: to um push forward this idea
6952.48s: in a way that is just for just
6955.60s: beneficial for for us and not to you
6958.84s: know not simply to win money or not
6960.92s: simply to call aliens or to talk to
6963.20s: ghosts or whatever but it's just human
6965.76s: potential yeah and it's
6967.80s: encouraging and you know what the
6970.28s: beautiful part about this is is that I
6972.36s: know for a fact that no matter what
6974.68s: happens it was for a better cause it was
6978.80s: for the betterment of people and what's
6982.36s: the harm in that yeah you know what I
6984.36s: mean cuz the second you do that you
6986.84s: might be very very surprised by the
6988.96s: results yes and then those results you
6991.96s: know mark my words now when those
6994.52s: results get published and people go wait
6997.48s: what's happening at this side games
6999.32s: thing yeah these kids are doing what
7001.64s: these people are huh they got all that
7004.44s: right oh they they scored a perfect
7006.56s: score on this what and then the evidence
7009.56s: is there the video is there the the the
7012.44s: data is there because you're doing this
7014.40s: in a way that is pretty much um you know
7017.88s: not in a perfect vacuum because you know
7020.08s: there are you don't want to do this in a
7022.12s: lab because it's no fun yeah yeah uh but
7024.92s: pretty near yeah and you've even come to
7027.44s: me uh to make sure that there's no way
7029.80s: you can cheat on these things and as a
7031.80s: magician you know there's a lot of ways
7032.80s: you can cheat a lot of things so you
7034.20s: know I've I've helped you really look at
7036.24s: this and and you guys have been very
7037.72s: Vigilant on that and so right off the
7040.76s: gate you have to get that out of the way
7041.80s: you have to be like okayy we're we're
7042.96s: taking care of that aspect of it because
7044.88s: we want real data this isn't to support
7048.84s: the idea that uh being psychic is real
7052.60s: this is once we have the data then we
7055.48s: can jump to that conclusion yeah yeah
7058.64s: yeah and that's and you know there's
7060.56s: another thing that I've I've come across
7062.48s: when I've had conversations and that is
7065.40s: um well why would you want to I mean
7067.28s: what does it matter if I could see
7068.48s: through walls and stuff it's like well
7070.24s: what does it matter if you can jog a
7071.80s: mile or not you know it's like why do we
7074.36s: have to justify trying to fully embody
7078.00s: who we really are as these
7080.48s: multi-dimensional beings I don't have to
7082.36s: justify that I'm just trying to help you
7086.04s: get stronger and grow in your own
7088.32s: personal life because if we have more
7090.56s: people looking on the inside and this is
7092.92s: that part has been not only talked about
7095.24s: by sages all across the world and
7097.20s: different religions and backgrounds that
7099.40s: when you look inside and really do the
7101.76s: inter internal work you are better not
7105.04s: just you but the people everybody around
7107.32s: you gets benefit from that so we're
7110.28s: motivating people through this very fun
7112.96s: and you know Community
7115.28s: environment and getting them to go home
7118.36s: and and practice and the way we practice
7121.64s: is not by doing physical things in the
7124.08s: outside world the way we practice is by
7126.36s: working on our inner self and so year
7129.52s: after year a seven or eight or
7132.12s: 9-year-old and we have an adult division
7134.12s: too so it's not just for kids it's for
7135.96s: adults as well they're going home and
7138.64s: they're working on how to get better at
7140.56s: remote viewing and the way you get
7141.96s: better at that is dive deeper into
7144.32s: yourself more meditation yeah
7146.88s: self-reflection and I mean that's it's
7149.16s: just so cool it's just so so cool
7151.84s: because you know coming up growing up I
7154.52s: was like I want to be an
7156.76s: Xmen just putting that out there I said
7159.28s: I wanted to be a ninja at nine yeah dude
7161.36s: I mean it was like I want to be a spy or
7164.64s: a superhero or or or a ninja or a
7167.92s: magician anything with like some hidden
7169.48s: identity with like cool superpowers like
7171.72s: that was or gadgets right that's what we
7173.84s: wanted and I never really grew out of
7176.20s: that I don't think you did either um so
7179.04s: for me you know to hear about this stuff
7180.76s: this is like Xavier's School of like you
7183.56s: know what I mean this is kind of cool
7185.08s: this is like I get to see that in my
7186.96s: lifetime yeah I mean that is way way
7190.32s: cool and to be able to do that in a way
7194.12s: that's fun yes encouraging uh there's
7198.48s: levity it's hey let's cheer this person
7201.84s: on who's doing this event or oh did you
7204.16s: see so and so score with this and that I
7205.92s: mean it's just such a cool concept yeah
7208.20s: to be able to do there's no it's not in
7210.20s: a in a boring weird lab you know what I
7213.32s: mean and it's not in a place where
7214.84s: people are going to scrutinize you it's
7216.60s: in a place where people are going to
7217.56s: encourage you to try and who knows maybe
7220.08s: that encouragement will even yield
7221.48s: better result
7224.80s: well it's research out that says that
7226.36s: when you do things in play and fun that
7228.20s: you have better results and there's
7229.80s: there's a scientist who actually was
7231.52s: doing psychic research who said well
7234.96s: let's just do this from a fun
7236.64s: perspective and have people have a good
7239.12s: time and do it and he found that the
7241.72s: results were stronger let's go in that
7244.04s: environment than if it was like hey uh
7246.72s: make sure you know you do it this way
7248.52s: and this kind of like you said vacuum
7250.64s: and people were still getting decent
7253.44s: results but not as high as when it was
7255.44s: from this front perspective and that's
7257.56s: really where we are and I had a I had an
7259.96s: individual approached me once I was
7261.72s: asking him his advice on this because he
7263.56s: had walked this path uh with some
7265.88s: research and he was like you know uh
7268.00s: this country did that with the kids and
7270.08s: this country did that with the kids and
7272.04s: they were trying to do that and they
7273.36s: found that the kids just lose it after a
7275.60s: while and this that and other and I said
7277.72s: well first off let me be very clear this
7280.24s: is not a military program
7282.68s: this is not about what we can do for our
7285.48s: government this and when you're
7287.44s: approaching it from that that that if we
7289.60s: truly believe energy and intention
7292.72s: really can drive how we and we do it
7295.72s: with money people say oh you want to
7297.88s: manifest more money in your life you
7299.52s: have to have that intention if you want
7301.04s: to be a better lawyer you have to have
7302.68s: that intention the intention you put
7304.96s: around things really help influences
7307.84s: those things so if this is like this
7311.48s: thing this government thing you might
7313.64s: have different experience than if this
7316.28s: is a loving fun joyful thing and if we
7320.28s: put the proper intention we will
7322.24s: probably see that if we're talking about
7325.04s: heart coherence like the heart math
7326.84s: Institute they're finding that heart
7329.36s: coherence and coming from the heart is
7332.00s: actually allowing people to have great
7334.32s: great Better Lives it's influencing
7336.64s: their health it's influencing all these
7338.64s: things that ties back to a bunch of
7340.20s: sages that said the same thing and
7341.92s: photos we see with with uh prophets and
7344.76s: sages and special people with hearts and
7347.84s: Halos glowing you know this light so if
7351.76s: we truly believe that then that's the
7354.00s: that's how we advance is we
7356.68s: surround things where people can get
7359.08s: together and explore these with that
7360.64s: type of love yes with that type of
7362.80s: growth and or with that type of love and
7364.92s: have that type of growth and that's what
7367.28s: I don't that has not been done not in
7369.64s: this capacity maybe in a small uh
7372.44s: organization where we get 20 people at a
7374.28s: time taking a class and they all work on
7376.24s: that but I'm saying hey all you
7378.36s: organizations come together Under One
7380.68s: Roof let's get some researchers in here
7383.80s: who have been doing research let's get
7385.84s: people who can do in here who've been
7388.28s: doing let's get people who are in
7390.04s: between both of those they do and they
7391.92s: do research and let's just have us all
7394.16s: have this great event where we can talk
7396.44s: and communicate and learn and mentor and
7398.80s: grow and and start different
7400.88s: conversations because if I feel like you
7402.92s: can do um if I'm a researcher and I've
7405.56s: never met you or I'm very know I just
7407.44s: need you for the research that's a
7409.40s: horrible conversation for some for a lot
7411.48s: of people like hey I heard you can do
7413.40s: this thing yeah yeah I need you to come
7415.72s: to the lab so I can test you versus Man
7419.40s: Chris you did amazing and I really want
7422.28s: to get more data on this so that I can
7425.40s: talk about like how it's done and things
7427.32s: that would you help me you know and then

7438.48s: friendship and then we go into the lab
7440.44s: and we do the work yeah and now because
7442.24s: we have a friendship all of that other
7444.76s: stuff hopefully disappears and now we
7447.36s: can really focus on you know how what
7450.24s: what can be done and how it can be done
7452.64s: versus I'm not really sure about this
7455.20s: thing for me yeah but I heard you can do
7457.84s: it so come to my lab and let's see if

7471.24s: money here which is nice too there are
7472.88s: some prizes incentive is always fun uh

7527.96s: all right it's kind of like a game show
7530.68s: okay
7532.28s: um there's a there's a lot of really
7534.72s: good questions I've got like five I
7536.56s: don't know if we'll have time to get
7537.68s: through all maybe because we're going to
7538.52s: do a patreon episode after or I keep
7540.52s: saying patreon an intern extra episode
7543.36s: after and you guys can come watch that
7545.60s: maybe we'll answer some more there but
7547.36s: here's the first one
7551.40s: [Applause]
7556.24s: how do you prepare your remote viewing
7558.68s: sessions uh meditation
7561.60s: hemisync what do you do it's from black
7564.48s: Works 1301 I think that's a beautiful
7567.04s: question and I I can't I it's either
7569.68s: Bill Ray or Ingo Swan said you should be
7571.84s: able to remote view in a foxhole right
7574.40s: um and this idea that it doesn't matter
7577.48s: where you are what you're doing the goal
7579.20s: is to try to get to a point where can
7581.88s: remote view um in not ideal conditions
7586.64s: do you say I need to prepare my eyes so
7589.12s: I can go out and see every day or do you
7591.28s: just open your eyes and go for it you
7593.04s: know now there are things to do to
7594.64s: strengthen the eye muscles right so
7596.56s: maybe you can you know acquire things
7598.48s: faster if you're shooting or something
7600.04s: like that but ultimately you know how do
7602.80s: you make how do you normalize it so I
7605.40s: will if I do remote viewing and I do my
7608.28s: cool down they call it you know it'll be
7610.56s: some meditation and maybe a little bit
7612.44s: of breath work some longana breath work
7614.88s: or even some Mana to kind of get me in a
7617.52s: balanced state right
7619.92s: so let me explain that so for those who
7622.56s: know yoga there are three different you
7625.84s: know uh energies that you can move to
7628.88s: with breath work and stuff and there's
7630.80s: Lana which is like a very relax or a
7633.36s: relaxing State and there's s Mana which
7635.80s: is very balanced and you know and then
7638.92s: there's brah which is very energized or
7641.64s: energetic and you're you can affect
7643.36s: those energies based on how you breathe
7645.92s: and so and and then what your focus and
7647.96s: intent of your practi is and so I would
7650.52s: do like maybe calm myself with some
7652.92s: longana or I'd go into a very balanced
7655.44s: state with s Mana um and then I would go
7658.40s: into my remote viewing but lately like I
7660.68s: said since I had that experience where
7663.68s: oh man I just got to get this homework
7665.40s: in you know like I just get out of the
7667.32s: way like let me just sit down and do it
7669.88s: you know that has been um something that
7673.12s: I've had a lot of success with and also
7676.16s: it but it takes me not being tied to the
7678.44s: outcome right you know so if I'm in if
7681.24s: I'm going in with the outcome that I
7682.76s: want to be successful and everything has
7684.56s: to be perfect then then that could
7687.08s: actually or my experience could hinder
7689.72s: my ability to do well but if I just say
7692.80s: hey hands up let's play you know let's
7696.64s: go let's do this Bo boom boom boom
7698.68s: that's when the KN experiment basically
7700.92s: yeah yeah knowing happens the most when
7702.84s: I'm free to allow to things to come to
7706.80s: me the way I know they have before and
7709.68s: if they don't okay that's cool but I'm
7711.52s: not going to be down on myself because
7713.08s: of it great answer and not the answer I
7715.36s: expected which is great no yeah I was
7717.64s: like oh for sure he's going to go into
7718.84s: like Focus 12 or something good I like
7721.56s: that
7722.28s: answer um okay flippity flip asking the
7727.20s: real questions here okay flippity flip
7729.40s: let's F get ready for this one this a
7732.28s: great question that's all these colors
7734.60s: up
7736.68s: there what are ways to protect yourself
7739.88s: from scop or to detect them good that's
7743.16s: a great question so the thing that we
7744.84s: talked about earlier was to one first
7748.48s: you know I love this question
7750.80s: um uh from Usual Suspects if you ever
7753.56s: watch that the greatest movie The
7755.00s: Greatest trick the devil ever pulled was
7756.76s: making the world believe he didn't exist
7758.64s: right and so you you as an individual
7763.00s: pull the wool over your own eyes to
7764.64s: start with and that is by saying I know
7767.68s: everything or I know what I you know um
7770.72s: I my facts and the way I see the world
7772.84s: is the way it is versus saying the way I
7775.28s: see the world could still be a little
7777.40s: off you know and the way I'm viewing
7779.88s: this because it's filtered through the
7781.56s: way I see the world and my brain does
7783.08s: all these things to kind of make
7784.36s: movement through life easier where it
7786.56s: has all these patterns and things and I
7789.60s: could be moving through attentional
7791.40s: blindness or an attentional blindness
7793.52s: and you know so I have to be first aware
7797.56s: that I have those hooks you know and
7800.36s: that I could be hooked by em motion or
7803.16s: something like that so I have to step
7804.76s: back and say oh is this my hook talking
7806.76s: or so recognize your own hooks recognize
7808.72s: your own hooks that's that's the first
7811.12s: and then the other is I have to cut out
7813.40s: the middle person the middle media right
7816.16s: what is if that a newspaper my blog or
7819.12s: Vlog or Twitter or whatever I have to
7821.04s: get to you and have the conversation and
7823.92s: say well what is it that you're thinking
7825.88s: versus me going through this process of
7828.32s: saying well this piece of information
7830.60s: has to be true because of what because
7832.52s: we really don't know right you could go
7834.84s: to a person that you think resonates
7837.08s: with you and that they seem like they
7839.56s: give good information and then find out
7841.92s: down the line that that person's getting
7843.76s: like $10 million a year from some
7846.92s: Corporation through a shell company you
7849.32s: know like and then you're like oh no
7851.44s: usaid yeah basically right to help
7854.96s: influence you know in this way because
7858.56s: and maybe they're not as um aware or or
7862.92s: or focused on who they're dealing with
7865.36s: as you thought they were you know um so
7868.40s: those two things I think are really
7870.12s: powerful okay and the other is whenever
7873.00s: you're watching something and you start
7875.64s: feeling an emotion or uh you start
7880.32s: landing on something something pause and
7883.16s: that's when you need to really think
7884.80s: about it so if something is influencing
7886.92s: you're watching a news broadcast and
7889.16s: it's making you angry that's for that's
7891.60s: a time for you to pause and step back
7893.76s: and say whoa or making you like super
7896.88s: empathetic or sympathetic oh man I feel
7899.88s: so bad for that person you know like
7901.48s: maybe you should so so yeah they're
7902.80s: really playing off that cancer or
7904.28s: whatever like you know like they'll
7905.52s: they'll hit you in the heartstring
7906.92s: sometimes you're like wait there was a
7908.80s: there's actually it's funny you say that
7910.04s: there was um the the Super Bowl I was
7912.84s: looking at some of the ads fizer um they
7916.44s: had like a really great ad um you know
7919.84s: regardless of how you feel about uh
7921.84s: Pharm giant pharmaceutical you know
7924.12s: conglomerate um but they had like yeah
7926.44s: it was like all about this kid who was
7927.72s: like fighting cancer and like he was
7929.64s: like like a boxer and he was like run he
7932.44s: was cancer-free and the nurses were
7933.84s: crying and like he got back to his
7935.28s: family his hug it's like s and then at
7936.88s: the end she like fizer and I'm
7939.32s: like I'm like you can't be mad at that
7942.92s: right I'm in favor of this kid not
7944.92s: having
7946.00s: cancer even though maybe I don't like
7948.16s: fizer yeah you know what I mean so they
7950.04s: play on your emotions like that because
7952.56s: at the end of the day you know maybe
7954.80s: we're not talking about that maybe we're
7956.16s: talking about something else so you know
7958.04s: it's it's it's good to recognize it's a
7959.84s: good point like if you're feeling
7961.12s: emotional like if you're that means
7963.20s: they've got you by the hooks they've got
7965.04s: you yeah I was watching a a commercial
7967.12s: cuz this is that time where you're
7968.28s: looking for donations right so was for
7970.80s: like pet you know place that that helps
7973.88s: rescue pets and the lady comes on there
7976.24s: and she's like and there's all these
7978.48s: pets and they're all sad and they're
7979.88s: chained up and they're this and she's
7981.52s: like instead of just saying hey these
7983.56s: pets need your help she's like these
7985.88s: pets need your help and I was like and
7988.96s: she's like like she's crying on the
7990.64s: other end of this thing right and I'm
7992.56s: just like oh my gosh and it's got the
7994.76s: little dog and he looks so sad and he's
7997.08s: and you you know producers like give us
7999.12s: another one but like more sad please
8000.88s: this time
8002.28s: okay less sad than exactly so if you're
8004.44s: watching that and you have an attachment
8006.04s: to dogs and and you and you hear this
8010.04s: lady's voice that sadness that they're
8014.12s: relaying to you through her voice that
8017.08s: there's there's this compounding what we
8019.20s: call SA act I don't know if we got into
8021.20s: it but there's scop which tends to be
8023.96s: more long-term which you would do to
8025.84s: influence and then there's the actions
8028.08s: that are being done so Saks that are
8030.64s: being done to create the scop I see does
8033.84s: that make sense yeah yeah the individual
8035.24s: components components yeah so the small
8037.24s: things that you do to help you every
8039.36s: like an advertisement that advertisement
8041.52s: would be a s act for the long-term goal
8044.08s: of getting people to donate to that huh
8048.16s: in Magic we call it
8049.80s: subtleties so if um you know if I was to
8054.52s: say like hey check this out I'm going to
8057.40s: I'm going to make this disappear and I
8058.88s: go like this and it's gone you know
8060.72s: eventually figure out that I just threw
8062.16s: it on my lap type deal yeah but um you
8065.44s: know the subtlety uh to make it better
8068.28s: would be this would already had to be on
8070.28s: the table it's weird that I put it down
8072.84s: first and then took it picked it up
8074.52s: again that's insane only insane person
8076.36s: would do something like that so why is
8078.32s: it on the table Yeah that's what we got
8080.32s: to think about as a magician why is it
8081.76s: on the table maybe I did this and I was
8083.16s: writing over here and now I'm thinking
8085.80s: about something and I'm like you know
8086.88s: what check this out and now I do it
8088.28s: right now now there's a little bit of a
8089.48s: justification we call those subtleties
8091.28s: yeah there's actually something called
8092.76s: the Ramy subtlety I didn't invent this
8094.52s: it was John Ramsey is a a coin magician
8098.16s: um but like if you're if you're palming
8100.08s: something um to be able to hold
8102.72s: something this is a Ramy subtlety even
8104.52s: though I have this in Palm I want to
8106.48s: hide it so I'm going to hold something
8108.12s: or I'm going to gesture uh like this and
8110.56s: this is a subtlety so these little
8112.24s: things that really like create that
8113.48s: illusion yeah yeah it's funny that you
8115.96s: should say that because you know again
8118.44s: that's and then scop that's setting the
8120.32s: stage right
8121.68s: um but you know these these little
8124.44s: subtle things that you do to kind of get
8126.68s: the mind to adjust to what you're trying
8128.96s: to do over time is is very important and
8132.04s: there's a book out that there one of the
8134.48s: books that we got was called influence
8136.60s: by Robert cini I believe his name is and
8139.60s: um that was like a Bible right and
8141.88s: looking reading that book reading that
8143.44s: book I have that book and then he came
8145.04s: out with a new book called persuasion
8147.20s: where he he did a lot of research and
8149.48s: and put a lot of research in thing where
8152.00s: it talks about setting up the the
8155.28s: persuasion all right um with persuasion
8160.12s: right or actually I think it's
8161.48s: persuasion was that book there's another
8163.00s: book called influence and then this so
8166.00s: persuasion or the things you do to set
8168.52s: up the persuasion you you so put the the
8173.64s: the cap on the table beforehand you know
8177.00s: and then come to it and then make it
8179.08s: disappear versus taking the C cap off
8181.68s: drawing my attention to it then making
8183.80s: it disappear you know it's like that why
8186.40s: which also is a thing we have in a
8188.24s: friend of mine who is uh special forces
8191.12s: would you know brought that up to me one
8192.84s: day and we were talking about some
8194.68s: overlaping the things we did and he said
8196.60s: you know whatever I go to an area and I
8199.32s: see somebody just one of the ways you
8201.12s: can spot somebody who might be a tailing
8203.80s: you or something like that is to ask
8205.80s: yourself why is that person there right
8208.24s: so if you see somebody standing on the
8209.68s: corner or you got five people out here
8211.96s: standing on the corner immediately in
8213.92s: your mind go to why everybody is there
8216.56s: so they nobody just stands on the corner
8220.16s: normally so if I see this person why are
8223.20s: they oh they're they're about to get the
8224.80s: trash oh he's waiting for his girlfriend
8226.88s: to come out of the house oh that guy's
8228.32s: about to smoke a cigarette oh this
8230.32s: person you know so your brain will go
8232.28s: through the wise and the minute the
8233.64s: brain says oh there's a why that isn't
8236.28s: being fulfilled that's the red flag and
8238.88s: so then of course spies learn how to
8241.20s: good wise right why would I be here you
8243.52s: know it's exactly like a magic trick I'm
8245.92s: telling you we think about this stuff
8247.44s: like more than anybody knows like it's
8249.08s: it's really you're getting into the
8250.52s: really like the when you jam with
8252.48s: magicians I I go on a retreat every year
8254.60s: with some of the best magicians in the
8255.76s: world for like a week in Spain we rent
8257.32s: the house every year and we just go
8258.88s: through like this stuff we just talk
8260.44s: shop and you know the justifications and
8263.12s: the subtleties and the wise are very
8264.76s: very important um it's the difference
8267.16s: between a good trick and a great
8269.00s: illusion like I mean if you have
8270.32s: somebody doing something and every
8272.28s: single move that they do is Justified
8276.32s: then there's no red flags popping off in
8278.52s: your head subconsciously yeah and it
8280.84s: helps strengthen the magic because if
8282.84s: I'm here and you know and I'm standing
8285.60s: and I'm like this you know you're like
8287.64s: why is his hand like that yeah why right
8290.60s: so my hand has to be natural yeah okay
8292.92s: so my hand's natural but why is my hand
8294.56s: out here at all my hand should be down
8296.20s: here yeah my hand should I shouldn't be
8298.08s: doing that you know and and so there's
8299.80s: all these we to the wise all the time
8301.88s: why are you doing that why' you why' you
8303.56s: just do that little move why' you pivot
8305.36s: that way yeah why did you and so very
8308.36s: very cool yeah
8310.40s: again keep them
8312.68s: coming all right we got um oh this is
8316.52s: good uh not quite human so he's uh he's
8318.80s: on our you know he's part of our Discord
8321.88s: and he actually does weekly remote
8324.36s: viewing sessions for the interns so if
8327.36s: you're ever interested in remote viewing
8329.00s: and you're an intern you can hit not
8331.12s: quite human up and he's he's learning he
8334.80s: knows nothing about it he's a tasker and
8337.68s: so he's got a lot of questions if ever
8339.84s: by the way if you ever have time to hop
8341.84s: on our Discord okay for like a Q&A I
8344.20s: know this guy would be very thankful
8345.64s: he'd have a million questions for you
8347.48s: let's do it that up here's his question
8350.04s: it's a pretty good question he had like
8351.44s: four questions he was so
8359.16s: excited what are your t tis for remote
8362.24s: viewing
8363.32s: taskers oh that's an interesting one cuz
8365.72s: I'm not I'm not a tasker per se do do
8368.20s: you know any like any tips that you
8370.16s: might be able to give him um if you're
8372.96s: tasking um make sure that you are so one
8377.16s: of the things they figured out and this
8379.40s: this again is my perspective but one of
8381.44s: the things they figured out in the past
8382.92s: that if you don't give specific times
8387.20s: you know like if you don't say hey we
8390.24s: need
8391.28s: uh for your monitor to give you this
8394.32s: number but we want to task it for this
8396.48s: specific timeline than just like Joe MCM
8399.28s: monacle that who you interviewed you can
8401.88s: end up a thousand years in the future or
8404.36s: a thousand years in the past and if I'm
8406.52s: not looking at that timeline then I
8409.52s: could be incor I I can be giving you
8411.88s: information that is correct but it's at
8413.60s: the wrong time does that make sense so
8416.20s: for you you're like it's wrong but it
8418.28s: actually is right but it's just at a
8419.84s: different time because
8421.32s: sometimes the remote viewers mind will
8423.04s: jump at the most interesting thing that
8425.04s: happened in that place right the most
8427.12s: entropy or the most like so if you're if
8430.08s: but if you want to know what's happening
8432.04s: there now then you should say when to
8435.04s: the monitor hey when you give this
8437.16s: information make sure that you ask like
8439.76s: what's happening there right now or
8442.20s: what's going to be happening what
8443.68s: happened on the moon a million years ago
8446.76s: but you don't say the moon obviously but
8448.64s: you're you're saying here's the coord
8451.16s: or whatever 7 five six blah blah blah
8454.80s: and you know tell me what happened there
8458.28s: at that coordinate a million years ago
8460.80s: you know and then the task I mean then
8463.08s: the remote viewer will be like oh okay
8465.36s: got it let me go and then but you know
8467.80s: so that would be one aspect of it is
8470.08s: that when you're tasking um that person
8472.84s: the other thing that I would say too is
8475.04s: know who your remote viewers are and
8476.56s: what they're good at so some remote
8478.12s: viewers are good at giving you colors
8480.16s: and shap
8481.68s: and some remote viewers are good at
8483.40s: giving you like really quality like
8485.36s: drawings and idiograms like me all my
8488.12s: drawings look like chck chicken scratch
8489.92s: you know so I'm not the guy you need
8491.76s: sketches from you know like like I'll
8494.24s: you need you need to get somebody to
8496.16s: discern just the sketches so it's a
8498.36s: whole another step if you want that um
8501.04s: but I'm the guy that you know you might
8503.08s: get some good descriptors from you know
8505.52s: and so um or I can give you I can do
8508.24s: really I do really well on colors but I
8510.28s: don't do good on shapes you know and so
8512.88s: know who you're dealing with just like
8514.36s: you would in any other type of uh you
8517.52s: know uh operational environment um even
8520.44s: in scop you know some people were really
8522.76s: good at coming up with uh radio ads or
8526.12s: things that should be on the radio some
8527.80s: people were more visual so they were
8529.40s: better at coming up with things that
8530.84s: might be on the television you know so
8533.72s: um and then you should be tasked based
8535.84s: on your strength not your weakness okay
8538.56s: great great answers than I'm sure he'll
8541.24s: appreciate that and I'm sure uh I mean
8543.88s: any anything he seems very passionate
8545.32s: about this remov viewing stuff which is
8546.64s: really cool to see um all right we have
8549.28s: Tess
8551.00s: here this is a great question I like
8553.48s: this question a lot and after that we'll
8554.84s: hop into the
8560.20s: extra Tess asks what is the most unusual
8563.84s: SLS
8564.88s: surprising uh way you have utilized your
8568.96s: expertise oh my God go I don't know
8571.24s: that's a great
8572.72s: question cuz I don't I don't have a
8575.24s: timeline she was supposed to give me a
8577.60s: time um at what point which one stands
8585.16s: out so I I
8588.00s: think and it I guess it depends on if
8590.56s: it's my expertise as a Ninjutsu
8592.72s: practitioner or as or or a survival we
8596.24s: need get into survival experience yeah
8599.04s: yeah I think those those things are so
8602.00s: many different rounds so let's pick one
8604.44s: yeah let's pick
8606.80s: um you know what let's go for
8609.16s: survival because most people you know we
8611.20s: didn't talk about that at all but you're
8612.64s: like a survival expert uh you were on
8614.96s: Naked and Afraid uh which is an insane
8618.16s: concept for a show by the way they just
8620.00s: drop you off naked somewhere and they're
8621.40s: like good luck I was on first man out
8624.28s: and CH and a Tibetan plateau in China
8626.80s: and uh raced to survive Alaska I was in
8629.48s: the wilderness in Wilds of Alaska so
8631.96s: yeah it's been quite a bit of things
8634.16s: okay so bearing that in mind I think
8636.80s: that's a great and I have an answer okay
8638.68s: now that you say it so when it comes to
8640.80s: survival one of the ways that I tend to
8643.12s: look at things a little more uniquely is
8645.00s: I use the ninja Elemental structure and
8649.00s: that helps me work within nature with
8652.20s: nature and not against nature so I
8655.12s: remember watching a show Once I'm not
8657.36s: going to say what but I remember
8658.64s: watching a person and they were like I'm
8660.40s: Make nature my [ __ ] you know like
8662.44s: they're like all like into it and and um
8665.56s: and for me that's not it so the ninja
8668.16s: were Masters at being able to fit
8672.40s: in right our power as modern day ninja
8676.28s: but at power as past ninja was not to
8680.16s: force my will onto you but how do I
8682.84s: allow you to create your own destruction
8685.84s: and and and that's really challenging
8687.92s: for people cuz we like to resist and do
8690.04s: stuff right so now you're telling me no
8692.60s: I'm letting you do stuff and that in
8696.12s: doing that it creates the openings for
8698.28s: me to win right right just like probably
8702.28s: you know with magic you're finding out
8704.64s: where they opening is that Gap so you
8707.88s: can get in there and the Beats yeah and
8711.04s: so when I'm in the wild using this ninja
8714.88s: mentality of the elements means that I
8718.88s: understand how they the elements
8720.68s: interplay with each other so and I use
8723.68s: that also I used that for scop too and
8725.64s: that was not taught to me at the
8726.76s: schoolhouse this was taught to me by
8728.52s: ninjitsu and that made me unique again
8731.56s: was is that we we say that Earth
8735.08s: interacts the the way Earth interplays
8737.96s: with let's say water so if I have if I
8741.00s: have a water mentality let me let me
8743.48s: take it from the human into the nature
8745.60s: if I have a water mentality a person who
8748.72s: is scientific who likes to think through
8750.88s: things who's very reflective so on and
8753.32s: so forth and I want to control that then
8756.24s: I would look at how Earth controls water
8758.40s: in nature oh well you can have trough
8762.28s: you can have a water way or a stream and
8765.36s: so you form the dam you form these
8768.24s: things to help you guide the water whoa
8770.96s: right that's awesome so then if I want
8773.68s: to get a a water mindset person then I
8777.64s: have to find solid means of helping
8781.88s: guide them and because they're
8783.60s: scientific and they like to analyze I
8786.12s: have to set up things for their
8788.48s: analyzation their analytical mind to
8791.76s: then want to move in that direction
8795.00s: right um now let's say you vice versa
8798.32s: Earth super strong stagnant I'm there
8801.84s: right well how does water deal with
8803.76s: Earth well it erodes it over time so now
8808.08s: I have to use my analytical mind to wear
8810.80s: it down wear it down how do I wear this
8813.28s: down and so if it's a relationship maybe
8815.36s: I don't want to wear down my partner but
8817.40s: maybe I keep making these suggestions
8820.24s: and showing that partner like how it
8822.44s: would be better if we did it this way
8824.68s: because of this and it actually weakens
8827.32s: with that water too yeah yeah exactly oh
8830.16s: dude this is so cool right so then I
8833.00s: love this so then when I'm in nature and
8834.80s: I say oh man I see the sky it's about
8837.64s: the rain on me and it's going to be
8839.68s: super cold tonight and it's going to do
8841.56s: all this stuff okay I have two means of
8844.92s: dealing with this well I would use fire
8848.56s: but if it's going to rain the rain might
8850.76s: put out the fire so I need a barrier so
8855.56s: against the water so I'm going to make a
8857.44s: shelter you get what I'm saying and the
8860.20s: shelter is going to be able to keep the
8861.72s: water out but I need to keep my heat in
8866.04s: so I'm going to make insulation so I'm
8867.80s: going to use Earth to help me keep the
8869.52s: heat in as though I would a fire ring
8871.88s: around a fire pit or a or like we would
8875.48s: make a chimney to reflect the heat back
8877.56s: into the thing so I need to keep that
8879.40s: contained so how do I do that oh I'm
8881.08s: going to put insulation in here by
8882.92s: putting debris on it and I'm going to
8884.68s: use Earth that way so when I see how the
8887.32s: elements interact and how they can stop
8889.72s: or progress or move one another then I
8893.88s: can now start thinking scientifically
8896.36s: about what I need in that particular way
8898.64s: and interplaying with the envir
8900.12s: enironment as the environment knows how
8901.92s: to interplay with itself so good dude
8905.24s: that's so good it's so much food for
8906.96s: thought for me like CU you know
8908.96s: especially when you're like oh water
8910.28s: person that's their type and then you
8911.96s: can use the other elements depend I'm
8913.96s: like oh my God this is so practical yeah
8916.92s: so practical I'm going to add one thing
8918.76s: to that I think you'll like it um so
8921.40s: then we see normally we'll have the
8923.96s: elements signed up in a row right and so
8926.32s: it's linear but it really isn't it's
8928.24s: it's not even circular it's more
8931.20s: spherical right so the elements and how
8933.40s: they play are moving around each other
8935.80s: in the sphere like thing and they
8937.88s: transition into one another so water
8941.56s: transitions into fire in order for water
8944.48s: to be effective in this interplay and so
8947.80s: when we look at it from personality wise
8949.80s: we say well water is
8953.40s: scientific
8955.20s: analytical but as we were saying earlier
8957.88s: what's information and Science and
8959.36s: Analytics without action mhm and fire is
8963.20s: action so I transitioned from this stage
8967.44s: of fluidity and looking at things from
8970.40s: different angles to okay now it's time
8972.60s: to make something happen and bring it
8974.08s: out in the world okay what is what do I
8975.80s: need for that or I need fire and then I
8978.76s: say oh okay well now I have this
8983.52s: action but I only have but so much
8985.76s: energy and I'm I'm losing that I need I
8988.00s: need more I need I need more more than
8990.44s: just my mind so then I call in Wind
8993.00s: which is going to help feed this flame
8995.48s: right I but if I call Ino much wind with
8999.64s: no fuel it'll burn me out so I need to
9002.44s: get some Earth people in here who like
9004.32s: stability to help me have a good
9006.20s: foundation while I continue to move with
9009.48s: passion to bring this thing into
9011.48s: existence and use the win people to help
9013.40s: feed me to Help Me Grow that to the next
9015.40s: level beautiful and so there's this
9017.68s: interplay between them and we all have
9020.40s: one or two elements that we kind of live
9022.36s: in and then we Branch out into the other
9025.08s: ones as we have engagements and as we
9028.56s: have to we find new new ways because you
9031.68s: know I'm normally a wi person but I have
9035.04s: been an earth I have had to operate from
9037.32s: Earth because I need stability at times
9040.00s: you know I need to know that my business
9042.04s: is going to be open tomorrow and things
9043.64s: need to happen and so that means I just
9045.44s: can't always be out in the world doing
9047.32s: what I want and creating I have to have
9049.08s: some solidity
9050.56s: so those that interplay helps me look at
9054.72s: everything you know I look at in
9057.08s: relationships with people but I also
9059.20s: look at my relationship with the world
9061.36s: in that same way and so that from a you
9064.64s: know from my expertise that is one of
9067.40s: the most unique ways that I found to be
9069.52s: able to be successful in the wilderness
9071.84s: is not by trying to force my humanism on
9076.36s: nature but recognize the nature within
9079.00s: my nature right wow beautifully said
9081.88s: that is amazing um I think we're going
9084.16s: to end that there I think there's a
9085.68s: better way to end that that's so poetic
9088.36s: uh hakeim Isler man you are such an
