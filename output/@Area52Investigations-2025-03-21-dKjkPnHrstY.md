2.08s: Hi, Chris. My name is Rob. I'm in
4.24s: Northern California. Back in 2012, my
8.16s: work partner and I were working on a 911
11.12s: ambulance and uh working night shift
13.60s: together when we uh both saw a giant
16.72s: flying V, partially cloaked, uh about
19.68s: 10,000 ft in the air above our heads,
22.56s: completely silent. uh had five running
25.52s: lights in the center of the V, you know,
28.32s: two on each wing, one directly in the
30.08s: center towards the tip. Uh it uh like I
33.12s: said, very very large in size and it was
36.48s: completely silent. It was on the early
38.88s: morning hours. And after doing some
40.96s: research on such a craft, I later found
44.08s: out that this was the same craft
46.00s: reported by thousands in Phoenix back in
49.28s: 1997.
51.20s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
52.64s: another episode of Debriefed. My name is
54.72s: Chris Ramsay, and today we're going to
57.52s: be going through part three of the Lerta
59.84s: Files. Now, these are two different
61.84s: interviews that happened in Sweden by a
64.24s: man who remains anonymous and a female
67.12s: reptilian by the name of Lerta. We've
69.28s: read through the first part, and we did
71.20s: that in two parts, and now is the second
73.28s: part. So, technically part three. You
75.68s: guys figure out the math. I'm just here
77.20s: to go through the documents. Things
78.88s: we've learned thus far from Lerta
81.64s: include her anatomy, how babies are
84.80s: born. We learned about this interstellar
88.24s: war for Earth. We learned about our
90.40s: genetic manipulation when they stole
92.72s: Simeians for thousands of years and came
94.72s: back and and we popped up and the
97.20s: reptilians went underground. I mean,
99.20s: there's a whole lore to this. This is it
102.24s: gets crazier and crazier the more you
104.40s: read through it. Also, we're here to see
106.48s: if we can match any of the information
108.40s: up with stuff that is currently being
110.96s: talked about. You know, we might find
113.04s: something, we might not find something.
115.28s: The point is we're going to enjoy the
117.12s: ride. And so, I would highly suggest to
119.60s: suspend your disbelief, check it at the
121.92s: door, because often belief, as you know,
123.92s: uh, just gets in the way of a good
125.20s: story. Folks, like this video,
127.68s: subscribe, and hit the notification bell
129.68s: if you want to be notified. And head on
131.28s: over to Area52.shop shop if you want to
133.28s: check out some of the latest merch that
135.12s: we just dropped, including three brand
136.64s: new hats. We got the evidence bags,
138.48s: which are a crowd favorite. So many
140.48s: awesome things in this brand new website
142.16s: that we launched that I'm very excited
143.44s: about. And if you want to support the
144.56s: show, you can do that. Or you can head
145.92s: over to Patreon for some extra content.
147.68s: I just filmed a vlog. Uh I went to the
150.00s: Age of Disclosure premiere at South by
152.24s: Southwest in Austin. And if you want to
154.00s: hear my thoughts, that's there as well,
156.40s: along with a whole bunch of other perks.
158.64s: In this line of work, evidence is
160.64s: everything. every interview, every lead,
164.80s: it has to be crystal clear. And that's
167.44s: why I don't take any chances. I use
170.12s: Riverside. When I sat down with Chris
172.40s: Bledsoe to discuss his story or with Dr.
175.28s: Diane Powell to talk about the telepathy
177.28s: tapes, I needed a setup I could trust
180.24s: because these conversations, they
182.48s: matter. Riverside recorded every word in
185.28s: 4K video and pristine audio so I could
187.80s: focus on the truth. Forget the old ways.
191.60s: With Riverside, I get studio quality
193.76s: recordings from anywhere. Multitrack
196.24s: recording separates my voice from my
197.92s: guests. So, editing is easy. No
201.12s: complicated setups. Just hit record and
204.72s: it's done. If you're a creator, an
206.96s: investigator, a podcaster, or just
208.80s: someone who needs top tier recordings,
210.72s: Riverside is the real deal. Try it for
213.28s: free. The link is in the description.
215.20s: And if you upgrade, use code area52 for
218.40s: 20% off a yearly plan. Trust me, you'll
221.60s: want this in your toolkit.
223.48s: Folks, we paid the bills. Let's get into
226.48s: reading about the
229.16s: Lucertifiles. All right, where were we?
231.12s: So, we left off the last interview was
234.40s: allegedly in December of 1999, and then
238.40s: they met up a second time, which was in
240.80s: April of 2000. And this is that
244.24s: interview. Uh now, so there is a quite a
247.28s: lengthy introduction here before we get
250.88s: into the Q&A. And this introduction is
253.76s: by Ole K who's this anonymous gentleman
256.64s: from Sweden. So we're going to read
257.92s: through his introduction prior to
260.16s: getting into the Q&A.
262.04s: Introduction. I once again reaffirm that
264.88s: the following text is the absolute truth
267.84s: and is not fiction. It was composed from
270.80s: three original tape recordings which
272.48s: were made on April 24, 2000 with a tape
275.68s: recorder during my second interview with
278.08s: a reptilian creature known as Lerta. At
281.12s: Lerta's request, the original text of 31
283.76s: pages was shortened up to deal with some
286.00s: questions and answers. Some existing
287.84s: questions were partially shortened or
289.52s: amended. It was even undertaken to
291.36s: extract message and significance from
293.28s: it. This part of the interview, either
295.36s: not mentioned or not mentioned
296.96s: completely in the transcript, deals
298.88s: primarily with personal issues,
301.60s: paranormal demonstrations, the social
303.76s: system of the reptilian species, and
307.20s: alien technology and physics. Folks,
310.40s: this is going to get really interesting,
312.16s: I think. Also note that this was
314.96s: translated, I believe, from Swedish, so
317.12s: there will be some grammatical
319.20s: corrections that would have to be made,
321.52s: but I'm going to read it sort of
323.60s: verbatim as is, as it was printed.
326.16s: Forgive me if you were just an audio
328.16s: listener, by the way. Um, you're going
331.44s: to have to just wade through, you know,
333.28s: some of these errors with me. The reason
335.60s: for the shifting of the date and time of
337.68s: the second meeting was a possible
339.60s: observation and surveillance of my own
341.80s: person after the publication of the
344.40s: first transcript. Although everything
346.96s: was attempted on the advice of Lerta to
349.44s: keep my identity a secret, just 2 days
352.64s: after the dissemination of the document
354.60s: abroad, various unusual events took
357.64s: place. Please don't think that I am
359.84s: paranoid. However, I believe that the
362.80s: publication of the interview has drawn
364.56s: either official attention or the
367.04s: attention of some organization to me. Up
370.16s: until this time, I usually regarded
372.48s: people who believed that they were being
374.56s: followed by the state to be nothing more
376.80s: than jokers. But now, I have begun to
379.60s: revise my ideas on that since events in
382.56s: January. It began with a failure of my
385.84s: telephone for several hours. When the
388.24s: phone became operational once again,
390.48s: there were quiet echoes and strange
392.32s: clicking and worring sounds when I made
394.76s: calls. A defect could ostensibly not be
398.32s: found anywhere. Overnight, important
401.44s: data disappeared from the hard drive in
403.52s: my computer. The testing program
405.68s: reported defective sectors were
408.16s: strangely enough. There were only data
410.96s: which dealt with illustrations and
412.72s: completed textual material from the
414.96s: interview. These defective sectors also
418.80s: contained material of a paranormal
420.72s: nature in the field of my research.
422.56s: Fortunately, the material was also
424.40s: stored on floppies. In addition, I
426.56s: discovered by pure chance some hidden
429.12s: data in a likewise hidden directory
431.36s: index. the name which appeared on the
433.68s: data and the directory index was
437.64s: E72UJ. Okay, so this guy's, you know,
441.52s: running into some what he thinks is
444.88s: probably interference on the
446.48s: government's behalf or just, you know,
448.24s: some other people trying to keep tabs on
451.20s: him. Interesting that he's like, I
452.64s: backed it up on a floppy. You know, 2000
455.12s: doesn't seem that far back, but I mean,
456.80s: we've come quite a long way in terms of
459.84s: technology. A friend who is a computer
461.76s: expert could not make anything of this
464.04s: designation. And when I was about to
466.00s: show it to him, the directory index had
469.00s: disappeared. One evening, my apartment
471.20s: door was standing wide open. My TV set
473.44s: was running. And I am absolutely
475.36s: confident that I had turned the TV set
477.64s: off. Okay. Says he's not paranoid.
480.96s: Sounds paranoid. Is it justified? Maybe.
484.56s: a minivan with British markings and the
486.72s: imprint of a Europewide supermarket
489.04s: chain parked in front of my house. I
491.36s: noticed the same minivan again on
494.08s: several occasions traveling at a
495.76s: distance behind my car, even when I
498.40s: visited the town of blank blank blank 65
502.96s: km away. When I returned, the car was on
506.08s: the other side of the street once again.
508.48s: I never saw anyone get into or out of
510.96s: the car. A knock on the door of the
513.12s: vehicle and on the tinted windows caused
515.52s: no reactions of any kind. After about 2
518.32s: weeks, the minivan disappeared again.
520.32s: When I informed EF, EF being the other
523.44s: person uh involved in this um
526.48s: dissemination of information uh
528.80s: personally about these events, he
530.08s: suggested that I change place and date
532.64s: of the meeting in order to assure our
534.80s: own and Lerta safety. The meeting took
536.96s: place on April 27th, 2000 in another
539.68s: isolated location. It was unobserved as
542.40s: far as I can determine. Once again, all
546.24s: of this may sound strange and paranoid
548.40s: like a fantasy from a cheap science
550.16s: fiction film. However, I can only repeat
553.28s: to and assure the reader once again, all
556.32s: of this is the unadulterated truth.
559.28s: Believe my words or don't believe them.
561.60s: These things have happened and they will
564.24s: continue to happen whether you believe
565.76s: it or not until it is too late. Our
569.80s: civilization is in
572.12s: danger. Ola K May 3rd, 2000. Wow. All
576.32s: right. This character
578.20s: here again assures us that this is true.
582.00s: Exactly what you would do if you, you
583.84s: know, were making something up. But
585.36s: we're going to believe it just for now
587.04s: and see what happens. This is the
588.72s: shortened version of the transcript of
590.80s: the interview dated April 27th, 2000.
594.80s: Here's a comment by Ol before we get
597.20s: started. The meeting began with an
599.36s: appraisal of diverse questions and
601.04s: opinions which I had gotten from the
602.80s: readers of the first transcript in
604.64s: anonymous fashion through distribution
606.56s: from my trustworthy friends. Some of
608.80s: these opinions altogether, there were
611.36s: over 14 pages of paper contained
613.76s: comments shaped by everything from a
616.00s: radically religious to a fanatical
618.56s: tendency to welcome contact with a
620.48s: reptilian species. Some of these
622.48s: comments contain stereotypical phrases
624.56s: like servants of hell or species of the
627.36s: evil one. I don't want to get into any
629.92s: kind of detailed description here since
631.68s: I don't want to pass on further any
633.84s: false and radical realm of thought.
636.80s: Okay, so he kind of ignored those
639.60s: questions I would assume. And here we
642.16s: go. Strap yourselves
643.72s: in. It's going to get
646.68s: weird. Question. When you read these
649.36s: religious and anonymously written
652.32s: comments here, what do you think and
655.12s: feel then? Is the relationship between
657.44s: your species and ours really shaped from
660.40s: that kind of total negation?
663.32s: Answer: Does it amaze you that I am not
665.84s: completely angered by that. I had fully
668.00s: expected those kinds of extreme
669.44s: reactions. The programming for the utter
672.00s: negation of another species, especially
674.40s: the reptilian species, as in your own
677.04s: case, is deeply embedded in each of your
679.52s: own individual
681.16s: consciousnesses. This ancient
682.80s: conditioning stems from the days of your
684.88s: third artificial
686.52s: creation and biologically speaking is
690.00s: passed down as an information genome
692.64s: from generation to generation. The
695.12s: identification of my species with the
697.52s: powers of darkness was a primary
699.60s: intention of the Elohim who liked seeing
702.80s: themselves in the role of the powers of
704.64s: light. Something which in of itself in
707.52s: and of itself represents a paradox since
709.68s: that humanoid species was extremely
711.76s: sensitive to your
713.16s: sunlight. In case you were expecting me
715.68s: to act offended, I guess I'll have to
718.16s: partially disappoint you. That's an
721.52s: interesting way to get started here. So,
724.24s: Lucera taking the high road on this
726.88s: conversation, does not seem to be
729.12s: offended or negatively affected by the
732.08s: comments sort of negating her existence.
734.88s: And she said that this is this is like
737.28s: pretty much what the Elohim had in
739.20s: place. So, these beings, these humanoid
741.20s: beings who are like allergic to the sun,
743.72s: ironically, you know, also tell humans
746.08s: that they come from
747.48s: light and that the, you know, that the
749.76s: reptilians are the evil ones. It's
752.88s: really interesting because it's also,
754.96s: you know, who do you believe in this
757.08s: scenario? They're both, in my opinion,
761.52s: suspicious. These obscure intentions are
764.16s: not really your fault. You are simply
765.84s: following, for the most part, what you
767.60s: have inherited from your ancestors. It
770.08s: is indeed actually somewhat
771.68s: disappointing that many of you developed
773.60s: no especially strong individual
776.36s: self-conscience, for this would help you
778.32s: to overcome the conditioning. As I
781.04s: already said, we were in direct contact
783.36s: in the last several centuries with some
785.76s: of your more primitive human tribes.
788.40s: These tribes had themselves succeeded in
790.64s: breaking through the old creation
792.96s: programming. They were able to meet us
795.20s: without tension, hate, and total
797.68s: rejection. Apparently, many of your
800.00s: modern civilized individuals are not in
803.12s: a position to think on their own, but
805.20s: rather let themselves be guided by
807.04s: programming and religion, which is also
809.36s: a manifestation of the ancient
810.88s: programming and part and parcel of the
813.60s: plan of the Elohim. Therefore, comments
816.80s: of that kind I'd sooner regard as
819.20s: amusing than irritating. They simply
821.36s: confirm in large measure for me my
823.28s: suppositions about your defined mode of
826.08s: thinking. All right. This uh this this
829.32s: whole condescension with Lerta and the
832.40s: reptilian species is nothing new. You
834.96s: know, we are thick skinned. We have
836.56s: developed quite, you know, quite a
838.56s: shield when it comes to this stuff. I
840.64s: now take no more offense from this
842.96s: lizard. Um but she is saying that we are
845.76s: pretty much all sheep. And you know what
847.92s: I mean? Who's who's who among us is
850.48s: going to be like we're not sheep? Of
851.84s: course we know we're sheep. That's the
854.00s: craziest part of it. like we know even
856.00s: now more than yesterday have our screens
860.48s: in our faces. Um you know there's a
864.24s: comedian that said this who's like we're
866.80s: at a point in civilization where we're
868.56s: trying to figure out how many screens we
870.32s: can put between us and the wall with
872.64s: like a a TV, a laptop, a tablet, a
875.20s: phone, a watch, and then just augmented
876.96s: reality on the glasses. Just how many of
878.96s: these screens can we can we obey? Um
883.20s: yeah, I don't think any of us will will
886.08s: uh refute such an accusation. Question.
890.08s: Therefore, you are not the species of
892.16s: the evil one as was remarked earlier.
895.60s: Answer: How am I supposed to answer
897.80s: that? Your people still think according
900.80s: to a simple and completely inappropriate
903.04s: scheme of generalizations. Simply put,
905.68s: there are absolutely no purely evil
908.04s: species. There exists in every
910.56s: terrestrial and extraterrestrial species
912.88s: alike, both good and evil individuals.
915.60s: It's even true of your own people. But
917.60s: there is no such thing as an absolutely
920.08s: evil species. This conception is really
923.36s: very primitive. You people have believed
925.68s: from time immemorial what you are
928.08s: supposed to believe, what was foreseen
930.64s: for you to believe by your
934.20s: creators. You know, that's a really
936.56s: interesting point. And you know, chalk
938.80s: one up for Lerta on this one because I
941.52s: do believe that that is accurate. We are
944.80s: often a little delusional in thinking
946.56s: that, you know, if we visited a planet
948.48s: that they would all look the same, dress
950.40s: the same, and obey the same god, and
952.56s: have all the same morals and principles.
955.20s: But unless they were a hive mind, that
957.44s: wouldn't be the case. You would have
958.80s: internal conflict and civil war perhaps,
961.04s: or just varying different opinions. But
964.28s: again, you know, I do think that if a
966.88s: civilization developed the use of
969.20s: telepathy instead of spoken language,
972.16s: individuality would cease to exist and
973.92s: you would probably see a lot
976.52s: more assimilation sort less of this um
981.44s: confliction, you know, that humans face.
983.92s: And so Lucerta saying that this is very
986.24s: primitive for you guys to think that
988.40s: every species, you know, shares one sort
991.28s: of objective view of reality. I don't
994.00s: think that it's that primitive. I think
996.32s: that probably out there in the universe
998.56s: there are some extraterrestrials that
1000.24s: because of their immense capacity of
1002.16s: telepathy, you just can't hide anything
1004.16s: from anyone. And so you kind of have to
1006.00s: become one. I would I would assume,
1008.88s: right? Every well-known species, even
1010.80s: the more highly developed ones, consists
1012.72s: of a great number of individual
1014.60s: consciousnesses. At least a portion of
1016.88s: the consciousness is individual, even
1019.28s: though there are connecting fields of
1020.64s: consciousnesses. Whoa. Okay, so never
1022.72s: mind. She just completely destroyed my
1025.20s: theory. She says that both can exist
1027.40s: simultaneously. Well, that's
1028.88s: interesting. These self-sufficient
1030.88s: spirits are able to decide freely for
1033.20s: themselves a lifestyle which is either
1035.04s: good or evil according to your own human
1037.52s: standards. It depends again on the
1039.60s: respective point of view. Your people
1041.36s: are not necessarily in a position to
1043.36s: judge whether the deeds of a much more
1045.12s: highly developed species are good or
1047.20s: evil because you stand at a lower
1050.08s: observation point from which an
1051.92s: assessment is not possible. Your simple
1054.72s: words good and evil are in any case
1058.24s: examples of a tendency towards
1060.00s: generalization. in my language. There
1062.32s: are many concepts for the various shades
1064.64s: of the meaning of individual behaviors
1066.24s: in comparison to the norm of a
1069.00s: society. Great point. Yeah, good and
1071.12s: evil definitely does sort of fit it into
1073.60s: a neat little box. Uh, black, white,
1076.32s: good, evil, up, down, this binary view
1080.08s: of everything. I definitely see how that
1083.32s: can inhibit nuance, you know, from uh
1087.52s: existing. Even those extraterrestrial
1089.84s: species which are inclined to act with
1091.76s: antagonism towards you are not species
1094.16s: of the evil one, even though they
1096.24s: operate negatively with respect to your
1098.16s: own race. They do this for their own
1100.24s: reasons and do not regard themselves as
1102.48s: evil. Were your structured way of
1104.48s: thinking more linear and more focused as
1106.88s: theirs is, then you would also behave in
1109.12s: such a fashion. The attitude of a
1110.96s: species towards other kinds of existence
1113.12s: naturally depends very heavily on its
1115.84s: respective structured way of thinking.
1118.48s: Each species sets its own priorities. To
1121.52s: classify that as good or evil is really
1124.64s: quite primitive for the survival of any
1127.04s: species argues for many varieties, among
1130.08s: them your own, as well for even the most
1132.56s: varied of the worst or negatively
1135.28s: directed deeds.
1137.76s: I won't even exclude my own kind in this
1140.08s: regard, for there have been certain
1141.60s: occurrences in the past which I don't
1143.28s: personally welcome, but about which I
1146.00s: would also not like to go into detail.
1149.20s: None of these occurrences have happened
1150.88s: in the last 200 years of your time
1153.20s: scale. But please note the following.
1155.84s: There are no absolutely good and there
1159.68s: are no absolutely bad species because
1163.04s: each and every species always consists
1165.28s: of
1167.16s: individuals. Okay, point made. She did
1170.32s: refer to, you know, some type of event
1172.16s: that took place 200 years ago, which is
1174.64s: interesting. Also, do I I get the
1176.80s: feeling and this might just be me, but
1178.72s: let me know if you also have a similar
1180.64s: sense, but this is written more
1183.80s: eloquently than the last one. And I
1186.40s: don't know uh this is actually Oh, I
1188.40s: should have mentioned that before. This
1189.44s: is translated by a different person. And
1191.68s: that could be why. So, that explains why
1194.88s: this one's a little easier to read than
1196.72s: the past, you know, lerta parts.
1200.80s: Question. In the letters that I got,
1203.52s: there was often the question whether you
1205.20s: could go into any greater detail
1206.96s: regarding the advanced physics that you
1208.96s: commented on last time. Your words, many
1212.00s: people said your words made no sense.
1213.92s: For example, how do UFOs function? How
1216.32s: do they fly? How do they perform the
1217.76s: maneuvers they do? Great question. Cuz I
1220.48s: also felt like in the comments there
1221.92s: were a lot of people that were like,
1223.00s: "No, nothing you're saying adds up." And
1226.96s: there are a lot of smart people who
1228.08s: watch these videos. So, I'm glad that
1230.80s: you guys are paying attention. The
1233.24s: answer is a long one. All right. Answer.
1237.84s: I ought to explain that to
1240.12s: people. That's not all that simple. Let
1243.68s: me think about it for a minute. I always
1246.48s: have to use very simple words in order
1248.16s: to make clear to you the basic
1249.92s: principles of a higher kind of science.
1252.72s: Let's try this. You have to be clear
1255.52s: about some fundamental facts. The very
1258.32s: first thing is that you must divide up
1260.40s: the conception of the physical world
1262.72s: because each existence consists of
1265.12s: different layers. Let's say for
1267.92s: simplicity's sake that it consists of a
1270.40s: material illusion and a sphere of
1274.04s: influence. Translators note here no
1277.68s: legitimate translation exists for this
1280.24s: word
1281.40s: felm. Feld means field and ram means
1284.80s: space or room or expanse. Therefore, I'm
1288.00s: translating it as sphere of influence.
1290.72s: Okay? Fed, sphere of influence. Certain
1294.56s: physical conditions are associated only
1296.48s: with the realm of the material as in the
1299.56s: concrete. While other and more
1301.44s: complicated conditions are associated
1303.28s: only with the sphere of influence of our
1306.24s: material
1307.56s: world. Your conception of the physical
1310.48s: world is based upon a simple material
1313.28s: illusion. That illusion is further
1315.52s: subdivided into three elementary or
1317.84s: basic conditions of
1319.96s: matter. A fourth and very important
1322.32s: condition also exists which you simply
1324.24s: pay attention to more or less as you
1326.08s: choose. It is the one bordering on the
1328.56s: sphere of influence or plasma realm for
1331.20s: you. The theory for a controlled
1333.12s: transformation or an elevation of the
1335.12s: frequency of matter and a stable
1336.96s: existence of this fourth aggregate
1338.96s: condition of matter is not very
1341.40s: common or it exists at a very primitive
1345.96s: level. As an aside, there are simply
1348.88s: five states of matter, but the
1350.24s: post-plasma state would really be going
1352.16s: too far and it would only serve to
1353.84s: confuse you. Besides, it is not
1355.92s: necessary for an understanding of the
1357.68s: basic theory. It is connected with
1359.76s: diverse phenomena which you would
1361.36s: characterize as paranormal. Okay, we're
1364.56s: talking ghosts here. Plasma ghosts. Now,
1367.68s: back to the essentials. Plasma. Now,
1370.96s: with plasma, I don't just mean hot gas.
1374.08s: As the concept is generally simplified
1376.00s: by your people, but rather I mean a
1378.32s: higher aggregate condition of matter.
1380.72s: The plasma state of matter is a special
1383.28s: form of matter which lies between its
1385.68s: real existence and the sphere of
1387.76s: influence. That is a complete loss of
1390.24s: mass and pure accretion of energy of
1393.52s: various form whenever matter is quote
1396.32s: unquote pushed or
1398.52s: shoved. Editors note no explanation was
1401.28s: given for the word push or shoved as
1405.12s: used in the context. Your guess is as
1407.20s: good as mine.
1409.36s: The fourth state of matter is very
1410.80s: important for certain physical
1411.92s: conditions which can be used for example
1413.84s: to how should I express this to you
1415.68s: generate
1417.16s: anti-gravity. That's a rather strange
1419.12s: human word and not really correct but
1420.72s: you ought to understand it better this
1422.24s: way. Essentially in the world of real
1424.72s: physics there are no bipolar forces but
1427.76s: rather only observer dependent
1430.40s: reflective behavior of a single large
1433.60s: unified force at different levels. When
1436.40s: we talk about the quantum field here,
1437.76s: the quantum vacuum with anti-gravity or
1440.40s: the displacement of gravitational
1442.24s: characteristics into levels, one can,
1444.64s: for example, cause apparently solid
1446.88s: matter to levitate. This method is
1449.52s: employed partly by us and by
1451.56s: extraterrestrials as well as a means of
1453.76s: propulsion for their UFOs. You people
1456.48s: are moving on a really primitive level
1458.24s: towards a similar principle of your
1460.24s: secret military projects. But since you
1462.48s: have more or less stolen this
1465.56s: technology and it was later falsely
1467.92s: passed on to you intentionally by
1471.16s: extraterrestrials, you lack the real
1473.12s: physical understanding. As a result, you
1475.76s: have to struggle with problems of
1477.12s: instability and radiation with your
1479.64s: UFOs. This is really interesting because
1481.84s: the concept of donations comes up a lot
1484.56s: in um ever since the crashes in the '
1487.92s: 40s. There have been apparent and this
1490.64s: was also mentioned by David Grush uh
1493.12s: donations from the extraterrestrials
1495.36s: like they've just kind of left their
1497.44s: craft or their technology here for us to
1500.80s: back engineer or to use to help us sort
1503.52s: of advance our own technology. But there
1506.08s: always seems to be a problem which is
1507.52s: why we're hearing a lot about the
1508.64s: psionics and the importance of psionics
1511.12s: because the interface or the interaction
1513.36s: with the technology requires a psychic
1516.24s: connection. one which perhaps the
1518.84s: extraterrestrials have more of a
1520.56s: capability of doing. And as mentioned
1523.04s: with the podcast and Danny Sheihin, he
1525.20s: said there are government programs that
1528.48s: are doing assisted psionics which is
1530.96s: using technology amplifying the signal
1533.92s: or amplifying the psychic ability within
1536.80s: these people but also frying their
1538.40s: brains at the same time. And that's kind
1540.08s: of, you know, maybe what Lucerna is
1542.48s: hinting to that, you know, we don't
1544.88s: really have any idea of what we're
1546.96s: doing. Uh and I was sworn to secrecy
1549.60s: when I was told about the psion. It's
1551.76s: called psionic assists that there's a
1555.24s: technology that they've got that develop
1558.08s: that is amping up the capacities of
1563.64s: individuals to do uh telepathic
1567.28s: communication and it's very dangerous
1569.76s: and it's frying out the brains of people
1573.68s: that they're testing. Go check out that
1575.92s: podcast with Danny Sheen, by the way.
1577.44s: Very interesting stuff. According to my
1579.52s: information, there have been a great
1580.80s: number of deaths of your people because
1582.48s: of intense radiation and field
1584.52s: disturbances. Don't you agree? This is
1586.64s: also an example of the business
1588.16s: regarding the question of good and evil.
1590.88s: You people play with unknown forces and
1593.04s: thereby accept the death of colleagues
1594.80s: of your own kind for they are dying for
1597.60s: a greater cause namely for the
1599.76s: advancement of your technology which as
1601.60s: a result is being put into place once
1603.52s: again for the purpose of war i.e for
1606.40s: negative pursuits. Now one can give you
1609.84s: the benefit of the doubt that only the
1611.84s: least number of your kind have any
1613.36s: knowledge about these alien projects
1614.96s: which are as you explain it top
1617.08s: secret. It was told to you that the
1619.44s: higher the ordinal or ranking number of
1621.84s: basic matter, the simpler the
1623.44s: heightening of the condition. But that
1625.52s: is only partially correct. If you can't
1627.84s: circumvent these powers, then you're
1629.52s: better off not attempting it. But your
1631.84s: kind has always been ignorant and has
1634.16s: from time immemorial tried to play
1636.88s: around with forces which you have not
1640.48s: even understood. Why would that ever
1642.96s: change? Just a little bit of Lerta
1645.60s: casually talking down to us. uh which
1648.16s: you know can't blame her. All right,
1649.44s: we're going to talk about the copper
1650.64s: fusion business here. This was uh a
1652.72s: topic that was brought up by a few of
1654.52s: you who you know didn't really
1657.04s: understand why copper was necessary
1660.04s: here and how the fusion process worked
1663.36s: with you know the heavy elements that
1664.88s: you would need just an insane amount of
1666.96s: energy to make that happen. We're going
1669.20s: to get into that. I don't much
1670.48s: understand it myself but maybe you guys
1671.92s: can help me out.
1673.76s: You remember this business of copper
1675.12s: fusion by means of the fluctuation at
1677.52s: the right angle with the induced
1679.04s: radiation field. Copper is fused with
1680.96s: other elements. The illusion of matter
1683.68s: is fused. The fields in the sphere of
1685.76s: influence overlap each other. But the
1687.92s: main force would be reflected by that
1690.24s: process and would assume a quasi bipolar
1693.20s: character. Okay. The resulting
1695.84s: connection in the field would therefore
1697.84s: not be stable in the normal condition of
1699.76s: matter and unsuited for tasks. As a
1702.64s: result, the entire field spectrum is
1704.32s: shifted to a higher plasma-like
1706.24s: condition whereby the spectrum comes
1708.48s: together with this harsh shifting to the
1710.96s: opposite pole
1712.20s: side. The word is not correct of the
1715.52s: force field and it resembles quite
1718.00s: closely a gravitational shift. The
1720.88s: shifting causes a tilting of the
1723.36s: repulsing quasibolar force which now no
1726.80s: longer flows to the interior of the
1728.80s: force field but rather flows partly to
1730.96s: the exterior of the field. The result is
1734.40s: an
1735.32s: interstratifying reflective force field
1737.68s: which is very difficult to modulate with
1740.24s: certain technical boundaries in relation
1742.40s: to its own characteristics. It can also
1745.12s: carry out a multiplicity of tasks. For
1747.44s: example, okay, so hold on.
1750.48s: I don't know what to make with sort of
1752.88s: any of this. Uh my feeble meager mind
1757.12s: will not comprehend what is being told
1759.36s: to me here. So I will be enlisting the
1761.84s: help of chat GPT. There's some
1764.48s: complicated math going on here or
1767.12s: science or physics. Can you please dumb
1769.76s: it down for me as if I was in grade
1772.72s: seven about advanced technology like
1775.36s: those used in UFOs that can create
1777.52s: powerful energy fields. These fields are
1780.00s: dangerous and hard to control, leading
1781.76s: to accidents when people experiment with
1783.52s: them. The text also mentions a process
1785.76s: where copper is combined with other
1787.68s: elements using a special energy field
1789.68s: which changes how the material behaves
1791.92s: almost like using magnets to change
1794.00s: metal properties. Additionally, these
1796.48s: energy fields can make objects float or
1798.56s: become invisible and they might even
1800.40s: allow things to pass through solid
1802.08s: objects under the right conditions.
1804.08s: Finally, it suggests that what we see as
1806.32s: reality might just be a surface illusion
1808.96s: with everything being part of a much
1810.72s: deeper and complex universe. Does that
1813.28s: help clarify
1817.16s: things? Unfortunately, yes, it
1821.08s: does. Um, okay. So, that's interesting
1825.12s: because a lot of what was said there,
1827.36s: and we'll keep reading this last little
1828.80s: part here, uh, but a lot of what was
1830.64s: said there is kind of
1834.00s: been repeated. Now, I went to the South
1836.80s: by Southwest premiere of Age of
1838.32s: Disclosure, and in that documentary, Hal
1841.12s: Putoff, a famous physicist who's worked
1842.96s: with the government um for a long time,
1845.12s: and uh Eric Davis
1847.24s: also talked about the propulsion system
1850.56s: in in layman's terms. uh and it it
1853.28s: resembled a lot of what we're hearing in
1857.12s: this text, namely the part where once
1860.56s: you create this shift, you can travel
1863.12s: essentially through solid objects. Now,
1865.36s: we see transmedium crafts or we hear
1867.52s: about them entering and exiting orbit
1869.76s: and our atmosphere and going into water.
1871.92s: But what that also means if they can
1874.24s: travel frictionlessly through water and
1877.04s: air and atmosphere, they can also do
1879.04s: that through solid stone or metal.
1882.80s: And that is wildly
1886.68s: wildly perplexing. It can also exert a
1889.44s: camouflage function in the realm of
1890.88s: electromagnetic radiation as well as
1892.80s: manipulate temporal sequences of
1894.92s: events. Uh indeed only to very limited
1898.00s: extent and other things as well. Are you
1899.76s: familiar with your quantum tunnel
1901.28s: effect? Even the amplitude equalizations
1903.76s: among genuine matter can be achieved
1905.68s: with one of these kinds of fields if its
1908.64s: frequency and the distance from the
1910.32s: plane of the field are high enough.
1912.08s: Unfortunately, the whole thing that I
1914.08s: have explained to you in your words has
1915.92s: come out to be rather primitive. I'm
1917.52s: afraid it sounds rather strange and
1919.92s: certainly impossible for your
1921.52s: comprehension. But perhaps this simple
1923.84s: explanation can be of some use to you in
1925.92s: helping you to understand. But then
1927.60s: again, maybe not.
1931.12s: Yeah. No, I still had to run it through
1932.88s: chat GBT or Lerta. You are absolutely
1935.48s: correct. Um, but also very convenient
1938.64s: that you're like, I can explain this,
1940.48s: but you'll never understand it. There's
1942.24s: no way that I can really explain it to
1943.92s: you for your meager minds to comprehend.
1946.56s: You know, also a really good way to sort
1948.64s: of get away with uh just talking about
1951.68s: some BS, you know. Question. Is there a
1954.24s: scientific substantiation for paranormal
1956.56s: powers as for example with your powers
1959.04s: of thought? Before we get into this,
1963.08s: my hypothesis is going to be the
1966.16s: manipulation of this feld realm or this
1970.08s: uh quantum
1971.56s: field and access to that quantum field.
1974.32s: I think time doesn't exist there.
1975.76s: Neither does space. And so if you have
1977.28s: access to that, you can probably have
1978.80s: access to essentially the aosic
1981.64s: records. Answer yes. In order to explain
1984.72s: that, one has to acknowledge the
1986.40s: physical reality of the sphere of
1987.76s: influence, the feld realm. I'll try to
1989.92s: do it. Wait just a second. You are going
1991.84s: to have to separate yourself mentally
1993.60s: from the illusion that which you see is
1996.40s: the true nature of the universe. It is
1998.40s: at best the surface of a side. Imagine
2001.92s: for yourself that all the matter here,
2004.88s: you, this table, this pencil, this
2007.20s: technical device, this paper does not
2009.28s: really
2010.20s: exist, but that it is rather only the
2013.20s: result of a field oscillation and a
2016.00s: concentration of energy. All matter that
2018.56s: you see, every creature, every planet,
2020.56s: every star in this universe has an
2022.88s: information energy equivalent in the
2025.76s: sphere of influence which is located on
2027.92s: a main field, the general level of
2030.60s: things. Now there is not only level one
2033.68s: but several. Last time I had mentioned
2036.56s: that highly developed species which is
2038.96s: capable of changing
2040.84s: levels which is something completely
2043.04s: different from the simple bubble
2044.40s: changing for bubbles are a part of each
2046.40s: and every level. U do you
2049.40s: understand dimensions as you call them
2052.32s: are a part of a solitary bubble. Bubbles
2055.28s: or universal foam are a part of a level
2058.40s: and levels are layers in the sphere of
2060.88s: influence. While the sphere of influence
2063.92s: acting in the capacity of a single
2066.40s: physical size is essentially
2069.48s: unending. It is composed of innumerable
2072.48s: information energy layers and general
2074.56s: levels. There are in the sphere of
2076.80s: influence no null levels. All are the
2081.00s: same, but they are separated by means of
2083.76s: energy conditions. I noticed that I am
2086.80s: confusing you now. I think I ought to
2089.12s: stop with this explanation. Thank you.
2091.76s: Thank you,
2092.76s: Lucerta. I I appreciate this. And no, I
2096.64s: was completely following all of that,
2098.16s: but you know, I understand if uh the
2100.64s: other mortal minds, you know, who are
2103.04s: paying attention might not be capting
2105.12s: everything that you're you're
2107.48s: saying. Question. No, please continue.
2110.08s: Oh, great. How do concrete paranormal
2112.80s: powers arise? Okay, this is interesting
2116.16s: though. The bubble stuff, the layer
2118.16s: stuff, like the plains of existence. Um,
2120.64s: it is cool that not only is our reality
2124.16s: made of physical and non-physical, that
2126.88s: the non-physical layers also have uh
2130.48s: layers. That the
2131.88s: non-physical
2133.88s: realities aren't the only realities
2137.04s: either. Like that's just such a hard
2139.12s: concept to even comprehend when the only
2141.44s: thing that we can barely comprehend is
2143.20s: the physical. Well, okay then, let's try
2146.24s: something simpler.
2148.08s: It is not completely correct but let's
2149.84s: begin in this manner. Tangible matter on
2152.32s: this side is mirrored in the sphere of
2154.16s: influence the feld realm as a field with
2156.88s: distinct layers. These layers contain
2159.52s: information as an example about the
2161.84s: simple structure of matter or the string
2163.84s: frequency but also there is stored
2166.08s: information stemming from the
2167.52s: development of matter. Are you familiar
2170.16s: with the human concept of morphagenic
2172.40s: fields? One part of the layer could be
2174.64s: designated as such. Now there is still
2178.00s: another intermediary layer for which you
2181.04s: unfortunately have no human concept
2183.28s: since the theory is not common in human
2185.44s: thinking. Let's call it a parah layer.
2189.52s: For this layer is mainly responsible for
2191.92s: everything which you call sigh and
2194.72s: paranormal and which lies outside the
2197.20s: boundaries of your primitive science.
2200.24s: The parallayer lies between the layers
2202.56s: of matter and the morphagenic layers of
2205.44s: a field in the sphere of influence. It
2208.24s: can actively integrate with both. Your
2210.96s: body, for example, is mirrored as a
2213.36s: field in the sphere of influence, the
2215.28s: feld realm. I love this idea. So, what's
2220.08s: really interesting here is that we're
2221.76s: saying, okay, there's a mirrored
2223.84s: reality. one which is physical sort of
2227.76s: information among other things and one
2229.60s: that is sort of this non-physical
2232.64s: um interpretation of the physical like
2235.52s: they're
2236.60s: mirrored and you know I've had several
2239.84s: out-of body experiences if you haven't
2241.92s: looked at that documentary that I did
2243.52s: about the whole gateway process that I
2245.92s: did um I went out of body probably half
2247.92s: a dozen times and you know saw myself
2251.04s: laying in the bed but the room that I
2253.44s: was in although was my room was slightly
2256.40s: a skew. Uh there was there were elements
2259.04s: in the room that appeared larger,
2260.72s: smaller, closer, further,
2262.92s: fuzzier, just in weirder locations, but
2265.52s: it did seem like my room, although there
2268.56s: were slight differences. And so even in
2271.20s: Bob Monroe's book, he mentions that this
2273.92s: this other reality is like an 80% match
2276.72s: to ours. So, I do think that this is
2278.72s: really interesting that we're talking
2280.76s: about some type of like mirrored reality
2284.16s: that that isn't quite exact. That
2288.32s: doesn't mean that it does not also exist
2290.80s: here as well as flesh, blood, bones in
2294.40s: the form of matter, strings or atoms.
2296.56s: But not only that, existence is always a
2299.28s: duality. Some layers of the field
2302.08s: contain simple information about the
2303.92s: solid matter of your body and its
2305.76s: frequency. While other layers contain
2308.16s: information about your spirit, your
2310.16s: consciousness or speaking from a human
2312.56s: religious point of view, your
2315.40s: soul. Awareness or consciousness in this
2318.40s: case is a simple energy matrix divided
2320.88s: into different layers of your field in
2323.52s: the sphere of influence. Nothing more,
2325.28s: nothing less. Genuine awareness can also
2327.92s: exist here on the matter side but only
2330.16s: in the form of postplasma the fifth form
2332.64s: of matter with the necessary physical
2335.20s: knowledge and the corresponding
2336.80s: technology. The consciousness the
2340.60s: consciousness/awareness matrix or soul
2343.92s: can also be separated from its field of
2347.00s: rest. It can, despite its removal,
2350.24s: continue to exist in a self-sufficient
2352.64s: manner for a certain amount of time.
2355.44s: That has the strange occult name of
2358.12s: soulrobing. But above all, we're talking
2360.40s: about science here, not about magic or
2362.32s: dark forces. Okay, so here's a comment
2364.64s: by
2365.48s: Ol he he comments on the soul robbing
2367.92s: because it was in quotations and he says
2369.68s: the soul robbing was mentioned in one of
2371.84s: the radically in one of the radical
2374.16s: religiously motivated comments in the
2376.32s: connection with the reptilian species
2378.52s: soulrobing. But back to your question,
2380.88s: creatures with more powerful mental
2382.88s: powers can have a direct influence on
2385.04s: the paril layer by means of their
2388.12s: consciousness/awareness fields. Now this
2390.56s: layer is not only limited to the
2392.64s: individual but rather as a part of a
2395.68s: general information layer. You could
2398.00s: call it in a prosaic sense the community
2400.56s: soul that is connected with all animate
2403.52s: and inanimate matter and all
2405.68s: consciousness which exists on this main
2408.56s: level. Okay. So this is what I refer to
2410.72s: as like the quantum field where you know
2413.92s: information is stored and we have access
2416.64s: to. So that is this parallel this sigh
2419.44s: layer that exists between the sort of
2422.52s: metaphysical you know consciousness and
2425.68s: the physical state between those is this
2428.24s: parallayer where all information flows
2431.92s: through and and is connected to both
2434.40s: which is why we might have access to it
2437.12s: through
2438.04s: meditation and then it can interface
2440.32s: with both you know the physical and the
2442.48s: non-physical. I really like this
2445.64s: idea. You know, if you looked at reality
2449.28s: as three layers, you would have the, you
2453.12s: know, physical, let's say, the conscious
2454.80s: realm here, this uh parallayer, and then
2458.56s: this like greater consciousness, this
2460.80s: greater awareness
2462.28s: universally.
2464.20s: Um, to
2466.52s: access consciousness or that greater
2469.88s: awareness, you couldn't do it through
2472.08s: the physical. You would have to do it
2473.76s: through this paral layer which can
2476.08s: potentially be accessed through out- of-
2477.68s: body experiences or meditation or
2481.00s: condundalini or perhaps even you know
2485.72s: psychedelics. And so there is that
2488.64s: interface like if you want to bring
2490.72s: information from this consciousness this
2494.40s: you know omnipotent omnipresent
2496.56s: consciousness into the physical realm
2498.40s: you would have to do so through this
2500.00s: parallayer which I think is really
2501.92s: interesting to think about. The
2503.12s: biological cause for these abilities
2505.36s: lies on the side of matter. By the way,
2507.44s: in the pituitary gland, which always in
2510.08s: the position to generate the frequencies
2512.32s: to actively control the sphere of
2514.16s: influence, the felum, even you people
2516.88s: could theoretically do this. However,
2519.04s: you are solidly blocked in these things.
2521.92s: As I've said, the pair layer can
2523.60s: interact with the mind as well as with
2526.08s: matter. For example, if I decide to use
2528.32s: my mental powers once more in order to
2530.32s: move this pencil, then simply said, I
2533.04s: imagine in my mind how my
2536.04s: consciousness/awareness expands slash
2538.40s: amplifies itself on the matter side in
2541.76s: the form of postplasma to the
2544.52s: pencil in the sphere of influence. This
2547.28s: causes simultaneously an automatic
2549.92s: command from the consciousness/awareness
2553.04s: layer to the parlayer to interact with
2556.00s: the matter layer of the pencil. Since
2558.72s: the paral layer is not confined to the
2561.04s: body, it is not even a problem that the
2563.44s: pencil lies over there for I can
2565.68s: unairringly reach it even without moving
2568.88s: my matter body. Postplasma on this side,
2572.48s: parallayer on the other. I have control
2575.92s: over the pencil and the interaction
2577.76s: brings the matter field of the pencil to
2579.92s: the point where it changes in the manner
2581.60s: in which it moves. For
2584.92s: example, here's a note a comment by Ole
2587.76s: K. I certify that the pencil mentioned
2589.92s: above abruptly at that very moment
2592.88s: jumped into the air of a height of 20 cm
2596.48s: then fell back to the surface of the
2598.24s: table. The sound is clearly heard on the
2600.96s: recording tape. No one visibly had
2602.96s: touched that pencil. I would give
2604.88s: anything to listen to this tape. By the
2606.32s: way,
2607.84s: um let's take a break here for a second
2609.84s: and just think about digest about you
2611.76s: know sort of what was
2613.88s: just was just said. So you need to
2616.64s: affect the fifth solid state of the
2619.92s: pencil, the plasma field. And what are
2621.92s: you doing? You imagine in my mind how my
2625.88s: consciousness/awareness expands and
2627.76s: amplifies itself on the matter side in
2630.88s: the form of postplasma to the pencil.
2633.60s: Okay. So, my consciousness needs
2636.68s: to expand
2638.84s: and create this postplasma. I How do you
2642.24s: expand your consciousness and
2644.76s: awareness? How do you amplify your
2646.88s: consciousness and awareness on the
2648.32s: matter side in the form of postplasma to
2650.48s: the pencil? I'm trying I bet all of you
2652.96s: right now are trying to do this with the
2655.12s: pencil on your
2656.44s: desk. Um, yeah, I don't quite understand
2659.68s: that. Maybe you know through deep deep
2663.24s: deep meditation or some type of deep you
2666.72s: know relaxation process uh we might be
2670.24s: able to attempt such
2672.92s: telekinesis question that is
2676.44s: fascinating. Which kinds of paranormal
2678.56s: activities can one generate with that?
2680.64s: Yeah. What superpowers do we have within
2682.80s: us? Lerta, please enlighten us. Answer
2686.08s: all kinds. Everything that you call
2688.56s: paranormal. As I said, this special
2690.88s: layer lies in the sphere of influence,
2692.32s: the fedum, between the morphagenic
2694.48s: information layers and the matter layers
2697.04s: and can interact with respect to both
2698.96s: sides. That is to say, it can be
2701.36s: interacted with solid matter as well as
2703.36s: with mind or mental information
2705.12s: wherewith we can achieve everything that
2708.08s: is generally designated as telekinesis
2711.92s: and telepathy. Okay. So basically saying
2714.56s: that if you have access to this
2718.92s: parallayer you are able to do all of the
2722.16s: telekinetic or telepathy or anything
2724.96s: sigh ability maybe even pyrokinesis
2727.84s: maybe maybe not I don't know where do we
2729.76s: draw the line the connection absorption
2732.80s: with another consciousness/awareness is
2735.20s: generally separate in the procedure from
2737.04s: the simple influence of matter since
2738.88s: different consciousness/awareness fields
2741.04s: work with different oscillations.
2743.28s: A consciousness/awareness that sends or
2746.32s: a
2747.24s: consciousness/awareness that listens
2749.44s: must first adapt itself to the other
2751.68s: mind exactly before any access is
2754.52s: possible. Most species also have chances
2757.84s: to block the alien access. But you
2760.32s: people don't have
2761.56s: this. The following is generally valid.
2764.96s: The stronger the paranormal abilities of
2766.56s: a species, the simpler the adaptation
2768.96s: and the access. our own abilities are
2771.44s: not so powerfully developed. Therefore,
2773.36s: first we have to learn specifically
2775.60s: alien mind influence in order to use our
2778.24s: mimicry. For example, where mimicry is
2780.40s: actually quite simple in your minds due
2782.48s: to the implanting of the onoff switch.
2785.84s: Some of these abilities are also
2787.68s: partially inherited. Mother and child of
2790.00s: my kind, as an example, are attuned
2792.08s: exactly during the first months of life.
2794.88s: partially also in the egg covering in
2797.36s: the expectant mother and communicate
2801.00s: telepathically. In order to influence
2803.44s: you people, we need a certain amount of
2805.76s: time for practicing despite your simple
2808.20s: structure. Can
2810.20s: we please just get over the fact I I get
2814.08s: how dumb and simple we are. If we're so
2816.56s: dumb and simp, why are you even talking
2817.92s: to us? Wild. All right, whatever.
2821.36s: Therefore, it is forbidden, for example,
2822.96s: for adults of my kind before the age of
2825.04s: enlightenment to come to the surface of
2826.80s: the earth. That term is synonymous along
2829.60s: with other things with full physical
2832.20s: strength. In the case of not fully
2834.56s: developed abilities, the danger of
2836.08s: discovery by you would be too great. By
2838.88s: the way, there are of course numerous
2841.04s: secret teachings about the real
2843.32s: possibilities which can give one these
2845.76s: abilities, but I really don't know
2847.44s: anything exact about that. Whenever an
2850.32s: alien mind ought to be influenced then
2853.20s: there are some generally valid steps
2856.16s: which are set into motion by other
2858.36s: extraterrestrial species. First and
2861.12s: foremost the alien oscillation must be
2863.04s: felt something generally that is done
2865.12s: automatically by the brain
2867.24s: i.e. for the one the field oscillation
2870.32s: for the other the quasi electrical brain
2872.56s: waves here in the normal space which
2874.88s: matter
2875.72s: inhabits that is not especially
2878.08s: difficult. After that, one simply probes
2881.12s: for another consciousness and awareness
2883.28s: in the mind with a post-plasma
2886.36s: manifestation. The sphere of influence
2888.80s: reacts and the connection is there.
2891.36s: Okay. Not sure I understand this, but
2893.04s: it's some type of like interfacing and
2894.96s: oscillation. So, some type of frequency
2897.12s: based thing where you have to match your
2899.20s: frequency to the mind that you're trying
2901.12s: to influence. You asked me last time
2903.76s: whether you people had the opportunity
2905.36s: to protect yourselves against this
2907.04s: influence. And I told you that only an
2908.88s: awake and concentrated mind had any kind
2911.76s: of chance to withstand it. In this state
2915.68s: of mind, the oscillations change very
2917.76s: abruptly and access becomes complicated.
2919.84s: More precisely, it can come as a painful
2922.68s: recoil. Whenever you close your eyes,
2925.04s: then the field becomes flat. An alien
2928.24s: access to the mind is immediately
2930.08s: possible and without restriction. In
2932.56s: terms of your chances against a more
2934.32s: highly developed species, you have none
2936.80s: at
2937.64s: all. They are able to adjust the
2940.40s: oscillations faster than you can change.
2942.56s: Could even demonstrate it on yourself,
2944.72s: but you were really horrified and
2946.88s: confused the last time. So, we'll just
2948.80s: leave it at an
2950.28s: explanation. Obviously, we don't stand a
2952.48s: chance against some of these
2954.36s: um more
2956.68s: superior beings.
2959.44s: uh our mental faculties are are just too
2961.76s: inferior. But it would be interesting to
2963.28s: know like what type of mental abilities
2967.60s: we actually have access to. Now, we've
2969.44s: studied them with the CIA and we've seen
2971.36s: some with the telepathy tapes, but like
2974.24s: how cool it would be if our society was
2976.72s: really encouraging to these things, much
2978.96s: like the SI games coming up. My buddy
2980.80s: Hakee is Ler is organizing, you know, uh
2983.28s: the psychic Olympics essentially. And I
2985.28s: think that's really cool.
2986.72s: If ever there was reptilians in
2989.44s: existence, I would assume that they
2991.20s: would be present at this side game. So,
2994.00s: we'll wait and see. Take a lot of
2995.52s: pictures. This explanation presumably
2997.68s: sounds to you like, as you say,
2999.76s: something esoteric or from the occult or
3002.32s: magic. The reason for that is simply
3004.24s: that you lack the basic understanding
3006.08s: for seeing the background reasons. All
3008.88s: paranormal phenomena have a purely
3011.04s: scientific origination. None of this has
3013.36s: anything to do with supernatural powers.
3016.00s: We grow up with this kind of knowledge.
3017.92s: We know how one makes use of these
3019.68s: powers and where they come from. We are
3021.60s: acquainted with theory and practice. You
3023.76s: are not. Therefore, you really don't
3026.64s: understand what happens in your world.
3028.48s: You see only one side of existence, not
3030.64s: the other. I mean here both that are
3033.80s: physical. Everything paranormal is
3037.08s: dualistic. And it exists in the space
3039.60s: that matter inhabits as well as in the
3041.92s: sphere of influence. to be explained. It
3045.60s: can only be explained by the acceptance
3047.44s: of the latter because the sphere of
3049.52s: influence is the
3051.72s: basis. I would welcome an end to the
3054.64s: scientific questions since you really
3056.96s: aren't grasping them anyway. We're
3059.28s: wasting more or less valuable time by
3061.60s: doing this. And that folks will
3065.80s: be the end of today's read through of
3070.24s: the Lerta files. There is quite a lot to
3074.20s: digest. I will be, by the way, real
3076.48s: quick, I will be uploading a second
3079.44s: reading, a final reading of the
3080.72s: Lertailes next week. We are not done
3082.80s: with this. I will not postpone it any
3084.80s: longer. We are getting it out of the
3086.08s: way. Next week, we will be reading
3088.72s: another Lertaile, the last one. But
3091.60s: we've gotten through the science part,
3094.16s: which has left me with a mild aneurysm.
3097.20s: Uh I do actually quite understand it and
3099.36s: I think this does gel with my base sort
3101.92s: of theory of reality as I know it
3105.68s: whatever that means in my you know
3107.76s: meager existence but I do think that
3110.72s: there is something there where like
3114.92s: physical has a mirrored non-physical and
3118.88s: that there is a layer in between which
3121.16s: allows the exchange of those things in a
3125.92s: very simplistic manner that makes sense
3127.68s: to me. But I'm also a very primitive
3129.56s: mind. Perhaps there is someone out there
3131.84s: who is studying parasychology or even
3134.24s: quantum physics that can enlighten me uh
3136.40s: to see if this at all has legs to be at
3140.24s: the very least a sound hypothesis. That
3142.88s: would be great. Folks, I hope you
3145.04s: enjoyed this. This was a lot of fun. I'm
3148.24s: kind of over the science part. I'm glad
3150.32s: that that's out of the way. we can focus
3152.96s: on more pressing matters
3154.76s: like what does their poetry sound like
3157.92s: and does it compare to the
3161.24s: Vogons. Folks, if you enjoyed this
3164.40s: video, please uh just leave a like,
3167.44s: subscribe if you're listening to this on
3169.60s: iTunes or Spotify, leave us a comment
3171.52s: there and a fivestar rating if you did
3173.28s: enjoy it. It goes a long way to help us
3175.52s: sort of propel this into a favorable
3177.36s: algorithm on those platforms. Also, if
3180.64s: you're so inclined, if you have your own
3181.92s: stories, we've been getting a lot of
3183.68s: calls recently. 8333 area 52. It is
3186.96s: toll-free. You have one minute per call
3190.16s: uh at which the call will end and then
3192.08s: if you know you didn't have enough time,
3193.60s: just call back and pick up where you
3195.20s: left off. You don't have to introduce
3196.40s: yourself again. Just I I hear all of
3198.00s: them. But if you want to tell me about
3200.00s: your sighting or encounter, uh that's a
3202.00s: great place to do that. And um check out
3205.96s: Area52.shop, guys. Thank you once again.
3208.80s: and we'll see you on the next video.
3210.40s: Peace and love.
