2.48s: I was visiting my brother in Colorado
5.28s: Springs and we were hiking on a trail up
8.80s: Cheyenne Mountain which is where you'll
11.28s: find NORAD headquarters. As we were
13.76s: walking up the mountain trail, this very
15.92s: elderly woman, white hair, etc. Um came
19.28s: walking down towards us. My brother at
21.52s: the time was telling me how him and his
24.08s: friend saw some red orbs there late in
26.72s: the evening one day. Uh he said he
29.20s: really thought it was intelligent the
30.96s: way they were moving around. As we
33.28s: passed the old lady, she said, "You do
35.12s: see strange things on the mountain
36.64s: sometimes." And then headed further past
39.76s: us. We got about another half mile up
42.80s: the trail and the same woman came
45.12s: walking from uphill and past us again.
49.04s: We both just stopped stunned and watched
51.44s: her as she walked by. She tipped her hat
54.16s: and smiled and then stepped into the
56.48s: woods.
58.00s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
59.20s: another episode of Debriefed. My name is
60.64s: Chris Ramsey. And today we're going to
62.96s: be taking a little bit of a break from
64.48s: the Matilda Mroy story of the alien
66.72s: interview and this alien that they've
68.48s: captured at Roswell that told us that
70.56s: our souls are doomed prisoners that are
73.44s: stuck here for at least another 5,000
75.20s: years. I thought we'd change it up a
77.60s: little bit. Now, two reasons behind
79.68s: that. One, I think if I keep reading the
82.32s: book, it just at what point does it, you
84.48s: know, become plagiarism? like I can't
86.72s: just read the entire book. It's
88.32s: definitely not my intellectual property
90.64s: and it's not something I intended on
93.20s: doing fully. I wanted to kind of dive
96.32s: into some of the meteor parts of it and
98.08s: I think we were able to do that. Now, if
100.16s: you want to know how the story turns
101.76s: out, definitely buy the book. You know,
103.76s: it's something I've always left in the
105.20s: description. I encourage you guys to
106.40s: check it out and support the author or
108.00s: at least his estate at this point. And I
110.88s: think it's time to move on to greener
113.04s: pastures, as they say. The second reason
116.60s: was I want to get into some other
119.52s: theories. I want to get into some other
121.36s: things. I feel like the longer we
124.44s: spend locked in on this singular idea
129.16s: of, you know, this being a prison planet
131.76s: and these bodies being sort of these
133.68s: containers for our souls, which may or
135.28s: may not be true, by the way. I think the
136.88s: more time we spend away from other
138.40s: things that might also be true that we
141.12s: should be looking into namely and one
143.20s: thing that I wanted to get into on this
145.60s: channel I think probably more than
147.84s: anything at all was the idea of talking
151.76s: to experiencers and that's something I
154.56s: want to do more and more you know the
157.04s: people that have really inspired me
158.88s: throughout this journey have been those
161.20s: who've worked I think closely with
164.16s: direct contact experiencers or you know
167.60s: otherwise known as abductees in some
170.24s: cases. People like Bud
172.20s: Hopkins, John Mack, David Jacobs, even
176.08s: Linda Molton How. I think if you want to
178.80s: know what the inside of a UFO looks
182.52s: like, you could talk to people like Bob
185.32s: Lazar or perhaps other people working on
187.68s: the legacy program.
191.08s: Or maybe, just
193.48s: maybe, you can hear out some of the tens
197.28s: of thousands of accounts of people who
201.44s: say that they were abducted and taken
203.04s: aboard these crafts. You know, I'm
204.64s: rereading the book Abductions by John
208.64s: Mack, who is a Harvard trained
211.08s: psychiatrist, and he really has a good
214.40s: grasp on
216.36s: obviously the human mind, and he's, I
219.68s: think, someone you can really reference
221.60s: when it comes to the abductions,
223.68s: especially because he definitely tackled
225.84s: it from a skeptical point of view until
229.44s: he was faced with so much overwhelming
232.48s: human testimony and you know anecdotal
235.36s: evidence but also physical evidence of
237.20s: like markings uh from these experiencers
240.48s: or abductees that he was forced to
242.48s: broaden his worldview and that's
243.92s: something that he really eloquently
246.00s: states in his book is that there are
248.48s: three types of things three types of
250.88s: directions you can go when you hear
252.88s: these accounts from these people. One
256.08s: ignore it
257.08s: completely.
258.84s: to try to fit it into the current model
262.48s: that we have going. And that seems to be
265.20s: what most people end up doing is, oh,
268.48s: these people are just having a psychotic
271.20s: break or experienced some physical
273.36s: trauma when they were younger or are
275.76s: hallucinating or have gone mad or are
278.16s: making it up for money. This is how we
281.44s: fit that into our current model. Now,
283.68s: sometimes that might be the case, but
286.32s: when faced with so many cases of people
289.68s: who don't know each other saying the
291.60s: same things that at the time were not
293.52s: reported on, were not publicly known or
296.28s: widely understood among, you know, the
299.44s: public, these very, very niche ideas and
304.28s: frankly procedures that were being done.
307.68s: You're forced to do the third thing.
309.68s: you're forced to broaden your current
312.16s: model, broaden your perception of your
315.52s: world. You have no choice. And that's
317.84s: something that John Mack faced. He felt
321.12s: with the overwhelming evidence, I think
322.88s: he had a hundred cases over 3 years
326.00s: before he wrote this
327.48s: book. And he was convinced beyond a
330.16s: shadow of a
331.72s: doubt that this was
334.36s: real. That we weren't just simply
336.88s: dealing with people who believed that it
338.72s: was real. That we were dealing
341.80s: with this being a
344.36s: reality. These people were of sound
346.52s: mind. Sure, some of them had traumas,
348.96s: some of them didn't. It wasn't a
350.64s: particular type of person. It was kind
353.64s: of all around the spectrum
356.60s: of human as far as human characteristics
359.68s: and traits go. So really hard to
362.16s: pinpoint a psychological
365.16s: event on such a vast variety of people
370.32s: like that. You can't just paint it with
371.92s: a broad brush stroke. And so, yeah, he
373.76s: was forced to broaden his worldview and
376.80s: accept the fact that these instances of
379.04s: missing time, which is what he first got
381.44s: into with these
383.08s: individuals, was a result
386.52s: of some type of
389.00s: abduction by what seemed to be
392.20s: extraterrestrials. And today, folks, we
394.24s: are going to look at just that. Now,
395.84s: before we do, highly encourage you guys
397.44s: leave a like, subscribe, hit the
399.28s: notification bell, or leave us a review
401.68s: over on Spotify if you're listening to
403.52s: this. All of those things are free and
405.76s: they help this channel immensely. So, if
408.40s: you want to show a little bit of
409.44s: appreciation, just do that. You don't
410.96s: have to do anything more. And if you
412.16s: want to take it a step further, head
413.60s: over to our shop at area52.shop. We got
415.92s: some cool merch there that also directly
418.32s: supports us. Everything is shipped out
420.16s: of here, and we take great pride in the
422.16s: things that we do. And lastly, if you
424.00s: want to take it even further, you can go
426.40s: ahead and become what we call an intern,
428.64s: otherwise known as joining the
429.76s: membership either here or on Patreon,
431.28s: where you get extra episodes, weekly
433.12s: vlogs, access to the book club, access
434.96s: to movie nights, so much more. All
438.44s: right, I think we paid the bills. Let's
441.68s: get into it. Today, we are going to be
444.48s: looking at a very special case. This
447.92s: came out on Reddit
450.48s: uh four years ago, so
453.16s: 2021. There was a Reddit post under the
456.08s: subreddit known as
459.40s: R/abductions. And this person
462.64s: uh
463.48s: describes what they believe to be an
466.68s: abduction and not only an abduction, but
469.92s: a Q&A with these aliens. They allowed
472.80s: him to ask questions and he was allowed
475.28s: to retain the memories and have the
476.76s: answers. Hey, sorry for interrupting.
479.68s: Um, I accidentally keep calling this
481.68s: person a he. It's actually a she. I find
484.00s: that out later. I assumed it was a he.
486.24s: Don't know why. So small. Just ignore
489.36s: that. Ignore me. Go right back to Sorry.
492.00s: Sorry for the interruption. Couldn't let
493.36s: it slide. All right. See you. Whether
495.68s: this is true or not is not up to me to
497.60s: decide, but I would highly encourage you
500.00s: guys to suspend your disbelief at least
501.68s: for the next few, you know, maybe hour
504.00s: or so. And let's give this a chance to
507.52s: make its way into our subconscious and
509.92s: see if this rings true for us and
512.16s: perhaps gleans any truth on the
514.32s: question, the broader question of uh ET
517.44s: contact. I'm feeling good today. This
519.36s: coffee is great. Everything's good.
520.88s: We're rolling here. The title reads as
522.64s: follows. My abductors helped me with my
525.76s: anxiety and saved my parents' lives so I
528.32s: can do a mission for
530.28s: them. Crazy bold statement. I'm hooked.
534.24s: I'm listening. I've been questioning as
536.64s: to whether I've been abducted for the
538.08s: past few days, especially after making a
540.96s: post about whether I've been abducted or
542.72s: not. But then, just as I was coming to
544.96s: terms that I was abducted and wouldn't
546.96s: remember anything, the aliens I met
549.48s: before came back.
552.40s: At this point, I feel obligated to share
554.64s: my story. So, here it
557.08s: is. Okay. So, let's just make a quick
561.20s: reference to the previous post in the
563.36s: same subreddit coming out and saying, "I
565.12s: think I was abducted." He details the
567.04s: time he saw Flying Saucer, which we'll
568.80s: get into uh and all of this. And then
571.36s: several days later after posting that,
573.40s: apparently he was contacted and
576.00s: confirmed and given his memories back.
578.08s: Okay. Highly suspicious off the bat. I
581.20s: agree.
582.24s: But let's hear it out. Truth is often
584.64s: stranger than fiction, and I'm not going
587.28s: to dismiss it just yet. So, let's keep
589.60s: reading. P.S., this is a bit of a long
591.76s: story since it chronicles my entire
593.92s: abduction experiences up to this point.
596.96s: This isn't even getting into the absurd
599.12s: and possibly alien experiences that my
602.32s: family has witnessed. Regardless, this
605.60s: post will take a while, so be prepared
608.32s: to read. Oh, we're prepared. We've been
611.92s: prepared. PSS, I don't remember the
614.48s: exact exact dialogue. I simply restated
617.84s: the dialogue in the best I could
619.84s: remember. Fair enough. To start, my
623.04s: first abduction happened when I was 10
625.44s: back in July of 2013. I snuck outside to
628.96s: my backyard to look at the stars, which
630.56s: I often did when I was young since space
632.56s: has always fascinated me, even
634.92s: today. That was when I saw it. Through
638.40s: the couple of clouds in the sky that
640.32s: day, I saw the bottom of a saucer with
643.84s: its lights shining on me. Initially, I
648.32s: didn't remember anything. After that, I
650.16s: woke up several hours later in my bed,
652.24s: just confused. But, as discussed later
654.88s: on in the story, I was given my memories
656.80s: back, and I can describe what this
658.96s: abduction entailed. The next thing I
661.08s: knew, I was within a rather large room,
664.64s: which I could assume is within the
666.72s: saucer itself. Here's a recreation of
669.52s: what the room looked like. And this is
671.36s: pretty cool because we do have an
672.96s: instance here, you know, just like Joe
675.52s: McMongle, the famous remote viewer, also
678.24s: was a really good artist, he was able,
680.32s: his renditions of his remote viewings
682.16s: were so precise and exact because of his
683.92s: artistic skill, you know, that it really
687.12s: helped out with a lot of his work. But
689.28s: in this case, we do also have an artist.
691.76s: Uh, this person does digital art and is
694.00s: able to provide us with more than just
696.72s: some weird sketch. Like, if I drew out
699.04s: maybe something that I'd experience,
700.56s: it'd look like a 2-year-old drew it. But
702.48s: this person has has more skill than
704.72s: that. So, here's the first image, and
706.24s: this is of inside the saucer. So, we're
708.56s: looking at a pretty barren, large white
711.88s: room. Uh, no real features to reference.
716.72s: pretty much simple circular white room
718.88s: with nothing in it and a single curve
721.44s: connecting the floor to the ceiling.
723.44s: Although there was no visible light
725.00s: source, it seemed as though there was
727.60s: light coming from the center of the
729.44s: floor and the ceiling. Once again, we
732.16s: find ourselves inside a barren, cold,
736.24s: almost lablike environment. Very
739.00s: sterile, you know, perfect for a
740.96s: procedure, if you will, but also echoes
743.20s: some of what the 4chan whistleblower was
745.76s: talking about when these things were
746.88s: built to spec. No extra things. You
749.84s: there aren't any doors or any weird, you
753.76s: know, there's no artwork. There are
755.20s: there aren't any stools just sitting
757.36s: around. Everything is there because it
759.04s: has a purpose. And if the purpose isn't
761.92s: to do anything extra, then those extra
763.92s: things are not there. They're not even
765.04s: there just in case. It's very
767.36s: missionoriented, it seems. There I was
769.44s: on a steel table, face up and
773.40s: paralyzed. Four short grays around me
776.08s: and were using strange metal tools,
778.32s: mostly tools that looked like small
780.72s: steel rods, but they had a lot of them
783.60s: in their hands. If you're curious about
786.00s: how the grays look, they look very
788.40s: similar to the cover of the book
790.36s: Communion. As we all know Whitley
794.24s: Strieber's famous book Communion, yeah,
797.48s: typically that is a depiction of the
800.08s: grays. Now, it's interesting because the
801.92s: smaller grays in a lot of these books,
804.08s: especially David Jacobs, he touches on
806.16s: this quite a bit in that the smaller
808.48s: grays seem very much sort of task
811.32s: oriented and almost like they do the
814.00s: grunt work. Now, they still have the
816.24s: ability to be psychic apparently, but
818.96s: they're the ones who will undress the
821.52s: abductee in a lot of these cases. or if
823.84s: the abductee gets scared and
826.64s: accidentally, you know, urinates on the
829.36s: floor due to sheer terror and fear.
833.04s: Well, these guys are going to be the
834.16s: ones mopping it up and they do that. And
836.80s: so they do all these little menial
839.28s: tasks. Um, and then the taller ones
842.08s: usually come in for the proceduring.
844.72s: They moved their tools around my chest
846.96s: and stuck tools up my nostrils and ears.
849.76s: They also pointed green lasers at my
851.84s: eyes and stuck needles into my
855.80s: forehead. Very interesting. All things
858.16s: that you hear about, but never at once.
860.40s: So, that is kind of interesting. The
862.48s: Long Rods, by the way, is definitely
864.72s: something that has existed. Now, what's
867.60s: interesting is that there's this old
869.24s: Gumby episode, and I I've I think I've
871.84s: played this before in the past, where
873.44s: Gumby gets abducted, and it is your
878.92s: quintessential abduction scenario with
882.88s: the Grays. And they also say, "We've
885.44s: exchanged abductions to help our future
888.32s: selves, and we've given you technology
890.32s: in exchange. Wildly deep episode of
892.72s: Gumby." Uh, but they do also hold this
895.52s: long rod, which I think Whitley touches
897.92s: on. I think there's a lot of abductees
900.08s: that that talk about this rod and
902.96s: sticking things well up, you know,
905.12s: people's nostrils. It hurt a lot. I was
909.44s: hyperventilating in pain, in confusion,
911.92s: in fear. It felt traumatic at first, but
915.84s: then all the pain stopped when I heard
917.60s: it.
920.48s: Calm down, my sweet child, rang in my
923.56s: mind. It was a telepathic
926.28s: message. Through the wall, a tall gray
930.00s: phased through a floating white chair.
934.40s: She wore a long, long dress with the
937.28s: same shade of royal blue as the shorter
940.44s: grays. She was looking right at me. I
944.00s: knew the voice came from her
947.00s: somehow. Upon her saying that, all fear
950.48s: and pain washed away from my body. Even
953.60s: though there were tools and needles in
955.12s: my head at that point, I felt calm,
958.36s: happy, comfortable even.
961.96s: Now, this is very interesting cuz here
964.48s: we sort of, you know, touch on a little
966.88s: bit of this female entity again that was
969.84s: described by Whitley Strieber and so
971.60s: many others.
972.92s: Um, you have a taller like Gray that
977.84s: seems to be somewhat in charge at least
980.72s: of the procedure. It stayed like that
982.88s: for what felt like a couple more
984.76s: minutes. With me happy, the woman
987.60s: staring at me and the four grays
989.68s: touching my head with tools. Eventually
992.64s: though, the four grays stopped working
994.80s: on me. I, still paralyzed, suddenly
998.32s: started being lifted in the air. The
1000.88s: bottom of the room lit up in a blinding
1003.80s: light, and before I knew it, I was back
1006.96s: in my backyard. Except this time, I was
1009.92s: levitating in the air while the four
1011.92s: grays before were nearby me. It was
1014.72s: still nighttime when the grays walked
1016.24s: towards my house. They opened my back
1018.32s: door without even touching it and
1020.48s: levitated both me and themselves through
1023.12s: the house. Soon enough, they placed me
1025.52s: in my bed, causing me to fall asleep. I
1028.72s: woke up at 5:00 a.m. sleeping on my back
1030.96s: in my bed while my sheets were
1032.56s: straightened, which isn't normal at all.
1035.04s: I normally sleep on my side and my
1036.88s: sheets aren't straightened when I wake
1038.56s: up. This is something that shows up
1041.36s: quite a bit as well uh in abductions.
1043.92s: You hear about people who've gone
1045.88s: camping and suddenly wake up, their
1048.96s: clothes are outside or their pants are
1050.56s: on backwards or their shoes are on the
1052.32s: wrong feet or their shoes have dirt on
1053.84s: them and they're in their bed like kind
1056.32s: of a botched operation. Sometimes they
1058.72s: they they don't know exactly that we're
1060.88s: creatures of habit and will recognize
1062.56s: these things. Between my first and
1064.40s: second abduction, I had nightmares,
1067.28s: repeated nightmares. Looking back, many
1069.28s: of these nightmares depicted a distorted
1071.52s: form of my first abduction. However, my
1074.48s: memories were initially wiped of my
1076.16s: first abduction, so I wasn't able to
1077.60s: figure out the source of these strange
1079.16s: nightmares. Often times, my nightmares
1081.60s: featured me being in a dark room pursued
1084.08s: by shadowy figures and being entirely
1086.48s: helpless. Interesting little uh moment
1089.44s: here because so many experiencers
1093.20s: whether abductees or whether just people
1094.96s: who uh meet come in contact with these
1097.04s: beings depict some of sometimes they
1099.36s: depict them having blurry faces or
1101.60s: wearing a mask or being shadowy almost
1104.64s: like there is some type of
1106.60s: psychic alteration that they're capable
1109.76s: of doing. like they don't actually have
1111.60s: to wear a mask, that they can just
1113.60s: change your perception of them in a way
1116.72s: that distorts your memory of
1118.60s: them. Everything changed though when I
1120.88s: learned how to lucid dream at age 13.
1123.20s: Being sick of nightmares, I searched for
1125.20s: ways online to try to get rid of
1126.64s: nightmares. And one of those things was
1128.08s: lucid dreaming. For whatever reason, I
1130.72s: picked up lucid dreaming absurdly quick.
1133.12s: I had sleep paralysis, but only twice
1135.12s: before I learned how to lucid dream
1136.96s: nearly consistently. Within a month, I
1139.60s: went from having constant uncontrollable
1142.36s: nightmares to having pleasant lucid
1145.20s: dreams almost every night. If you're
1147.76s: someone out there that suffers from
1149.04s: sleep paralysis, there definitely is a
1151.36s: lot of literature on how to roll out of
1155.28s: that because you're essentially in the
1156.96s: out-of body state. You just don't know
1159.52s: how to leave your body. So, you're kind
1160.96s: of confined and panicking. But
1163.12s: apparently, there's some there's some
1165.12s: work there that you guys can look into.
1167.20s: I've never had sleep paralysis. I have
1168.96s: had multiple out of- body experiences,
1170.56s: but I know that that even those out-of-
1172.32s: body experiences are terrifying. So, I
1173.76s: can imagine how much more so it would be
1175.92s: if you couldn't move during that event.
1178.00s: How you guys liking this so far? I think
1179.52s: this is
1180.76s: interesting. For unknown reasons, I also
1183.04s: began to have dreams that predicted the
1184.76s: future. Most often, they would depict a
1187.76s: storm like a tornado or thunderstorm
1190.08s: about 3 days before some of these storms
1192.16s: appeared. I've also had dreams predict
1194.32s: the bodies but not faces of people I
1197.36s: would meet in the future and my
1199.52s: relationship with them. Most often
1201.56s: friends and even dreams predict rooms
1205.12s: that I'd be in despite me having never
1208.00s: been in said rooms. These clairvoyant
1210.64s: dreams happened once every couple of
1212.64s: weeks
1213.48s: uncontrollably and would feel stronger
1215.60s: than a normal dream and or even a lucid
1218.40s: dream. Regardless, as time went on, I
1221.28s: improved my lucid dreaming skills more
1223.04s: and more over the next few years. As I
1225.76s: grew to ages 14, 15, and 16, my control
1228.56s: over my dreams became stronger and more
1231.00s: effortless. Now, that seems to track if
1233.44s: you're into lucid dreaming. It it is
1235.20s: something you can practice. There's work
1236.96s: by a parasychologist uh by the name of
1239.68s: Rupert Sheldrake as well that really
1243.20s: talks about how some dreams have
1246.12s: precognitive elements in them and that
1248.80s: he encourages dream
1251.08s: journaling which is basically keeping a
1253.60s: journal by your bedside and any
1255.12s: recollection you have of the dream just
1256.80s: write it down because those memories
1258.16s: fade pretty quickly as I'm sure most of
1259.84s: you know and that if you jot down some
1262.24s: of the elements that are present in
1264.16s: these dreams you might find that some of
1266.80s: them might actually end up being
1268.80s: precognitive, meaning they predict
1271.12s: things that will happen. We've also seen
1273.12s: precognitive events in out-of- body
1275.44s: states. Uh I made a three-part series on
1278.40s: the gateway and leaving your body. In
1279.92s: the third part, we talked to Graham
1281.96s: Nichols who left his body and during
1285.44s: then witnessed an explosion on Old
1287.84s: Compton Street in London. This was
1290.40s: witnessed by five other people that he
1292.32s: told five other people about this and
1294.08s: then 5 days later an actual bomb
1296.56s: exploded at that very location in the
1298.88s: pub that he said it was going to explode
1300.48s: in. I don't dismiss the
1302.92s: precognitive idea so quickly. This is
1305.68s: going to be the forefront of science in
1307.12s: a few years. I guarantee it. Then came
1309.20s: my second abduction. I went to sleep on
1311.20s: the night of April or May 2019. I was 16
1315.32s: then. At the time, I had papers stuck in
1318.56s: my right ear. A bit of a weird story,
1321.68s: but I have hearing I have a hearing
1323.20s: sensitivity due to my autism. And before
1325.68s: I chose to get noiseancelling
1327.44s: headphones, I would block out noise by
1329.60s: covering my ears with crumpled paper.
1332.32s: One of the crumpled bits got stuck in my
1334.32s: right ear, though. So, oops. Anyways,
1338.40s: unlike last time where I was conscious
1340.40s: on my trip from the craft, I simply
1342.48s: appeared standing in a small corridor of
1344.40s: sorts. At first, I tried to check if I
1347.44s: was dreaming, which I do by attempting
1349.28s: to manipulate the world, checking my
1351.36s: hands to see if they look normal, etc.
1354.08s: But to my surprise, it seemed as though
1356.48s: I wasn't dreaming. To my left of that
1358.48s: corridor was a wall of several switches,
1360.96s: lights, and latches. It looked sort of
1363.84s: similar to the front of a really old
1366.08s: computer of sorts. Naturally, I didn't
1368.72s: bother touching any of them. To the
1370.64s: right were two short grays. standing
1373.44s: there in the same blue jumpsuits that I
1375.44s: saw them before. I felt terrified at
1378.00s: first, of course, especially since I
1380.72s: forgot about my first abduction at that
1382.44s: point, but then I saw the tall alien I
1385.12s: met before telepathically saying the
1387.12s: same things she said before. Calm down,
1390.00s: my sweet child. My sweet little child.
1393.60s: My fear washed away as the two aliens
1396.32s: and I walked towards her. The room we
1399.28s: were in looked exactly like my abduction
1401.20s: room, except I had four beige doors that
1404.48s: looked like this. These doors are
1406.32s: capable of sliding upwards for someone
1408.56s: to go through them. The two aliens took
1411.52s: similar metal tools to the ones they
1413.84s: used last time, although they didn't
1415.52s: stick any needles into my head or
1417.20s: anything. They just quickly move the
1418.88s: tools around my body. The gray on the
1421.52s: right did notice something in my right
1423.20s: ear, though, and reached in using these
1425.20s: metal clamps to pull it out. My first
1428.16s: thought was, "Who are you and what am I
1431.60s: doing here?" Which she responded with,
1434.64s: "I am your watcher. I will answer your
1437.52s: other questions later."
1440.16s: "Now follow me," she telepathically
1442.80s: said, and I followed her through a beige
1445.20s: door that opened by sliding upwards. The
1448.08s: window showed outer space. It looked
1450.48s: beautiful, but it was more or less
1452.80s: space. My watcher told me to look at
1455.76s: her, which I followed obediently.
1458.08s: Staring into her big, deep eyes, I can
1460.64s: tell her eyes weren't just pure black,
1463.52s: but were rather a very, very dark blue.
1467.60s: Her skin was also relatively a bit more
1470.48s: green compared to the other shorter
1472.64s: grays I saw
1474.28s: earlier. After staring into her eyes for
1477.12s: a bit, she then said that now you can
1480.72s: see. I looked back through the window
1482.80s: and my goodness, it was space, but far,
1487.60s: far more magical. It looked like your
1489.84s: typical artist's painting you'd see when
1492.00s: searching up HD wallpapers of space, but
1495.52s: somehow even better than that. It's like
1498.56s: I could see red-like hues, green and
1500.80s: yellow like hues, and purple like hues
1503.68s: that were hues that you normally
1505.20s: couldn't see in real life. My watcher
1508.08s: told me that this is what I could see if
1511.76s: I could master my mind. I then woke up
1515.28s: laying on my back with straightened
1517.04s: sheets once again. At the time, I woke
1519.76s: up with no memory of what actually
1521.36s: occurred, although I did notice later
1523.92s: that day that the paper stuck in my
1525.76s: right ear was completely gone. In
1528.16s: addition, in the following years, I
1530.48s: would have lucid dreams where I could
1532.00s: see colors I couldn't see in real life.
1535.36s: I was never sure where these dreams came
1537.44s: from or why they happened, at least not
1539.60s: until recently. So, let's pause here for
1542.72s: a second. I do have a base theory
1545.12s: running currently or a hypothesis that
1547.60s: I'm kind of putting together based on a
1549.60s: lot of research and a lot of stories and
1551.92s: and everything else. And something
1553.52s: really rings true to me, which I'll
1555.04s: eventually get into more deeply once
1557.04s: I've really rounded off, you know, the
1559.68s: uh the jagged corners of this
1561.20s: hypothesis. But I believe to a certain
1563.76s: extent that we are interacting with a
1566.08s: system that we're not directly
1568.64s: interacting with the intelligence behind
1570.88s: the system, but that this system does
1573.04s: have an
1574.28s: intelligence, just not one like you or
1576.80s: me. It's an automated system. I think
1580.48s: it's very procedural. And this system,
1583.20s: you know, could be around for many
1586.00s: different reasons at the same time,
1587.60s: including possibly manipulating or
1590.36s: maintaining the, you know, human
1593.52s: presence on this earth, among so many
1595.76s: other things. Maybe even the flora and
1597.44s: fauna and all sorts of other things. But
1599.28s: I I think that that's kind of maybe what
1603.20s: we're interacting with 50% of the time
1606.16s: is this system. This system has these
1608.32s: beings, these genderless beings that
1610.32s: seem task oriented, that you know do
1612.48s: these mundane tasks. They also have
1614.96s: these larger beings that seem a little
1616.88s: bit more empathetic, that are able to
1619.12s: psychically calm you down, that are
1621.60s: almost there to reassure you constantly
1625.28s: so that the trauma perhaps doesn't
1627.72s: affect, you know, the test subject.
1631.52s: You know, if you go into an enclosure
1634.00s: with a panda, a lot of times they dress
1636.08s: up as pandas, not to alarm them, you
1638.96s: know, and they don't want to affect
1640.08s: their natural habitat because they want
1641.92s: that natural state to develop without
1644.72s: their
1645.96s: interference. And so maybe they're just
1648.00s: trying to calm us down, right, and like
1649.84s: wipe our memories so that everything
1651.60s: remains. And they've seen that, you
1653.68s: know, if they don't do that, there's
1655.76s: trauma and it kind of affects the
1658.00s: subject. But anyways, so really three
1660.72s: things
1662.04s: happen in three things that happen
1664.80s: across the board with the abduction
1667.44s: concerning these type of
1669.56s: extraterrestrials. You know, in regards
1671.60s: to this system, it seems like three
1674.16s: things happen. One, you get taken and
1676.48s: experimented on. And and I don't mean
1678.32s: experimented as in they don't know what
1680.08s: they're doing. I mean there there are
1682.32s: procedures that happen. And there are a
1683.76s: variety of procedures that seem to be
1685.52s: the same uh among abductees but
1688.32s: different between male and female.
1690.40s: Troubling procedures that do
1692.44s: happen. Number two, after the procedure
1695.60s: is done, you're given a
1698.04s: tour of the ship. A lot of
1701.48s: times people are given a tour of the
1704.48s: ship and are shown beautiful things.
1707.92s: Kind of what's happening right now. Even
1710.00s: in the case of Chris Bledsoe, he was
1711.76s: given the tour where he said he was in a
1713.84s: bubble looking around. They showed him
1715.36s: the pyramids. They showed him all these
1716.72s: beautiful things on Earth. These tours
1720.24s: happen across the board again. And the
1723.84s: last thing they do, and I don't know if
1725.84s: that's what we're going to get into, but
1727.12s: the last thing they do is they show you
1730.08s: terrible things. They show you nuclear
1732.64s: blasts and famine and war. And you know
1736.16s: if you go back to Rua Zimbabwe, the
1738.72s: children um that witnessed the 60s some
1742.48s: odd children that had witnessed this
1744.00s: craft land and these beings come out and
1745.68s: they were you know psychically shown
1748.08s: these images of the world ending and so
1751.68s: many other abductees again including
1754.16s: Chris Bledsoe were shown these terrible
1757.20s: things as if saying look what you're
1759.76s: doing smarten up you need to change. It
1762.56s: seems like that is pretty par for the
1765.20s: course and it seems like it might be an
1766.88s: automated system at this point because I
1768.80s: think a lot it's it's too
1772.68s: frequent and it gives
1775.64s: nothing. I I suppose it adds reassurance
1779.36s: to the person who was taken in that,
1782.80s: hey, look, we're doing this for the
1784.16s: greater good and we're actually taking
1785.84s: care of you and sort of leaving you with
1788.40s: not such a foul taste in your mouth and
1791.68s: perhaps to some extent justifying the
1793.92s: terrible things that they're doing to
1796.12s: us. Like, no, we're not the bad guys.
1799.12s: You're the bad guys. We're just trying
1800.64s: to help you here. Look how bad you are.
1803.84s: And then we kind of leave being grateful
1805.36s: and thankful for the uh horrendous
1808.48s: procedures that were just done and the
1810.00s: fact that we were stolen out of our
1812.20s: beds. Um you know and so it does seem to
1816.40s: be like some weird automated system. The
1818.00s: second reason I believe that is because
1820.00s: what what what has come from that? What
1821.76s: has come from showing any of these
1823.28s: people the end of the world? Nothing.
1825.68s: These people will they they don't go on
1827.80s: to you know change the laws or or what
1831.04s: what they grow up to to speak at
1833.80s: conferences to to other people who are
1835.84s: interested in UFOs or they get so
1838.32s: psychologically traumatized that they
1840.24s: become reclusive and we don't hear about
1843.20s: them. So surely they know that telling
1845.44s: us these things won't change the world.
1848.64s: Why continue to do it? Well, the answer
1850.96s: is it's probably just
1853.40s: programming hypothesis
1855.80s: only. Sorry for that
1858.96s: uh parenthesis, that large parenthesis,
1862.08s: but this is something I've been thinking
1863.12s: about quite a bit after reading, you
1864.80s: know, a lot of books on it. And it does
1866.96s: seem to match up in a certain way. But
1869.04s: let's see what this gentleman or I don't
1871.04s: even know, is this male or female? What
1873.60s: this person has to say? 3 years later,
1875.52s: 19 years old, I was abducted about 1:00
1877.60s: a.m. on October 30th, 2021, when the
1880.08s: third abduction occurred. At this point
1881.84s: in time, I was beginning to research
1883.68s: about the UFO and UAP phenomena out of
1886.00s: curiosity for the past month. Over time,
1888.24s: however, I began to piece together that
1890.16s: maybe, just maybe, a lot of weird things
1892.48s: had occurred in my life, from my
1894.64s: nightmares to my family's
1896.68s: experiences and being able to see
1898.88s: strange shadow entities, among other
1900.96s: issues, was entirely because of me being
1903.96s: abducted. As I was walking downstairs to
1906.32s: get a midnight snack, I saw the tall
1908.88s: alien, my
1910.28s: watcher, standing right by my front
1912.88s: door. Judging by the height of the door
1916.16s: that I measured after the abduction, I
1919.20s: could tell that she's about 7'2 or 7
1921.84s: foot 3, so 2.18 to 2.21 m tall. Despite
1926.72s: seeing an unwanted being in my house,
1929.04s: seeing her made me feel calm somehow. As
1932.24s: I heard the same phrase I heard before
1934.72s: in my head, "Calm down, my sweet little
1937.04s: child."
1941.44s: Wanting to get evidence, I lifted up my
1944.16s: phone, which was in my hand at the time,
1946.96s: and rushed to turn it on. But the
1949.52s: instant I even thought to capture her on
1951.92s: camera, she vanished.
1954.08s: "Come downstairs," I heard in my
1957.32s: mind. I came downstairs, albeit
1959.84s: cautiously. I had my phone on to capture
1962.08s: them on camera and was ready to yell to
1964.00s: wake up my parents if anything bad
1965.60s: happened. The second I walked into my
1967.28s: kitchen though, I saw four short grays I
1969.84s: saw earlier, and my vision blanked out.
1972.56s: My first thought was to check if this
1974.96s: was a dream by checking if my hands
1976.88s: looked normal than trying to manipulate
1978.56s: the world around me. I'm a pretty good
1980.80s: lucid dreamer at this point, so I
1982.24s: figured out how to discern dreams from
1984.60s: reality. Both checks, however, seemed to
1987.04s: suggest that this was in some way
1989.72s: reality. My watcher said, "Look at me."
1992.72s: and I looked. As she stared into my eyes
1995.92s: and I into hers, my forgotten memories
1998.24s: of my past abductions came flooding
2000.88s: back. I am your watcher. Her voice
2004.16s: echoed in my mind. But you can call me
2007.44s: mama. After that, I felt dizzy for a
2010.00s: bit. She continued to stare at me while
2012.56s: I had to close my eyes. Over the next
2015.36s: couple of seconds, a dozen thoughts a
2017.60s: second rushed into my mind. I answered
2019.76s: all of your questions, she said
2021.60s: telepathically in her soothing voice.
2024.72s: I'll list these questions and answers
2026.40s: towards the end of the post to let the
2028.48s: story continue. She then told me through
2030.72s: a separate telepathic message that we're
2033.20s: contacting you because your family has
2036.08s: great psionic potential. However, your
2039.28s: anxiety is getting in the way. She
2041.20s: lifted me up in the air without lifting
2042.88s: a finger and moved me across the room
2045.20s: onto her lap, cradling me like a baby.
2048.40s: Look at me again. Looking into her deep,
2051.44s: dark blue eyes, I heard her in my mind
2054.56s: say, "Calm down, my sweet little child."
2057.36s: Or should I say, "Calm down, my sweet
2059.84s: little girl." I must have had a positive
2061.92s: reaction to the latter because she
2063.76s: started repeating, "Calm down, my sweet
2065.84s: little girl." in my head over and over
2068.16s: and over again. It felt soothing and
2071.40s: euphoric, like I've never felt this
2073.52s: comfortable in my entire life.
2076.04s: Eventually, what seemed like hours, she
2078.64s: said, "If you ever get scared or feel
2080.96s: pain, just think of me, your mama."
2084.16s: Okay. The last words I heard before I
2086.88s: fell asleep in her arms was, "I need to
2090.00s: learn astral projection next. We'll come
2092.96s: back once you mastered
2094.92s: that."
2096.92s: Um, weird. The whole mama thing is super
2100.16s: weird, but the whole Yeah. The I I guess
2102.88s: the whole motherly feminine
2105.40s: energy perhaps is something that they
2109.56s: feel deep down. It's what would soothe
2112.72s: us the most is like the voice of a
2116.28s: mother cradling you. I think that would
2120.64s: be the best way to calm anyone down. I
2123.04s: couldn't think of a better way of
2124.40s: feeling more comfortable than the
2125.84s: feeling of, you know, your mother
2127.44s: cradling you, telling you it's going to
2128.80s: be fine. Interesting strategy here to uh
2132.08s: calm down the human. Suddenly, I woke up
2134.80s: on the couch in my family room at 2:30
2137.52s: a.m., which was weird since I didn't
2139.44s: even enter my family room from my
2141.36s: memory. This was especially weird since
2143.28s: I usually sleep from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00
2145.28s: p.m. or so. I'm never even remotely
2148.08s: tired at this time. At first, I tried my
2150.80s: best to dismiss what happened as a
2153.16s: dream. It couldn't have happened, right?
2156.16s: Wait, does this person sleep from 8:00
2158.16s: a.m. to 3:00 p.m.? They work the night
2160.16s: shift or something? That's kind of a
2161.68s: crazy sleep schedule, if you ask me.
2164.48s: They did mention that they were
2165.76s: autistic, so perhaps there's something
2167.28s: there that uh leads them to be uh more
2171.36s: of a nocturnal person. In addition, I
2174.56s: suffered from daily headaches and body
2176.40s: pains, which was diagnosed as
2178.20s: fibromyalgia by a rheatologist in
2180.92s: February. Even though the headaches and
2183.04s: pains have gotten better as I followed
2185.44s: my doctor's treatment, these headaches
2187.76s: and pains have never fully went
2190.36s: away until this abduction incident. I
2194.40s: have yet to have a headache or pain in
2196.24s: my body since, and it's been nearly a
2198.56s: week when I usually feel these pains
2200.96s: daily. Well, that's interesting. You
2203.36s: know, the the the
2205.56s: healing idea is something that comes up
2208.16s: quite often as well. And again, I, you
2210.40s: know, reference Chris Bledsoe because
2211.76s: he's such a famous case, but there are
2213.60s: so many other cases as well where people
2215.52s: have felt that they've been either
2218.00s: healed or or cured of of certain certain
2222.12s: diseases. Here are the questions I asked
2224.56s: my watcher and that she answered. Now,
2227.28s: we get into the Q&A, folks. Question.
2231.12s: Why did you abduct me? Answer: We abduct
2234.80s: your family line because you and your
2237.04s: family have high psionic
2239.32s: abilities. However, your relatives, she
2242.16s: showed an image of my dad and grandma in
2244.40s: my mind, have ignored the truth for
2247.48s: religion. You're more open-minded.
2252.16s: Question, how long have you been
2253.84s: following my family line? Answered 237
2257.52s: years.
2259.28s: Question: Why did my parents' car
2261.64s: teleport? For context, my parents and I
2264.48s: experienced our car teleporting to a
2266.80s: completely different part of town while
2268.48s: my dad was driving in May of
2270.92s: 2015. Answer to save your parents'
2273.44s: lives. If we didn't save your parents,
2275.20s: this would interfere with your psychic
2276.64s: abilities. Whoa, that's crazy. There
2280.24s: there are accounts as well of people
2282.00s: just driving seeing a bright light or
2284.88s: something and then all of a sudden be
2286.40s: driving in a different direction or in a
2288.16s: different part of town or hours later.
2290.08s: Betty and Barney Hill being a very
2291.68s: famous case of that. But these things
2293.20s: tend to happen pretty regularly. So if
2296.80s: you've ever driven somewhere and had
2298.16s: missing time, you know, perhaps, hey,
2300.64s: perhaps you were being saved. Why did
2302.56s: you wait until now? Answer: We knew you
2306.32s: would come to the conclusion that you've
2307.84s: been abducted. We waited until then as
2310.72s: well as you mastered your lucid
2312.56s: dreaming.
2314.32s: Question, what is behind the four beige
2316.92s: doors? Answer: The deck, the window, the
2320.56s: pilot room, and the engine room. She
2322.80s: made a map of what she believed the
2324.32s: alien ship looked like. It's also really
2326.56s: interesting because a lot of
2328.52s: these ships, and this is very common,
2331.84s: once again, seem to
2335.88s: manipulate space in a way that doesn't
2338.56s: seem possible where the inside of the
2340.40s: craft actually appears to be much larger
2343.52s: than the outside. Are there other rooms?
2346.88s: Answer: Yes. Can I see them? Answer: No.
2352.28s: Question: What are you aliens? You
2355.96s: graze. I like how that's she's like,
2358.80s: "You graze, bro." Answer. For as long as
2362.40s: you live, we cannot tell you or
2364.72s: humanity. This was also the answer to
2367.20s: many other questions regarding the
2368.56s: nature of the universe, their
2369.76s: technology, where they live,
2372.12s: etc. Huh? For as long as you live, we
2375.60s: cannot tell you or humanity. Does tie
2378.32s: into the whole future us
2381.48s: thing. What if the future us, right,
2386.32s: needs to fix something in the past, but
2389.52s: we can't do
2391.72s: it because that'll affect the future us.
2395.28s: That'll that'll make them become us,
2397.84s: which is what we're trying to fix in the
2399.84s: first place, right? So, instead, we make
2402.24s: these aliens that look nothing like
2405.64s: us, so that we don't even come to the
2408.32s: conclusion that that could be us in the
2410.48s: future. and that actually the future us
2413.76s: just looks like
2414.92s: us. You know, much like what Travis
2417.28s: Walton witnessed when he had these
2418.96s: little guys working on him when he
2420.32s: fought them off. He ended up
2421.52s: encountering these humanoid looking
2423.84s: people who, you know, for all we know
2426.00s: hired a bunch of grays, you know, to do,
2428.48s: you know, the mundane work. What
2430.80s: technology do you use? Answer
2434.44s: electromagnetism, I presume, and
2436.84s: psionics. You wouldn't understand if we
2439.44s: told you. This was also a common answer
2441.68s: to many other questions regarding the
2443.12s: nature of the universe, their
2444.40s: technology, where they live, etc.
2447.12s: Question. Is religion real? Answer. Yes,
2451.36s: all are to some degree. All right.
2455.28s: Question. If you're a watcher, what
2457.60s: other aliens exist? Man, these are great
2459.84s: questions. All right. Kudos to the
2461.60s: person who wrote this. These are
2462.72s: fantastic questions. Answer. There are
2465.80s: watchers/observers. those who reproduce
2468.40s: and others. I personally call those who
2470.80s: reproduce breeders. Question: Would a
2473.20s: reproducing alien abduct me? Answered.
2475.44s: No, that would interfere with your
2477.60s: purpose. We specifically have you and
2480.16s: your family marked to not reproduce
2482.72s: with. Question, what is my purpose?
2486.16s: Answer: To learn psychic
2488.52s: abilities. You should also have
2490.72s: children, preferably three or four if
2492.88s: possible, given how well we predict you
2495.44s: can handle children, but we won't force
2498.08s: you to since we know you don't want
2500.72s: children. If you follow what we say,
2503.52s: then this will be the best for both of
2505.28s: us." She then telepathically showed me
2507.68s: clairvoyant visions, including a vision
2510.00s: of what life career I should
2512.84s: pursue, and it was an animator. what a
2516.08s: future romantic partner of mine would
2518.16s: look like and a vision of me floating in
2520.56s: space seeing colors I normally couldn't
2522.64s: see in real life. If I remember any more
2525.28s: questions, I'll be sure to put them
2527.92s: here. The psionic part is really
2530.08s: interesting because this is 4 years ago.
2531.44s: This is 2021 prior to a lot of the quote
2534.32s: unquote psionic talk we've been hearing
2536.16s: about, you know, with Jake Barber and
2538.80s: whatnot and the whole Sky Watcher thing.
2542.88s: Yeah, I'd be curious to
2545.24s: know where this person currently is and
2547.84s: if this person wants to reach out to me
2549.36s: anonymously, I'd be happy to
2551.88s: uh to talk to them.
2554.92s: Skepticism. I've tried telling a few
2557.28s: friends and family some details on what
2559.12s: happened only to be met with skepticism.
2561.44s: To be honest, even I don't fully believe
2563.92s: what I experienced. Maybe it's right to
2565.92s: be
2566.68s: skeptical. Here's some skeptical points
2568.96s: that I've seen others bring up. Okay,
2571.84s: very forthcoming about skeptical, you
2574.96s: know, inquiry, which I think is very
2576.56s: healthy. Perhaps all of my abductions
2578.40s: were just extremely vivid dreams. Dreams
2580.72s: that seemed even more realistic than
2582.40s: typical lucid
2584.04s: dreams. Perhaps my parents' car
2586.24s: teleporting is because my parents and I
2588.08s: just coincidentally fell asleep on the
2589.76s: wheel and drove to the other side of
2591.44s: town somehow, or we just drove to a
2594.00s: completely different part of our city
2595.60s: without all three of us noticing
2597.80s: somehow. Perhaps my anxiety, headaches,
2600.56s: and body pain going away are just my
2602.08s: mind's placebo effects. Perhaps me and
2604.64s: my family seeing shadow entities or even
2606.64s: straight up aliens in real life are just
2608.76s: hallucinations. Perhaps I have a mental
2610.80s: condition I need to check out. To combat
2613.04s: this point, I actually visited two
2614.88s: psychologists regarding me seeing these
2616.96s: strange entities in real life long
2618.72s: before my third abduction and me even
2621.44s: remembering my previous abductions. Both
2623.52s: of them had me do tests to see if I had
2626.32s: anything like schizophrenia. And both of
2628.56s: them said that I'm perfectly sane. Yes,
2630.32s: I do have autism. No, autism does not
2632.64s: cause people to see stuff, see this
2634.64s: stuff rather. Perhaps my family
2636.88s: experiencing all of these things and not
2639.04s: just me exclusively is just inherited by
2641.68s: genetics or passing down
2644.12s: culture. So, some of the skeptical
2646.24s: points don't make logical sense to me,
2648.00s: but hey, this alien counter hardly makes
2650.00s: logical sense. So, honestly, believe
2651.68s: whatever you want to believe. No
2653.48s: judging. Heart emoji. I'm an artist, by
2656.80s: the way. So, if you have
2658.52s: anything that I saw that you want me to
2661.20s: sketch, I can definitely do so. I also
2663.44s: have a myriad of stories of my father,
2665.36s: grandma, great grandma, and siblings
2667.36s: have told me or passed down to me that
2670.00s: might be related to alien abduction as
2671.76s: well. I could post about those if
2673.36s: anybody wants to see that. Edit. Here's
2676.08s: a sketch of the aliens and a sketch of
2677.68s: what the UFO looked like from the bottom
2679.68s: as well. First of all, I want to commend
2683.28s: this person on coming out. You know, if
2686.32s: this is uh completely made up, fine. For
2688.48s: what? 145 likes. Cool. All right. If
2692.64s: this is real, commend this person. I
2694.88s: think they're very brave for um you
2697.60s: know, even talking about it. Even
2699.28s: anonymously, I think is very difficult
2701.04s: to talk about something that so many
2702.88s: people would um
2705.16s: dismiss. Again, even anonymously. I
2707.52s: think if you were to type this out and
2708.72s: just like waiting for someone's response
2710.00s: and it's just negative, negative,
2711.28s: negative, that affects you.
2714.24s: right? As a person, even if no one else
2716.48s: sees it, you're like,
2717.88s: damn, this, you know, kind of sucks that
2721.12s: I can't put put this out there and that
2723.44s: people, you know, will think I'm crazy.
2725.84s: So, good on them for doing that. I'm
2727.60s: curious to know if this person has had
2730.32s: any luck astral projecting, you know,
2732.80s: and wonder maybe if they've watched my
2735.68s: documentary on astral projecting. May
2737.60s: maybe that'll help. Yeah, it makes me
2739.44s: now question the um the voice that I
2742.72s: heard in my
2744.04s: head on the last time, you know, that I
2747.68s: astral projected. Again, if you haven't
2749.12s: watched that three-part series, I I
2752.24s: highly suggest going to watch it. But on
2753.92s: the third part, as I was walking out of
2756.64s: my body, leaving my room, broad
2758.40s: daylight, by the way, I wasn't asleep. I
2760.64s: was meditating, left my body, saw my
2763.04s: body. I go to my window, try to leave,
2765.60s: and I hear a female
2767.80s: voice as loud as as loud as this go,
2772.72s: what are you doing? And the tone was
2775.52s: more like, "What do you think you're
2776.72s: doing?" But it was, "What are you
2777.84s: doing?" And it was a female voice that I
2779.52s: did not recognize. And it was coming
2780.80s: from behind me. And I was like, and I
2782.88s: kind of like froze in fear, saw my body,
2785.36s: went back to my body, didn't look over
2786.64s: there, just like kind of went back into
2788.24s: my body. and then came out of my
2792.12s: meditation. Sounds crazy, I know, but
2794.72s: I'm, you know, I'm not afraid to I'm not
2797.04s: afraid to say what happened, you know.
2799.12s: Why would I be afraid to say what
2801.04s: happened? I'm I'm just relaying what I
2805.80s: perceived, you know, and uh it makes me
2808.88s: a little uneasy reading this because now
2810.88s: I hear about this
2812.52s: voice, you know, this feminine, and now
2815.20s: I'm starting to think, oh, wait, is
2817.28s: astral projecting tied into the
2819.60s: phenomenon somehow? And I always thought
2822.24s: that it was, but never so
2825.40s: directly. So, it's kind of
2828.92s: Yeah. Interesting. Let's look at the
2831.60s: pictures here. So, a sketch of the
2833.52s: aliens. I love how they're like kind of
2835.92s: smiling. Well, at least some of them
2837.28s: are, not all of
2839.32s: them. One, two, three, and four are the
2843.04s: names I've given. I gave the four
2844.96s: shorter grays that I didn't have names
2847.40s: for. Um, one was 53, so about her size.
2851.44s: One was
2852.92s: 5'9, one was 5'6, and one was 49. Okay.
2856.32s: So, they all had a little bit they all
2858.96s: seemed to to have a little bit of a
2860.88s: different feature. They didn't seem
2862.84s: identical, which is cool. And then there
2865.68s: was Mama the Watcher. About 73. Very
2870.00s: interesting. And blue seems to be the
2871.28s: color that these aliens wear for some
2872.80s: reason. Seems to be the garb they chose.
2875.68s: Why blue? You know, that's interesting
2877.76s: because blue is a is a choice. Could
2880.00s: have been red, could have been yellow.
2881.76s: Why
2882.68s: blue? Why not white? something neutral.
2886.08s: Why
2887.40s: blue? Did they think, "Oh, blue is a
2889.68s: common color for humans." Or they're
2892.16s: just like, "No, we like blue. Blue is
2893.60s: sick. Blue is a nice color." Like, what
2894.80s: was the what was the actual decision
2897.28s: behind
2898.76s: blue? That bugs
2901.40s: me. Whoa. Here is the bottom. This is a
2905.12s: great picture, but here's the bottom of
2906.88s: the craft. And I love how they included
2910.56s: it sort of reflecting too with that big
2913.60s: red light. That is super
2915.40s: sick. This person then continued
2918.60s: to answer um a lot of questions. So, she
2922.64s: does say here, uh, "Thanks for the luck
2924.48s: with astral projection. I figured it's
2926.16s: going to take a while to
2927.64s: learn." And someone says, "Not as hard
2929.68s: as you might think. Ever since my
2931.76s: experiences, I found it pretty easy to
2934.08s: do to the point where I almost wonder if
2936.72s: that's because of my alien experiences.
2939.28s: like they just made me super comfortable
2940.88s: with slipping out of my body, like
2942.56s: taking off an old boot. I detailed how
2944.96s: to do it in my thread here, though I'm
2946.96s: not though I'm sure you're probably
2948.56s: aware of this technique. She says,
2950.16s: "Thanks for the info. It's interesting
2951.52s: to read about your simple technique for
2953.04s: astral projection. Thanks so much for
2954.40s: linking your thread. I'll definitely try
2956.00s: your technique out." This person then
2957.92s: says, "Give it a shot. Just this past
2959.68s: week, I had another astral projection
2961.68s: experience, and this time it went a bit
2963.36s: farther than usual. It's all about
2965.04s: walking that tight rope between waking
2966.96s: and sleep, between relaxation and
2968.80s: concentration. The hardest part for me
2970.88s: is that usually once I leave my body, or
2972.72s: so it seems, I immediately start zooming
2974.56s: forward at ridiculous speeds and it just
2977.04s: becomes kind of frightening. Honestly,
2979.28s: this most recent time I started flying
2981.36s: through space and eventually heard a
2982.96s: strange tiny voice which said something
2985.84s: like, "Please proceed to the lower
2988.28s: levels." Then it said something about
2990.56s: checking out the surface of the sun. and
2992.80s: I woke up shortly there after. It was
2995.12s: really weird. I don't blame people who
2997.12s: think it's all a dream or whatever, but
2998.64s: no matter what it is, it's distinctly
3000.72s: different from straight up dreams. In my
3002.48s: experience, astral projection is just
3004.48s: really bizarre, to be honest. It doesn't
3006.32s: really make sense somehow. It's like an
3008.40s: alternate reality rather than simply
3010.40s: being our own reality, but out of body.
3013.20s: It's like nowhere in Silent Hill or the
3015.84s: upside down in Stranger Things, the sort
3018.16s: of offshoot imitation of reality. At
3019.84s: least that's my experience.
3021.96s: 1,000%. That is so well put. And that is
3024.64s: definitely coming from somebody who's
3025.84s: had out-of- body experiences because the
3028.24s: room is the same but like an 80% match.
3030.24s: It's either bigger or smaller or wonky.
3032.24s: It's a little bit off. And again, I'm
3034.00s: I'm in a lucid state. I'm completely
3036.32s: aware that my body is over there in that
3038.72s: I just closed my eyes 20 seconds ago.
3040.48s: Like it's there's no time delay. I
3042.32s: didn't wake up in this thing. I I went
3044.24s: from meditating, taking my headphones
3045.84s: off, closing my eyes to instantly
3047.44s: leaving my body. it it feels like a
3049.80s: weird upside down realm. And someone
3052.64s: says, "I'm sure this is hardly ever
3054.00s: said, but I envy you and your
3055.80s: experiences." And she says, "I've heard
3058.00s: some speak of envy regarding my
3060.72s: experience. Truth be told, I wish some
3062.96s: of this could be passed on to other
3064.40s: people. At the very least, if they could
3066.32s: give us some of their medical technology
3068.48s: knowledge, such as whatever they use to
3070.24s: heal my anxiety and depression, that
3072.24s: would be wonderful, so as to have less
3073.92s: people suffer in the world." You know,
3075.68s: it is really interesting because
3078.68s: we we just completed, you know, a giant
3083.20s: three-part read through on this alien
3085.84s: being named Errol, you know, who said
3087.92s: that our souls are trapped here and that
3090.64s: when we die, you know, we leave our
3092.16s: bodies, but then we're sort of recycled
3093.92s: back into this planet. The astral
3096.32s: projection part of
3098.20s: it comes up here, you know, and then
3101.36s: call that the soul or whatever you want
3103.12s: or consciousness or the your spirit or
3106.00s: whatnot.
3107.40s: But it seems like that might be a key to
3110.32s: all of this and it might really explain
3112.96s: the US government's interest and the
3115.52s: Chinese government's interest and the
3117.12s: Russians government interest
3120.36s: into the
3123.00s: parasychological extrenensory
3125.88s: perception precognitive experiences
3128.72s: psychic connections telepathy
3131.56s: telekinesis all of these amazing
3134.56s: seemingly impossible
3137.00s: feats of the human
3139.72s: mind are
3141.56s: all potentially very closely directly
3146.48s: and importantly related to the UFO
3149.44s: phenomenon. And I think that's why folks
3152.40s: such as Hal Putoff, you know, who
3155.04s: started Stargate back in the day and
3157.36s: other projects
3159.88s: are so closely tied to the UFO subject.
3164.00s: I think that's why I think because even
3166.32s: the psionic stuff we talk about, I think
3168.48s: the astral projection stuff we talk
3170.32s: about, I think it all has to do with the
3173.96s: phenomenon. And now, you know, after
3177.12s: reading the alien
3179.16s: interview, you look at that book as
3182.28s: fiction, but maybe there's something to
3185.88s: it. Maybe it's not all real, but maybe
3189.36s: there is something to it. Maybe there is
3190.96s: some type
3192.44s: of war or exchange going on or some type
3197.32s: of I don't know
3200.04s: containment here on earth that houses
3203.68s: the human spirit and that like you know
3206.08s: we need to sort of free ourselves doing
3208.40s: through these astral projections. Who
3210.08s: knows? It's fun to think about. again,
3212.56s: you know, as I'm reading through a lot
3214.08s: of the Q&A here with uh other people on
3216.72s: Reddit and this individual, she keeps
3219.44s: repeating on how skeptical she is. She
3221.60s: she keeps saying, "Yeah, I'm very
3222.72s: skeptical about the things they told me.
3224.40s: I'm skeptical about everything." You
3226.56s: know, and I think that's a really
3227.76s: healthy way of approaching it. It's not
3229.84s: someone who's trying to force this
3231.28s: narrative down anyone's throat. they
3232.96s: come to this particular subreddit, you
3236.24s: know, to be a little bit more vulnerable
3237.84s: and open and, you know, discussing
3240.00s: possibilities of it not being, you know,
3244.96s: a real thing. A lot of people here
3247.44s: talking about, uh, you know, past life
3251.32s: and reincarnation, it gets as soon as
3254.96s: you talk about the soul's journey, you
3256.72s: know, we we talk about so many other
3258.32s: things here. It just really opens up the
3260.56s: floodgates.
3262.16s: So that concludes my read
3265.00s: through for uh this
3268.36s: particular
3270.44s: post. Bit of a change of pace. You know,
3274.00s: I don't think we've really looked into
3276.48s: the abductee experiencer stuff so much.
3279.68s: A lot of times we've been looking into
3281.92s: government documents or, you know,
3284.48s: whistleblowers. I think that this is
3286.64s: definitely an important topic that we
3288.16s: should be tackling and it's something
3290.72s: that I want to do a lot more of and
3292.32s: there is a
3293.72s: catch22 with approaching this particular
3296.56s: subject and the catch is you know having
3300.24s: experiencers come
3302.36s: forward without
3306.20s: anonymity will
3308.12s: undoubtedly at some point in their like
3310.80s: it it'll change their lives right
3313.20s: because people might start treating them
3315.04s: differently. ly people close to them and
3317.52s: it's a very vulnerable thing and and on
3319.60s: the other side of that I never want to
3322.64s: be exploitative of these people because
3325.20s: the last thing I want to do is monetize
3328.08s: off someone's trauma. Um I'm fascinated
3331.84s: by this and I genuinely want
3336.60s: people to
3339.24s: understand that this is happening. All
3342.16s: right? This isn't just a bunch of crazy
3344.80s: people on Reddit. This is happening.
3347.36s: There's a lot there. And if you decide
3349.92s: to read the books yourselves and not
3352.16s: ignore it or try to fit it into your own
3353.76s: current model and expand your worldview
3356.24s: by picking up some of these books and
3358.56s: reading some of these accounts or
3359.76s: speaking to people who've had
3360.80s: experiences, you will quickly realize
3363.52s: that we are dealing with something more
3365.84s: profound and more authentic than you
3368.96s: might be comfortable.
3372.56s: living with. I believe that there's a
3374.40s: lot of stories out there that should be
3377.16s: told. And I think that the audience that
3379.60s: we're cultivating here, that we're
3380.96s: fostering here at Area 52, for the most
3383.60s: part, is the perfect audience to receive
3386.24s: some of these people as well, because I
3387.76s: think a lot of you and by reading a lot
3389.60s: of the comments and engaging with you in
3391.20s: the different channels that we have seem
3393.92s: to be very open-minded, accepting,
3396.60s: loving, and uh not too cynical, and
3400.32s: definitely um you know, there's
3402.80s: definitely trolls out there, but most of
3404.08s: you, I think, are have your hearts in
3406.00s: the right place and are willing to at
3407.20s: least at the very least hear out what
3409.60s: people have to say without judgment. And
3411.52s: I think that suspension of judgment goes
3414.40s: a long way with people who've
3415.76s: experienced things. And so yeah, I'll
3419.68s: leave it at that. Thank you so much for
3421.60s: watching. Thank you for listening. And
3424.16s: folks, I will be at contact in the
3426.32s: desert. I didn't want to film anything
3428.32s: over there cuz I kind of wanted to let
3429.76s: loose and just kind of like hang out and
3431.44s: meet people, which is what I'll be
3432.96s: doing. But I'll also bring my camera in
3434.72s: case. And I might just film a little
3436.96s: something for you guys cuz I have
3438.24s: nothing planned for the week that I get
3439.60s: back. As you know, I I film and edit all
3441.52s: of these videos myself. And uh I might
3443.92s: not have time to do that. So I might
3445.36s: just put something together about uh my
3447.20s: experience over there or perhaps some
3448.80s: interview. I don't know yet, but stay
3450.64s: tuned for that. That'll be next week.
3452.32s: And uh and then in the month of June,
3454.64s: we're going to have some more guests
3455.92s: come back into the skiff, which I'm
3457.28s: really excited about as well. So thank
3458.96s: you for tuning in. I appreciate you. I
3460.56s: hope you guys have a lovely weekend and
3461.92s: we'll see you on the next video. Peace
3463.44s: and love.
