0.40s: I've seen them in a shop stealing things
3.68s: while controlling the minds of all the
5.84s: other people in the
8.84s: shop. All of a sudden, a man, a
13.04s: ridiculously disguised gray, and this
15.84s: gigantic little boy show up. What is
18.80s: going on here? Then the gray and the
21.28s: giant little boy start playing patty
23.52s: cake. and they start playing patty kick
25.36s: and their hands start to move so fast
26.96s: it's making like a you can't see their
30.16s: hands. A crowd gathers. I mean, we're in
32.16s: an airport at the baggage claim area.
33.84s: It's not secret. And people are watching
36.96s: this and you know they're all clapping
39.04s: and and the little boy sort of bops a
41.28s: couple of times and turns and walks
42.80s: toward the wall and suddenly he's just
44.88s: gone. And the guy beside me says, "Did
47.04s: you see that?" I said, "Yeah, I think
50.08s: they want companions, as I say, but
51.92s: they'll take slaves if they don't get
53.44s: companions. I know them too well." What
55.36s: does that mean? They'll take soul
57.28s: slaves. They means they'll take over
58.72s: your soul. You for certain it was not a
61.36s: human being. How did you know?
63.60s: Uh, I can't get into that, but suffice
65.84s: to say, it was in a it was in a
68.56s: situation with a
70.44s: uh uh it it was in a situation
75.80s: where I I was once involved in this uh
81.12s: with some people from the defense
83.28s: department. He was a um a Nordic. Was
86.64s: there anything particular about this
88.40s: being that
91.00s: felt unhuman? His
95.40s: eyes. On
97.40s: occasion, people have come into close
100.24s: into physical contact with the grays
103.56s: after meeting me. Maybe it'll happen to
107.64s: you. What's the end look
110.44s: like? You have to look at yourself. It's
114.08s: you becoming
115.56s: self-aware.
118.12s: You
128.36s: Chris. Hey, my name's Jose. Uh, back in
131.28s: 2013, I just got off work around 10 p.m.
134.00s: until I got to this stop sign. There was
135.84s: a SUV was stationary, still running. Uh,
139.52s: it was right across from me. Um, the car
142.00s: was empty but still running. Um, I then
144.80s: slowly drove past the car and heard a
147.68s: loud humming noise coming from the east
149.92s: of me, maybe about 50 yards or so. When
152.32s: I looked over, I saw what appeared to be
154.72s: a car-sized object floating in the air,
158.00s: looking at cattle. The object was
160.16s: beautiful. The colors kept changing from
162.64s: purple to red and green and so on. I
165.92s: then drove off, looked up into the sky,
168.72s: and I saw these uh three large spears in
172.80s: the air.
175.60s: All right. Well, we are rolling. Uh
179.28s: ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
181.20s: another episode of Debrief. Here today
184.08s: in the studio, I am joined by none other
187.20s: than the legendary Whitley Striber.
189.92s: Thank you for joining me, Whitley. Um
192.16s: already a legend and yet still so young.
196.88s: Absolutely. I would I would I would
198.80s: consider you a legend uh in this field
201.28s: and definitely an iconic figure. Um
204.24s: author of how many books have you put
206.24s: out like 40? There's um yeah, something
209.04s: like that. It's too many too. Um but uh
212.56s: most recently, I mean, obviously more
214.48s: famously, uh Communion, you know, which
217.28s: which was uh New York Times bestselling
219.92s: book, stayed up there number one spot
221.84s: for like 6 months. um this book here
225.04s: which I have here which I was going to
226.40s: ask you by the way at the end of the
227.68s: podcast if you wouldn't mind signing
228.96s: them. Of course I'll sign them and I'll
230.80s: keep one for myself and then I like to
232.56s: do some giveaways for the audience here
234.16s: so that they can have them as well.
235.92s: Absolutely. Um pro possibly the most
239.16s: recognizable cover in if not the UFO
243.20s: space but like this whole phenomenon
246.56s: space, right? um
248.92s: haunting haunting
251.00s: story, profound
253.52s: um I I think this book obviously
255.68s: resonated with millions of people around
257.84s: the world and especially uh experiencers
260.80s: uh who didn't know how to put words or
264.00s: images onto the things that they were
265.52s: experiencing until this came out. That's
267.36s: right. But then most recently, and this
269.36s: is something I do want to talk about
270.72s: today, is The Fourth Mind. Yeah. The
274.00s: fourth mind. This is a book where you
276.96s: cover um not only the biology and the
280.20s: anatomy of these uh visitors, but also I
284.56s: mean you delve heavily into sort of the
287.84s: the consciousness part of it and and and
289.60s: and the reasoning behind it and I just
292.72s: thought it was an endlessly fascinating
294.64s: read. So I'm really looking forward uh
296.56s: to to talking about that. So Whitley,
298.96s: thank you so much uh for joining me
300.48s: today. Well, it's a pleasure to be here
302.16s: and I I have never been to Montreal
305.20s: before. It's nice to be in Canada, so
307.92s: I'm glad to be here. Well, Canada's glad
310.40s: to have you. And uh I I know I know that
312.64s: you're from LA, so this is bit of a
314.88s: around LA, so this is a bit of a
316.32s: striking difference in terms of uh
318.16s: weather. Yeah, the snow is real. Very
321.52s: surprising. Was that a Was that a
324.16s: conspiracy in LA that No, no. If you see
326.72s: snow in LA, it's going to be in a theme
328.32s: park. I see. Yeah.
331.16s: Um,
334.04s: okay. I have I have some questions here
336.80s: that I mean, I'd love to answer all of
338.88s: these questions, but I also just don't
340.96s: want to be too distracted from this. And
343.84s: I, you know, we've had a brief
345.84s: conversation here and getting to know
347.12s: each other, but that's something I'd
348.24s: like to do uh within the next few hours
349.92s: is just kind of get to know each other.
352.92s: Um, can we start by talking about just
356.48s: communion a little bit? Sure. Perfect.
359.48s: Um it was for me I I only read this
362.88s: recently and uh you know for me that
366.40s: book is is um yeah it's haunting. Uh
370.16s: there's some there's some wonderful
371.52s: things in there but there's some
372.48s: terrifying things in there as well.
375.40s: Um there is a line in the book that
378.96s: stuck with me uh that I've sort of had
381.60s: in my mind ever since reading it and it
383.84s: it it really for me sums up the
386.08s: experience and it was I wish I lived in
388.48s: a prison.
390.80s: You Yeah. Yeah. that I remember that and
395.88s: I I
398.44s: felt after the experience gelled and it
402.64s: took a while because right afterwards I
405.52s: mean I was in no way
409.64s: expecting aliens to show up in my life.
412.64s: I mean I didn't even know they were out
414.00s: there. I'd had experiences a lot of
416.24s: experiences when I was a child but they
418.08s: were so buried by that time. no
422.28s: idea none that this could
425.48s: happen. Eventually, after struggling
429.52s: with it for about six, four to six
432.44s: weeks, I was left
435.72s: facing the fact that it was
438.36s: real.
440.28s: And what that line expresses is that
444.28s: the the
446.60s: the ground came out from under me and I
449.52s: found myself standing in empty space and
452.64s: falling and falling
454.68s: forever. And I thought to myself, this
458.32s: is a fall that has no
460.52s: end. I'm just here. And I that was I I
464.96s: think when I wrote that line, that was
466.56s: what was in my mind.
469.28s: Yeah, it's a scary thought to to wish
471.76s: yourself into a place like that, but a
474.56s: place like that perhaps that provided a
476.56s: little bit of protection as well.
478.24s: Exactly. It prov The idea was it would
480.88s: provide protection because, you know,
484.08s: I'm used to the visitors in my life now
486.16s: and I'm love them dearly. I'm glad
488.80s: they're
489.64s: here. But that was not true then. Then
494.08s: it was
495.08s: like it was really
498.20s: like real monsters who were far smarter
501.68s: than I was. They're not actually far
504.48s: smarter than we are. They that but
506.00s: that's how they appear initially because
507.68s: you don't know what's going on and you
509.60s: know they and they're in complete
510.80s: control of the situation because of
513.20s: abilities that they have. But uh so I I
517.52s: it was overwhelming and and terribly
520.52s: frightening and I thought to myself, how
524.24s: do I get out of this? How do I get out
527.36s: of
529.24s: this? And
531.72s: uh there was no way. I could push it
535.04s: under the rug. I could pretend it didn't
538.16s: happen. I could be pissed off for the
540.88s: rest of my life about what did
543.00s: happen. or I could go for
546.04s: it.
548.12s: And at some time during the writing of
551.00s: communion, I decided I would go for it.
554.56s: I was going to do
556.36s: this. I And I said, Annie says, "Well,
560.32s: what are you going to do?" And I said,
563.28s: "Well, why don't we do this? Why don't
566.32s: we go out in the woods like at 11 at
571.16s: night and back to the place where pretty
574.80s: sure it
576.92s: happened? She says
580.28s: we said, "Yeah, well, of course." She
584.40s: said, "Whitley, it happened to you. I've
587.60s: got a little boy in the sleep in the
590.24s: bedroom in his bedroom. I'm not leaving
592.00s: the house. you do
594.52s: it. And I thought to
597.08s: myself,
598.84s: whoa, I'm kind of alone
601.96s: here, but I did it. I did it
606.28s: anyway. Crazy guy. You know, in this
609.84s: room, we analyze events most people
611.84s: aren't even allowed to talk about. From
613.60s: contacts to encounters and beings that
616.72s: don't fit any known category. You see,
618.96s: we've read the reports and we've spoken
620.72s: to the witnesses. But now, for the first
624.32s: time ever, we can recreate what it is
626.32s: they saw. Art List's new AI video and
628.64s: image generator lets us do more than
630.48s: just imagine. We can build the moment,
632.72s: visualize the entity, and reconstruct
635.20s: the encounter. Take this encounter for
637.36s: example. In 1965, a French farmer
640.16s: noticed two gray beings in green
641.76s: jumpsuits beside their craft in one of
643.52s: his lavender fields. Within seconds, the
646.72s: AI gives you a visual. Sometimes, it's
650.48s: disturbingly close to what the witnesses
652.24s: remember. And from there, we take it
655.20s: even further. Sound, motion,
658.76s: atmosphere. Art List gives us the full
661.12s: tool set from footage to sound effects,
663.84s: voiceovers, and music. Everything to
666.32s: bring an encounter out of the shadows.
668.40s: This isn't sci-fi anymore. It's
670.08s: investigative reconstruction. And for
672.08s: some of these cases, it's the closest
674.08s: thing we'll have to real evidence. So go
676.00s: to Art List today or click the link in
677.76s: my description to try it out for
679.04s: yourself. Artless AI, built for
681.76s: creators, used by investigators. Yeah. I
686.24s: mean, it I mean, it takes a it takes a
690.00s: special kind of drive to be able to do
692.48s: something like that or to be able to
694.16s: face this head on. It's a special kind
696.40s: of craziness. I don't want to don't
698.00s: think of me as a hero. I was too scared
700.40s: to do it and too scared not to do it. I
703.44s: had to I had to face my fear because I
707.60s: couldn't live with it. And that helped
709.76s: you over overcome it uh to a certain
711.60s: extent. I didn't overcome it. I got used
714.00s: to it. There's a huge difference. Yeah.
716.80s: And uh I I
720.20s: uh just recently a lady
724.36s: who had a close encounter
727.96s: uh had an experience where they did
731.20s: something to her to make her fear go
732.80s: away. She sent me an email about this
735.12s: and I thought, "Boy, I wish they'd done
736.64s: that to me." So interesting. Have you
741.28s: ever thought of um because obviously you
743.68s: know through these hypnotic regression
746.08s: sessions that you've had um
749.32s: to sort of recollect a lot of these
752.24s: experiences. Have you ever thought of
754.08s: using those same techniques to maybe
756.00s: attenuate some of the fear
758.04s: or I don't want to attenuate the fear?
761.28s: And you know the whole issue of hypnosis
763.44s: was a huge one in my life because even
767.12s: though at the time I would you know
769.44s: because I'd been a writer I had I had
771.60s: brushed up against hypnosis once or
773.36s: twice as a not something I'd never done
775.84s: but as something uh that interested me
778.24s: enough to read about it. And uh uh the
782.64s: problem with hypnosis is when you're in
785.52s: hypno a state of hypnosis, you're
788.40s: unconsciously attempting to please the
790.96s: hypnotist.
792.56s: And I I I was initially very concerned
795.20s: about that because uh Bud Hopkins, who
799.20s: very kindly took me under his wing, uh
804.00s: uh wanted to hypnotize me, but he wasn't
807.28s: a professional hypnotist.
809.68s: So I said to him, "Uh, no, I I'm not
812.72s: going to do that." And he said, 'Well,
814.24s: what if I got
815.64s: you someone who's very practiced?' I
818.32s: said, 'Well, yeah, then I would. He
820.40s: calls me a few days later and he says,
821.84s: "Well, I've got Dr. Donald Quiet." And I
824.72s: look him up. He's the head of the New
828.16s: York State Department of Psychiatry, the
830.00s: top guy in psychiatry in New York. And
832.80s: not only that, he's a world famous
835.52s: forensic hypnotist who's found all kinds
838.84s: of solved crimes and done all kinds of
841.60s: things with this forensic hypnosis. In
844.32s: other words, Bud had gotten me the best
846.72s: in the world. And I thought to myself, I
850.00s: can't say no to this because if anyone
852.80s: can do this right, it's this guy. And
855.92s: that's where the hypnosis from communion
858.24s: came from. And I really never I tried it
860.56s: with Bud later, but I was so paranoid
863.12s: about it not working that it didn't
864.64s: work. Yeah. So, that's part of that's
867.20s: part of the um you know, that's part of
869.44s: hypnosis as well. As as a magician
871.28s: myself, I've practiced uh hypnosis for
874.00s: entertainment, you know, purposes
876.24s: quickly understood the immense power
880.00s: that it holds. Yes. You know, and for
882.48s: anyone thinking, well, hypnosis is
885.36s: subjective and and and and and all this,
887.84s: you know, I've I've done it myself.
891.12s: You're right. I've I've I've seen people
894.40s: who are completely familiar with these
897.04s: other with their friends and then their
899.12s: friends suddenly forget words or their
902.00s: feet are stuck to the ground. Like
903.28s: suggestion is incredibly powerful. And
905.56s: so once you start understanding the the
908.80s: how deep hypnosis goes into the
910.96s: subconscious
912.48s: and how much suggestion can dictate our
916.84s: reality then you can understand both the
919.68s: pros and cons of hypnosis that yes
921.52s: suggestion can be implanted right but at
924.48s: the same time you can use it to unlock
927.28s: you know a lot of very deep and
928.80s: otherwise hidden memories. That's
930.72s: exactly right and Dr. point knew just
933.12s: how to do that correctly. Yeah, he was
936.00s: very good at it. And you know, both of
937.76s: us, we started out laughing at Bud
940.24s: behind his back. I mean, we were saying,
941.92s: you know, he's going to come in with his
943.44s: tape recorder. He's so sure it's aliens
946.44s: and Dr. Klein thought it was a crime
949.12s: that I'd been assaulted and so did I. At
952.48s: that point, I had not I had no we did I
956.72s: had the big black eyes and all that
958.80s: stuff in my head, but Bud had been
960.32s: really careful to shield me from any
962.80s: awareness of any of that. So that I did
966.32s: didn't you know I still was thinking
967.92s: it's a crime and he had uh we I'd gone
971.20s: to him simply because of the fact that
974.32s: uh I had read in this book by Jenny
976.24s: Randles science and the UFOs that
980.28s: uh part of it was a story that sounded
984.56s: like what happened to me only it was
986.08s: about alien abduction and Bud's name was
988.88s: mentioned. So I said to myself, well,
992.16s: I'll explore this avenue
994.20s: because, you know, I'm I'm not going to
996.24s: just I'm not going to leave any stone
997.92s: unturned here. And Ann and I went and
1000.40s: met him and he was very sweet and very
1002.80s: con kind and very convinced that this
1005.84s: was real. And we basically left the
1008.80s: house thinking, you know, he's a nice
1011.28s: guy, but uh he's he's definitely gotten
1016.80s: somehow mixed up about reality. Well,
1018.96s: misguided. Yeah. Not even. Yeah,
1021.56s: exactly. But then he calls me up. He
1024.08s: wants to talk again. We go back over. He
1026.16s: wants to hypnotize me. He's all excited.
1028.64s: And that's when it led to Dr. Klein. And
1030.72s: all of a sudden things changed because
1033.60s: Dr. Klein said to me,
1035.48s: "Whley, this happened to you." He said
1038.88s: it just like that. And anyone that
1041.20s: talked to him, even privately, uh, and I
1044.88s: people, a reporter from the New York
1047.20s: Times was going to write a big story
1048.64s: about it that didn't because Dr. Klein
1052.00s: said it really happened to him. I'm
1054.40s: standing by that and therefore the story
1056.72s: didn't appear in the New York Times
1058.16s: because the New York Times only had one
1060.40s: viewpoint. It It's all a big laugh. So,
1064.88s: uh, they didn't publish the story. They
1066.96s: they they spiked it instead. Wow. Oh,
1070.08s: that's the media's the the intellectual
1074.08s: world is having a lot of trouble with
1076.40s: this because they feel I mean, I did
1080.48s: too. I I am an intellectual, I think. I
1083.52s: mean, maybe my wife wouldn't agree with
1086.40s: that, I'm sure, but nevertheless, no,
1088.64s: I'm kidding. She would, but
1092.44s: uh you feel like we're at the top of the
1095.52s: food chain. Our scientists and
1097.12s: intellectual, we know the best things
1099.44s: there are to know. And now suddenly
1102.48s: someone comes along who's f farther up
1104.96s: on the food chain. And not only that,
1107.60s: they don't want to talk to us. They just
1110.64s: want to talk to the hoy paloy. I'm
1113.36s: sorry, but Mr. New York Times reporter,
1117.12s: he ain't going to like that and ain't
1118.80s: going to buy into that. And so it's
1120.80s: hard. It's still very hard for most
1122.80s: people in the sciences and the academy
1125.36s: and in the intellectual community to get
1127.92s: their heads around this. Yeah. And it's
1129.76s: it's one of those things of uh you know
1131.44s: constant shifting goalposts and where
1135.28s: the soft sciences it seems um you know
1138.64s: there's that push to get a lot of the
1140.40s: the respected quote unquote names in the
1142.80s: soft science uh community to acknowledge
1145.76s: this but then once they do then it's to
1148.48s: even bring it into the hard science.
1150.24s: Like there's all these different hurdles
1152.00s: that one has to go through to even just
1154.80s: be you know able to be
1157.80s: um
1159.44s: shared on one of these platforms like uh
1161.44s: like the media. But that's I mean that's
1163.60s: the lovely part about what we're doing
1164.96s: here today. You know that uh who who
1167.52s: needs the New York Times? Well, actually
1170.00s: we do need our intellectual community
1171.92s: and our science scientists to be to get
1177.64s: over what they are experiencing which is
1180.64s: a form of onlogical shock. The shock of
1183.68s: the new. Yeah. Yeah. And they listen,
1185.76s: they are all in it. And even Jake Barber
1188.16s: is in it without knowing it. Jake Barber
1190.08s: is of course the guy who uh has been out
1193.52s: recently on Insider. He's he's engaged
1197.20s: in various ways with this with the with
1199.20s: the phenomenon. Yeah. On the secret
1202.00s: side. So he says, "What do you make of
1203.60s: that?" One of the things Jake Barber
1206.12s: said was that he had experienced being
1211.48s: possessed by a
1214.36s: very what felt to him like a very sacred
1217.36s: feminine presence. And he then
1220.76s: said, "I didn't I don't feel shock. I
1224.64s: feel analological
1226.44s: relief." And Jake was engaged in
1230.32s: aggressive actions toward the visitors.
1233.20s: I know them well. I've been with them ye
1236.16s: for years now. He was not possessed by
1239.72s: any beautiful alien feminine presence.
1244.48s: He was addressed by a weapon
1248.52s: which changed his attitude from an
1252.56s: aggressive attitude to a compliant
1255.08s: attitude. Their weapons don't
1257.12s: necessarily hurt you physically. They
1260.56s: alter your perceptions of them in such a
1265.68s: way that you can
1268.20s: be much more malleable and much more
1271.52s: controllable, but also much more present
1274.80s: to the reality of them, which is that
1277.76s: they they're not aggressive here.
1279.92s: They're not trying to take over. It's
1281.60s: the last thing they want to do. They're
1283.52s: here looking for companionship. If they
1286.16s: wanted to take over, they could have
1287.52s: done that in 10 minutes years and years
1290.28s: ago. But the problem they have is how do
1294.68s: they expose themselves to us as they are
1299.76s: and still enable us to maintain our own
1304.16s: sense of value. Uh the problem the the
1309.04s: issue is cultural colonization. It's
1311.52s: called like when the Europeans went out
1315.12s: during uh the 17th, 18th and 19th
1319.64s: centuries into the rest of the world
1322.64s: possessing higher level technology on
1325.12s: all of all sorts. One culture after
1329.24s: another either fell to them or became
1332.48s: completely directed toward them because
1335.36s: you know their pots and pans were made
1337.68s: of pottery. And suddenly here these
1339.84s: people were with fabulous cannons and
1342.56s: rifles and swords and pots and pans made
1345.84s: of metal and ships that could go around
1348.32s: the world. They didn't care about their
1350.16s: stuff anymore. They wanted that. And
1352.72s: this is exactly what's happening right
1354.72s: now when you have uh like the Skywatcher
1358.00s: people going out with their technology
1360.48s: and their psionics trying to draw in and
1363.92s: attract uh EUOS. And I think to myself,
1367.96s: gee, didn't we do that in uh New Guinea
1372.16s: back in World War II when the New Guinea
1375.36s: natives saw the planes landing and they
1378.16s: built their own bamboo planes and their
1380.80s: bamboo refrigerators and walked back and
1383.68s: forth between them making funny noises,
1385.84s: thinking that it sounded like what they
1387.52s: heard the airmen doing, and then open
1389.44s: the bamboo refrigerators hoping for beer
1391.60s: to come out. Uh we're not, you know, we
1395.52s: got to we got to have a bigger picture
1397.60s: here. Wow. We got to step back and you
1400.80s: can't look at this without looking also
1403.68s: at yourself and what you really are. And
1406.96s: so far we're having some trouble doing
1408.64s: that. Yeah. I mean when you put it like
1411.04s: that, it does seem a little bit uh
1412.96s: silly. It is. Yes. uh because you know
1415.68s: we are so technologically it seems like
1418.88s: we are rather inferior and like you said
1422.96s: I think that if the and I think a lot of
1425.12s: people agree with this too that if the
1426.72s: goal was to do some type of takeover I
1430.00s: mean it would be so swift you wouldn't
1431.44s: even see it coming I mean exactly it
1433.60s: would be it would be over in a second
1434.96s: you might not even know it because this
1436.72s: is the other problem
1438.36s: is we live in a soulblind society we are
1443.20s: anesthetized to our second bodies, to
1445.68s: our souls. You're not. I'm not. A lot of
1449.12s: people listening aren't or they wouldn't
1450.96s: be on this even watching this show. But
1453.44s: for the most part, our intellectual
1455.28s: community and our scientists are and in
1457.84s: the intellectual community and the
1459.60s: scientific
1460.76s: cultures that is part of the culture is
1465.28s: to say there is no such thing as that.
1468.56s: It's all the physical and that's it.
1472.84s: And that is that makes you helpless.
1477.28s: That means you have no chance of
1480.40s: engaging with the visitors in a way that
1483.04s: will be meaningful to you and them.
1486.92s: Therefore, they're going to take from
1489.20s: you what they want since you can't give
1492.08s: it to them. Do you think that
1494.76s: the attempts made by these uh by the
1498.08s: Skywatcher team using
1500.92s: psionics? Do you think that the response
1505.36s: to this um you know psionic calling
1509.44s: whatever it is this this summoning or
1510.96s: whatever whatever it is they're doing.
1513.12s: Um, do you think that's genuine or do
1514.96s: you think this is uh more like a prosaic
1517.20s: explanation and that if they wanted to
1518.72s: contact them, it would be in in
1521.20s: different ways or do you think that this
1523.12s: phenomenon, you know, will contact you
1525.28s: physically like with these sightings
1527.12s: that they've had?
1529.20s: So far from what I've seen from their
1531.88s: videos, they have drawn in living beings
1536.00s: that are living in this in the our
1539.60s: atmosphere that we have never recognized
1542.08s: as animals. Uh we don't recognize their
1545.76s: existence because they live in the upper
1547.68s: atmosphere and they're hard to see and
1550.32s: there's no way to detect them because
1552.00s: our radars and so forth will look right
1554.08s: right through them. If you if you draw
1557.52s: their interest, they will come to you.
1560.32s: Uh and that's but then again, I mean,
1564.00s: frankly, who cares about orb tourism?
1566.24s: There's more to it than that to, you
1568.24s: know, a psionics guy from the government
1570.96s: gets an orb in and everybody's very
1573.56s: excited. But I I'm sorry, but there's
1577.72s: more. Uh living with the visitors is a
1582.64s: fundamental change of life. The first
1585.12s: thing you have to there's two things you
1586.80s: have to do. First, you have to recognize
1589.52s: your soul in its humility and its truth.
1593.36s: And you have to re
1595.96s: recognize that
1598.44s: that you
1600.76s: are potentially an equal partner or
1603.84s: they're not going to treat with you.
1606.24s: They will not. They don't want servants.
1609.20s: They don't want supplicants. They want
1613.08s: companions. That is so
1616.12s: interesting. What do they
1619.80s: fear the visitors? They live in with too
1624.24s: much
1625.24s: knowledge. They are first they're alone.
1628.64s: There's essentially one mind there and
1631.52s: it it extends across all kinds of
1635.16s: different forms and has all kinds of
1638.32s: different levels to it. It is like uh
1641.60s: like our minds. has got levels of it
1643.60s: that are internally contradictory. In
1646.16s: other words, that there's parts of it
1647.76s: that are not in agreement with other
1649.92s: parts of it. And that's true of you and
1651.52s: me, too. But it's on a massive scale
1654.60s: here. But one of the reasons it's so
1657.12s: difficult to look into their eyes. It's
1659.60s: like they burn you out is that you're
1663.36s: not looking at the
1665.72s: individual. You're looking at the whole
1667.92s: being that's in those eyes. the whole
1671.52s: being and it is tremendous. It is
1674.36s: ancient and boy does it ever know you
1677.04s: very well. Very well indeed. Is there
1679.84s: some type of gatekeeping
1683.40s: mechanism that like cuz you had
1686.48s: mentioned like there's a few things that
1688.00s: you have to sort of align yourself with
1689.84s: in order to perhaps communicate with uh
1693.20s: the visitors. But is there some type of,
1696.72s: you know, immune response that they have
1700.08s: in their collective consciousness that
1703.32s: gatekeeps people from accessing them? Is
1707.04s: there is there some is there an entity
1708.88s: there? Is there an energy there that
1710.32s: that that prevents this communication
1712.64s: from happening? Is there something you
1714.48s: have to do to get past that threshold?
1716.16s: Like what does that look like? Well,
1717.60s: that's really an interesting question
1719.44s: and I've never heard it stated quite
1721.44s: that way before. I think that there is a
1725.60s: a
1726.84s: barrier that is generated probably by
1730.16s: both sides to an extent in the sense
1733.96s: that they can be afraid of us and they
1737.28s: definitely can be they're very careful
1739.56s: physically and when one of them will
1742.16s: physically come into a context I'm
1744.40s: familiar with it this individual if it's
1747.52s: one of the biological ones that are
1749.20s: about five feet tall will have guards
1752.40s: with
1753.36s: And the guards will be, interestingly
1756.16s: enough, not only guarding them
1758.64s: physically, but also guarding them on
1760.32s: another level because there's more to to
1763.68s: the contact than we can even see. In
1766.80s: other words, there's other levels that
1768.40s: don't want that to happen and there will
1770.96s: be it's a very fraught situation.
1774.96s: So in that sense there's
1777.56s: gatekeeping but it's almost as if it's
1780.40s: part of nature part of the
1783.96s: essential difference. You know the let
1787.44s: me let me cut kind of cut to the chase
1789.44s: with it regard to the difference. They
1792.96s: are a nonvocal species and a nonvocal
1797.04s: world. There's more than one form there
1800.16s: but they universally do not have voice.
1804.56s: Like I heard one of the in so-called
1806.40s: insiders saying, "Oh yeah, they have a
1808.32s: language." Oh no, they do not have a
1810.56s: language. They have neither sirens nor
1814.72s: vocal cords. They cannot speak. They can
1818.16s: make sounds. And as I talk about in the
1820.80s: fourth mind, those sounds are very
1822.32s: powerful. We'll get into that. We'll get
1823.76s: into that later. Yeah. But uh they are a
1827.76s: nonvoiced species. We are voiced. That
1830.88s: means they basically have a single mind
1832.88s: because they're
1833.88s: telepathic. Uh it's a very complex mind
1836.72s: as I said earlier. It's quite complex
1839.52s: and has different levels. It's
1841.36s: contradictory in places. Uh we are
1845.20s: individual minds. So to them this planet
1849.60s: is packed
1851.88s: with billions of completely separate
1855.24s: individuals. M we have voice and we have
1859.20s: limited ability to communicate with each
1861.20s: other. So we're constantly in a state of
1863.40s: turmoil. And they've told me that their
1866.16s: experience is that voiced species don't
1868.40s: last long, but they are incredibly
1871.96s: creative. They're not creative like we
1874.56s: are. They don't there's just only one
1876.96s: mind there. So how creative could it be?
1879.76s: And so yeah, they love us and they want
1882.32s: to be with us, but they don't expect us
1884.48s: to last. Yeah, it's something you don't
1886.48s: really think about very often is this
1888.24s: idea that like if these
1889.80s: extraterrestrials all possess some type
1892.04s: of, you know, I I hate using the term
1894.48s: hive mind because it's not a hive mind.
1896.24s: It's not um but it's a collective
1898.00s: consciousness where they all have access
1899.60s: to, you know, the the greater um you
1903.04s: know, the greater mind, the fourth mind.
1906.28s: Um it's just so interesting to think
1908.88s: that that might be the defining factor.
1912.32s: that might be our uniqueness is just how
1915.60s: we communicate and how we individualize
1918.00s: our own consciousness versus you know
1920.72s: realizing that we're all part of this
1922.24s: this this greater uh scope. So yeah I
1926.24s: mean that is very very interesting and
1928.48s: maybe this is a perfect uh time to segue
1930.48s: into the fourth mind. Um this book was
1935.92s: really interesting because I had done a
1938.00s: deep dive on this channel. A lot of
1939.60s: viewers uh know this. We read through
1942.40s: this um molecular
1945.96s: biologist's report on you know the
1949.20s: autopsy and the and the genetic uh
1952.08s: material and the physiology and even
1955.12s: partially the philosophy of these as he
1958.64s: put it these eboss. Yeah. And it was for
1962.96s: me there was something about it that
1964.92s: resonated true and I think for a lot of
1968.16s: my audience as well. um not only on the
1971.52s: technical jargon which I couldn't even
1973.76s: you know I had to I was I was on my chat
1976.80s: GPT I think half the time just trying to
1978.88s: figure out what the heck he was saying
1980.68s: about the especially you know when it
1983.20s: came to the uh genetic makeup and the
1985.36s: and and and speaking about you know the
1987.60s: um uh I think that the DNA strands were
1991.04s: were made in palendromes and it was just
1993.76s: very very interesting stuff
1996.20s: but they they mention you know the
1999.60s: individual anatomy very specifically.
2003.04s: Yeah. And you know, we can we can start
2005.04s: here with the vocal cords because I
2006.64s: thought that was so interesting. They
2008.96s: have lung sacks like birds, right? And
2012.40s: this diaphragm that allows for like this
2014.48s: high-pitched humming or vibration. It's
2017.60s: It can be low, too. They can change the
2020.00s: pitch. They can change the pitch to low
2021.76s: as well. Yeah. Well, that would make
2023.52s: sense because they also have in their
2025.88s: ear this uh uh their coccia is like
2029.44s: shaped differently inside their ear
2031.36s: which allows which would allow one of
2033.12s: one of the viewers had mentioned this
2034.40s: for lower vibrations. They can hear um a
2037.92s: spectrum of sounds that that we couldn't
2040.48s: hear. So, they can hear infrasound. So
2042.88s: that could essentially they could be
2045.20s: communicating with each other without
2047.12s: moving their lips without making a sound
2050.40s: to our ears and to us it would seem
2053.76s: pretty much identical to telepathy.
2056.56s: Well, interestingly enough, uh, you
2059.68s: know, I've had lots of telepathy with
2062.24s: them and also with people who are, I
2065.84s: think, have been bred by them to have
2068.84s: telepathy because these people are also
2071.20s: unvoiced. And if you go to Kai Dickens's
2074.88s: show, the telepathy tapes, you'll find
2076.64s: that the spellers who are regular people
2079.76s: but who are unvoiced,
2082.44s: uh, have telepathy. And, you know, I
2086.80s: could do telepathy with speakers now
2089.12s: that I know they have it. I had a
2091.68s: wonderful experience with a with a I'm
2094.96s: spellers with a speller in Mexico a few
2097.28s: few weeks ago standing on a street
2099.44s: corner and I could see she was a speller
2102.08s: because she was with her mother and
2103.84s: there was she looked like she may have
2106.24s: not have been a speller but she was
2107.56s: unvoiced and so I interrogated her
2110.52s: telepathically and she immediately
2113.84s: turned around she was really surprised
2115.76s: and I said don't worry don't worry and
2118.24s: then but we tried to do it verbal
2120.32s: telepathy and it she didn't speak
2122.00s: English and I didn't speak Spanish so
2123.44s: that didn't work. So, we did
2126.68s: it visually and she shot me a picture of
2130.88s: her dog and this is how these this
2134.44s: works. A dog, probably her dog, but the
2138.16s: thing was the dog looked just like the
2139.92s: dog I had when I was a little boy. And I
2142.72s: don't know whether that she was giving
2144.24s: me a picture of her dog or saying I'm
2147.12s: really friendly. So, I showed her a
2149.84s: picture of my dog and the two dogs
2152.88s: reacted to each other. That is to say,
2155.52s: we had a friendly experience together.
2158.16s: See how that worked? It's how different
2159.84s: it is from the way we think. And then
2162.24s: the the light changed and they went on
2164.32s: across the street and my bus came and
2165.92s: that was that. How was that? It's so
2168.00s: cool. So fun. Wow. That's interesting.
2170.40s: Yeah. I I because you know often we see
2174.40s: telepathy through the lens of you know
2178.08s: our own anthropomorphization or our own
2180.64s: interpretation of what that would look
2182.56s: like through the human experience. They
2184.24s: think oh telepath must be able to read
2186.00s: my mind right and that's not true. I I'm
2189.60s: not a good telepath. I can't in other
2191.44s: words I cannot turn on telepathy and
2193.84s: read your mind right now. But if you
2196.56s: were a telepath and you interrogated me,
2199.92s: I would hear it immediately.
2202.48s: So, uh, if I wanted to. Yeah. It's
2205.20s: almost like a,
2206.52s: um, you know, I I often I often think of
2209.20s: like if we were to come up with some
2212.08s: type of, you know,
2214.28s: iOS that were to give, you know, give
2217.44s: each other um, access to one another's
2220.16s: minds. there would probably be some
2222.72s: firewalls or some uh notifications that
2225.52s: would happen there prior to the you know
2227.76s: so and so wants to send you a message do
2229.52s: you accept getting back to the
2231.96s: infrasound uh issue it's possible that
2235.20s: there is I'm sure that one of the things
2238.00s: you learn about nature when you're
2239.60s: trying to figure out things that are
2241.92s: happening at the edge of known nature
2243.76s: which is where this happens is that
2246.32s: there it doesn't waste anything
2250.24s: uh you know the principle of least
2251.76s: action in physics uh water will never
2255.52s: stop on its way down the hill to look at
2257.52s: the view. It always takes the the
2259.52s: easiest possible route. That's nature
2262.48s: doesn't do things that it that are
2264.80s: useless.
2266.44s: Uh few things like the manish shrimp's
2269.28s: got a lot of sensors that it doesn't
2271.68s: appear to need, but that's rare. So,
2274.16s: it's maybe true that they have ways of
2277.44s: of communicating with each other and
2281.04s: possibly with us and interrogating us
2284.32s: using infras infrasound that would seem
2287.68s: to us like telepathic communication
2289.68s: because we can't hear infrasound. Yeah.
2292.16s: Charles Hall had also um spoken about
2295.04s: that when he had mentioned the tall
2296.32s: whites uh that they also spoke in these
2300.32s: tones that you just could not hear and
2302.80s: and it would it would seem to it would
2304.80s: look identical to telepathy. Well, I had
2307.84s: one experience in my life with the tall
2310.28s: whites that really annoyed my wife and
2312.96s: I'll I'll tell you the story if you want
2314.80s: me to. Absolutely. Okay, here's a
2317.20s: situation. It's in the middle of the
2318.96s: communion tour. I'm going out and
2321.28s: getting beat up as the rectal probe man
2323.60s: and being asked like, "What about your
2325.48s: anus?" you know, and stuff uh like that
2329.36s: endlessly. And yes, I'm pretty tired of
2331.60s: it as you can imagine. And fortunately,
2334.48s: people didn't care. They were interested
2335.84s: in the book, not in the which
2337.92s: was nice. Uh in any
2341.56s: case, I wake up because my head I'm not
2345.52s: in my bed. I'm clearly on the couch in
2347.68s: the living room and I'm thinking, did I
2349.68s: go to sleep on the couch? I open my eyes
2352.08s: and looming up above me is this
2354.16s: enormously tall woman looking down at me
2356.56s: and a man behind her looking over her
2359.68s: and he's so tall he's like having
2362.32s: problems with the ceiling and she has a
2366.08s: little thing in her hand and she goes
2369.20s: makes a sound very high sound pitch
2372.92s: sound and then I at that moment hear
2376.80s: them say and I thought they were talking
2378.64s: but I I would assume it had something to
2380.80s: do with the sound and stuff I don't
2383.12s: understand or didn't then what can we do
2386.32s: to help
2388.44s: you and I blurted out and since you've
2392.00s: talked to Charles Hall you know why I
2394.48s: did this I did not know it at the time
2396.88s: you could show me one of your
2399.40s: children and the next morning I told an
2402.80s: the story and she goes
2405.56s: what I said I just bloated it out I
2409.20s: don't know Why? She said, "Quittley, I'd
2412.16s: like to hit you over the head with a
2414.84s: book."
2416.36s: And I said, "Well, wait a minute." She
2418.80s: said, "You could have asked for a UFO.
2421.12s: You could have asked for anything. And
2423.68s: you asked for that. Who
2426.68s: cares?" Well, it turns out they do care
2430.08s: very
2430.92s: much. And I did not know that I was
2434.16s: asking for their trust at the time. I
2436.72s: didn't understand that.
2438.24s: deep inside myself. I knew that. And I
2441.20s: was not asking just for me. I was
2442.80s: probably asking for this whole species.
2444.88s: Will you trust us?
2447.80s: So weeks pass. I'm end I end up in at
2452.72s: Stapleton airport in
2455.16s: Denver and I'm waiting for my ride. I'm
2458.48s: at the baggage claim waiting for my ride
2460.24s: to pick me up to do author tour in
2461.84s: Denver.
2463.64s: And all of a sudden, a
2467.40s: man, a ridiculously disguised gray, who
2471.68s: looks like at best sits wearing
2474.48s: morticians wax and a cheap dress. And
2478.08s: you know, you know, they can they're
2479.76s: they're so in control of our minds. They
2481.68s: can it's not hard for them to walk among
2483.44s: us. You'd be amazed. Anyway, and this
2487.28s: gigantic little boy show up. I mean, he
2490.24s: looks like a little boy even though he's
2491.92s: like five feet tall. And they they come
2495.52s: in front of me. They're carrying these
2497.04s: anemic golf bags, like golf bags that
2500.00s: are 50 years old and were never very
2501.76s: good in the first place. And I'm
2503.36s: thinking, what the hell is this about?
2505.68s: And then I realize that, well, that
2507.04s: looks like a gray. And then I see the
2509.68s: guy, and I know the guy, and I think, oh
2512.40s: my god, what is going on here?
2516.48s: Then the gray and the giant little boy
2519.04s: start playing patty cake. And they start
2521.92s: playing patty cake and their hands start
2523.36s: to move so fast it's making like a you
2526.88s: can't see their hands. A crowd gathers.
2528.88s: I mean we're in an airport at the
2530.24s: baggage claim area. It's not secret. And
2533.28s: people are watching this and you know
2535.44s: they're clapping and going on and then
2537.60s: the the the stops and the little boy
2541.28s: sort of bops a couple of times and turns
2543.28s: and walks toward the wall and suddenly
2545.44s: he's just gone and everybody's looking
2547.68s: at each other. I look over the man and
2549.84s: the gray are gone too. And the guy
2552.08s: beside me says, "Did you see that?" I
2554.80s: said, "Yeah,
2556.72s: uh, I did." And he said, "Listen, let's
2559.12s: go to the bar." At that moment, my ride
2561.84s: shows up. I get my stuff. We go to the
2565.36s: car. I'm driving out of Stapleton
2568.20s: airport
2570.28s: and I realize they showed me one of
2573.68s: their
2574.52s: children. That was the boy, the giant
2578.08s: little boy. Wow. Meaning that the answer
2582.32s: was yes. We will trust you. We will
2585.60s: trust mankind.
2593.88s: That's that would drive me insane. Why?
2597.60s: I because I would be questioning what is
2601.76s: reality like am you cuz you you you
2605.36s: experienced this initially. Yeah. you
2608.16s: had this question of whether or not
2611.36s: there was something wrong with you
2613.44s: because I think that's the path of least
2615.84s: resistance. Yeah. To you know
2617.36s: pre-ontlogical shock to think oh I mean
2621.60s: if this is me then this is all
2623.44s: explainable. Well yeah that's what I
2625.52s: went went to first. Yeah. And so after
2628.16s: going through that now I mean you're
2631.04s: you're forced to believe that this is
2632.72s: reality. I mean that's just Yeah. But by
2635.76s: that by that time I was kind of skating
2639.28s: along that. Now I'm comfortable with it.
2642.40s: That's why then I couldn't have told you
2645.84s: the meaning of that experience that it
2648.56s: was about trust. Now I can understand
2650.88s: that. It's like uh you know I I wrote
2654.64s: this published this book Ann and I did
2656.72s: years ago called the communion letters
2658.96s: which has got a lot of letters in it and
2660.96s: an analysis of the letters. But recently
2664.40s: I published another book called them
2666.80s: which has got 11 of the letters analyzed
2669.68s: the way I know now based on the
2672.24s: knowledge I have now much more deeply
2675.60s: much more clearly. And it's the same
2677.92s: with that experience. I have a much
2680.64s: deeper more clear understanding of what
2682.80s: was really going on. And like the man
2685.36s: that was there I don't talk about him
2686.80s: much. Uh he's passed on now, but he was
2690.08s: very deeply involved in this quite
2692.48s: honestly with the defense department.
2694.32s: Wow. And uh by the time I was seeing him
2699.36s: in the I had already had a couple of
2701.20s: contacts with him prior to that. So I
2704.48s: was uh comfortable in a way that I
2707.12s: hadn't been before. In other words, I
2709.12s: was no longer kind of uh at sea with
2712.64s: this. I had the the uh fact that that he
2717.68s: and Dr. David W. Webb who I can talk
2720.48s: about had both been very frank with me
2723.60s: about the fact that I was engaged in a
2725.84s: real
2726.76s: experience. So I I had some anchor some
2729.76s: grounding at that point which is I think
2733.28s: vital. Yeah. For your own you know your
2736.08s: own um sanity. Absolutely. And and they
2739.20s: came forward because of that and they've
2740.92s: been like Dr. Web. People always hate
2743.60s: the government, but Dr. Webb was deeply
2746.00s: involved in this. If you look at David
2748.56s: W. We web Webb up on Wikipedia, if they
2750.96s: don't take it down because I'm talking
2752.48s: about him, uh you will see that he was a
2754.72s: space scientist and he was uh involved
2757.04s: with every alphabet agency there was,
2758.80s: which he told us at the time. And he he
2761.84s: introduced me to an allergist who gave
2763.68s: me allergy medications so I wouldn't get
2765.52s: allergic reactions when the grays were
2767.12s: around. In other words, they knew
2768.64s: perfectly well what was going on. And he
2771.44s: was extremely encouraging. He said,
2773.04s: "Whitley, go for it. Do your best. Do
2776.16s: your
2781.08s: best." Do you
2783.48s: think Do you think there's they're still
2786.24s: learning the government? No. Oh, the
2788.56s: grays. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They wouldn't be
2791.44s: here if they weren't interested in us.
2793.36s: So, they're they're learning from us.
2795.36s: This is a cornucopia. Every single one
2798.16s: of us is different. Every single one of
2801.12s: us is different. So when they engage
2805.36s: with a human being, they're engaging
2807.68s: every time with a new person. And there
2810.24s: are obvious parameters, limitations and
2813.32s: parameters that you know we have
2815.36s: limitations like you know we have a
2816.80s: limited amount of intelligence and so do
2818.80s: they. Uh but they are essentially one
2823.80s: mind. It's a very complex mind as we
2827.76s: talked about earlier but it's one mind.
2830.96s: Now suddenly here they are in this
2833.04s: beautiful verdant planet full of all
2837.04s: kinds of minds and not just human minds.
2839.84s: There's all sorts of minds here. As far
2842.32s: as I understand from them, the plant
2845.20s: world has very
2847.80s: complex consciousness that the planet is
2851.60s: like a like a the most incredible
2856.40s: brilliant Renaissance painting of
2858.48s: consciousness you can imagine. It's the
2861.36s: it's a super conscious, incredibly
2863.76s: sacred place with these doofuses
2867.12s: screwing around with it. And we're the
2869.40s: doofuses. And you know, they have a
2873.12s: sense of humor. It's a little dark,
2875.04s: admittedly, but they do have a sense of
2876.88s: humor. And they do not want us to die
2879.36s: because we're so much fun. Frankly,
2881.28s: we're tremendously entertaining to them
2883.92s: and tremendously valuable. And and you
2886.80s: know I what my great fear is that if
2891.52s: they think that we're going to kill
2894.64s: ourselves off which they've already told
2897.36s: me the voiced species are very
2899.44s: vulnerable to
2901.24s: self-destruction. Uh they might
2904.44s: intervene and if they do intervene
2907.52s: they're not going to be happy about it.
2910.00s: The reason being that as soon as they
2913.40s: intervene, cultural colonization happens
2916.56s: and we redirect all of our interests
2918.88s: toward them, right? That's what Sky
2920.88s: Watcher is about and why it makes me
2922.72s: kind of nervous because they're
2924.96s: obviously out there spending a lot of
2927.28s: money trying to get technology from
2929.04s: them, right? you know, and that was just
2931.92s: not effective in New Guinea and it's not
2933.68s: going to be effective here either
2934.88s: because it's they're we're we're here in
2937.92s: terms of technology and they're like
2939.36s: here and you know they come down to here
2942.80s: so we can see them and then we go up and
2945.28s: we think we're there but then they're
2947.36s: here again. Yeah. Technology that we're
2950.16s: not quite ready for. It's not technology
2953.20s: is the reason like I I always say to
2955.36s: these people I've said to them for years
2957.44s: when you look at the materials please
2959.28s: understand they are looking back at you
2961.76s: but they don't understand that they
2964.16s: think like I was talking just some some
2966.32s: friends the other day about this and
2969.04s: they were looking at it entirely in
2971.04s: terms of they can't get their minds
2973.20s: around the fact that the these beings
2975.76s: are their technology like my uncle when
2979.20s: he stuck his head in a UFO
2982.16s: at at at or the remains of one I should
2985.12s: say at Wright Pat. This is my uncle
2987.60s: Mickey was a Air Force intelligence
2989.68s: officer and he was at right field when
2993.12s: the debris was brought brought in and in
2995.60s: the air material command. The Roswell
2997.60s: stuff. Yeah, the Roswell debris under uh
3000.80s: General Twining as was his friend Art
3003.60s: Exon who later became commanding officer
3005.60s: at Wright Pat. And they both talked to
3007.68s: me about this after I published
3008.96s: Communion apparently being given
3011.04s: permission to do so. Uh because it was
3013.60s: very classified then as still is but
3016.72s: they didn't tell me to keep it secret
3018.24s: and obviously I'm not intended to do
3020.24s: that. In any case, he said it had
3022.56s: nothing in it except balsa wood struts
3025.84s: or he may he may not have said the balsa
3028.32s: wood struts. He may have just said it
3030.08s: had nothing in it. In other words, we
3032.00s: couldn't find a motor was I think his
3034.00s: exact words. We couldn't find a motor.
3036.72s: And when you look at the
3038.92s: grays, the the small uh android type
3043.12s: grays, the three-foot tall ones, they're
3045.68s: bones are filled with copper instead of
3047.52s: bone marrow, and they're part of the
3049.68s: technology clearly. Mhm. They're part of
3052.16s: the ship. That was mentioned by the Ebo
3054.80s: um biologists as well, right? I think
3057.92s: so. I think he'd mentioned that as well
3059.52s: that that there's a heavy heavy um
3062.88s: copper. Oh, yeah. That's where I got
3065.04s: that. I got that from his document. I
3066.88s: did not I've never experienced that
3068.32s: directly. Let me be clear about that.
3070.16s: But that's uh I mean it's so interesting
3071.92s: because there are other documents that
3073.44s: also talk about copper being a really
3075.92s: important uh piece of all of this. Yeah.
3079.12s: And and like I explained in the fourth
3081.72s: mind, you know, the cattle mutilations
3084.88s: are so mysterious, but they're actually
3087.20s: not mysterious because the blood of
3089.36s: cattle is full of copper. Yeah. And
3091.28s: they're using that as food. They're
3093.68s: using the same food source we use and
3096.08s: we're upset about it and they probably
3097.68s: don't even realize that. I think they've
3100.00s: used humans as a food source from time
3101.68s: to time, too. But I don't think they do
3104.40s: do that. I think they figured out that,
3106.40s: you
3108.28s: know, either the ones that were doing
3110.56s: that shouldn't have been doing it or
3113.52s: they they didn't understand what we
3116.48s: were.
3118.00s: So there's this other thing that uh it
3121.76s: mentions uh about a film over their eyes
3124.56s: and and the cover you know obviously the
3126.56s: cover of communion features the uh the
3130.24s: film right which is over their eyes but
3132.08s: then the new fourth mind cover you sort
3134.56s: of have the the veil that's on their
3137.20s: eyeballs lifted. Well, you know, I have
3141.36s: maybe glimpsed that. It's mentioned
3143.52s: specifically in the Reddit document and
3146.24s: a friend of mine who is a deep
3148.32s: experiencer called Steve Neil, uh, who's
3152.32s: also a wonderful artist, and you look up
3154.64s: Steve Neil on the internet and you'll
3156.32s: find some cool stuff. Anyway, he's seen
3160.24s: them, he says, without the eye covering
3162.48s: very clearly. And I when he said that I
3165.76s: had a vague memory of maybe seeing it
3167.92s: myself and then I read it in the Reddit
3170.32s: document and I think I thought this is
3173.28s: maybe the next step
3176.28s: because without the eye
3178.92s: covering see the thing is when you look
3181.84s: at them when I look at you I'm looking
3184.72s: at a guy I look into your eyes and I see
3188.96s: a lot of things but when you're looking
3191.68s: at grace You're not looking at a guy.
3195.84s: You're looking at an entire being that
3199.44s: not only is huge, but also ancient and
3203.04s: bigger than you and knows you really
3206.12s: well. And that is appalling.
3210.20s: So that's with the eye coverings on.
3213.60s: With the eye coverings off, it must be
3216.40s: wo. So, you think the covering isn't
3220.40s: just for um you know, their sensitivity
3224.16s: to light? You think that it might be
3226.88s: more to mask a little bit of that shock
3229.84s: that we might feel? Yeah, I think it
3231.44s: might blow us up. Yeah, I think we
3234.16s: might. It might blow us up. That' just
3236.08s: be too much.
3238.16s: I'd love to see if I could do it to see
3240.88s: their eyes. Yeah, I they've been around
3243.12s: some friends recently and uh physically
3246.48s: and uh really Oh, yeah. That's not
3249.20s: unusual in my life. How could it be? I
3251.20s: know so many people are in contact and
3254.08s: but with the eye coverings. And I was
3256.32s: thinking to myself, I was thinking,
3259.28s: guys,
3262.92s: uh come do it without the eye coverings
3265.92s: if they're real. We'd like to see that.
3269.32s: Uh so maybe it'll happen. Is that how
3272.56s: you communicate is just that simply just
3274.72s: by thinking? Yeah, that's one way.
3276.88s: That's one way. And then through the
3278.00s: meditations is another way. Yeah. Yeah.
3279.84s: Well, I I do the sensing exercise where
3282.72s: you take your attention to your body and
3285.88s: uh
3287.40s: uh
3289.00s: you you change then you your mind opens
3292.40s: up a little bit and your body my wife
3295.44s: taught me that you glow when you do
3297.76s: that. in the other level of reality and
3299.52s: you could be seen. And
3302.52s: so you get good at that and you really
3305.52s: can control the degree to which you can
3308.64s: be seen. And uh so that's how to
3311.76s: communicate with it because they will
3312.96s: notice that immediately like a moth to a
3315.28s: flame. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. It's not
3318.56s: that they don't want to be here or they
3320.32s: don't like us. They're here because they
3322.48s: do want to be here and do like us.
3325.68s: Do you think that it is their modus
3328.96s: operandi to sort of have us learn about
3332.08s: them? I think they'd like that. I think
3334.56s: they want companions, as I say, but
3336.40s: they'll take slaves if they don't get
3337.92s: companions. I know them too well. What
3339.84s: does that mean? They'll take soul
3341.76s: slaves. That means they'll take over
3343.20s: your soul.
3345.28s: uh you know, if you're if you're
3347.96s: relentlessly denying the existence of
3350.48s: your own soul and pretending this is all
3353.36s: technology and science as we understand
3355.76s: it and so forth and all of that, they're
3358.32s: eventually going to just say, "Well,
3360.32s: hell, this soul is valuable to us and
3362.48s: we're taking it. We're taking it over
3364.88s: and you won't have communion. you will
3367.12s: become a
3369.08s: uh you will become their
3373.32s: uh I don't know how there's hardly a
3376.00s: word I can think of to explain it
3377.84s: because we have so few words to explain
3380.40s: the life of the soul the the second body
3383.36s: is what I'm talking about which you know
3386.16s: if you've been out of your body you know
3387.60s: what that is and I do yeah yeah exactly
3391.36s: they'll take that and listen it's got so
3394.80s: much in it It's so much in
3398.84s: it. Like I've had a couple of lessons
3402.16s: from them that have opened me to parts
3406.88s: of my soul memory that have been the
3410.48s: most
3412.04s: extraordinary wonderful experiences. Do
3414.72s: you mean like past life? No. No. I No. I
3418.72s: they've never I don't have I have a few
3421.68s: memories of probably past lives in
3424.00s: ancient Rome and maybe one or two
3426.72s: others. Uh
3429.20s: uh but that hasn't been part of it in my
3432.56s: experience very much. Not with them at
3434.24s: all that I'm aware of. But this life,
3438.60s: yes, two things.
3441.84s: one when I they called me to come to be
3445.44s: with them in the woods at the cabin in
3450.36s: 198 I guess or
3452.84s: '89 and and I got scared and wouldn't go
3455.84s: down there when I they were there
3457.52s: physically waiting for me and when I
3460.08s: went back to the house
3462.80s: uh I got
3464.20s: this sense of one of them being
3466.80s: invisible but in the room with me and
3469.28s: the next thing I knew I plunged into
3472.08s: what initially seemed to be an extremely
3474.24s: strange space. I saw these sort of
3478.20s: tapering columns going up and I couldn't
3480.80s: tell where I was. I was kind of gliding
3483.16s: along and then I realized as I looked up
3486.00s: that it was my mother's desk from when I
3488.40s: was a baby in her room. When I was a
3490.88s: baby, she had this desk and I recognized
3493.44s: it. I'm looking at it. I can recognize
3495.28s: it right now in my head as I'm talking.
3497.92s: And I was taken back to the moment when
3500.56s: I first walked and but not as a baby
3505.12s: mind. My adult mind was placed in my
3508.16s: baby body experience so perfectly that I
3512.88s: was like a baby with an adult mind for a
3515.84s: few seconds. And that degree of
3519.92s: knowledge is also why those eyes are so
3523.36s: hard to look at because there's nothing
3526.40s: about you they don't know. And this is
3529.52s: also their problem. This is their great
3532.56s: blessing, their
3534.04s: sacredness, their problem. Why is it
3537.04s: their problem? Because they know so
3539.44s: much. They can never be surprised.
3544.00s: They can't be surprised. It's hard to
3546.60s: fathom that, you know, we're we're so
3549.36s: used to this condition. Yeah. We're so
3551.76s: used to because we're in the opposite
3553.68s: state. We are always surprised. You and
3556.32s: I are sitting here talking and every
3558.96s: second is new. Our minds are working.
3562.56s: For them, this would be like riding on
3565.36s: rails. I think and I this could be my
3568.64s: imagination. And I always like to be
3570.32s: really careful about this stuff because
3571.92s: I'm describing things at the edge of
3574.72s: experience and I have to be very very
3578.56s: aware of that. But I
3582.20s: think they might have taken me down a
3585.20s: path one time of being like them and it
3589.68s: was like riding on rails. My the my
3592.84s: future had no meaning. I had no meaning.
3597.36s: I had no there was no experience. There
3600.00s: was it was just all there already and it
3602.72s: lasted a few seconds and it was just
3604.60s: awful. Another thing that happened like
3607.36s: that didn't happen to me. It happened to
3609.36s: my supernatural co-author and friend
3611.92s: Jeff Krile. Uh uh Jeff is a scholar and
3617.04s: he's the creator of the archives of the
3619.68s: impossible at Rice University and uh he
3624.20s: uh
3626.20s: uh he's really into this and an
3630.00s: extraordinary man. He's he collected got
3632.72s: all the letters that Anne had collected
3634.80s: from everybody who had written us and
3637.12s: they've gotten them archived
3638.48s: professionally there and everything.
3640.00s: He's a wonderful guy. Anyway, we're at
3642.72s: the Eselin Institute. They have these
3644.48s: private conferences at Esselin from time
3647.28s: to time with it. They get a bunch of
3649.36s: people of, you know, and it's the sort
3651.60s: of chapter house rules where you don't
3653.68s: ever talk about it outside. So, I'm not
3655.44s: going to talk about it in detail, but
3658.08s: suffice to say, he wanted to stay in the
3662.00s: room with me because at that time, the
3664.48s: visitors were often showing up
3665.84s: physically in where I was. And they
3669.20s: showed up that night. One of them did
3670.96s: for a very brief time and tapped me on
3673.36s: the shoulder to do the 3:00 a.m.
3675.28s: meditation and which was going on big
3678.56s: time then. And so I did it and went to
3680.40s: bed, back to bed. They showed up for
3682.88s: Jeff a few minutes
3684.20s: later about maybe an hour later and he
3688.16s: described it as this way that he heard
3691.12s: it was like he he heard suddenly the
3694.00s: crashing of glass all around him. And
3697.28s: then he heard his own voice cry out from
3699.68s: within him, "Oh my God." And what was
3702.80s: happening is they drew closer. He was
3705.76s: being drawn out of the stream of time.
3708.72s: We don't want to go there because we're
3711.60s: here having experience. The body is
3715.52s: giving our souls, feeding our souls
3718.20s: experience. Our souls are being enriched
3720.88s: by the experience of life. And if we end
3723.92s: up like them outside of the experience
3727.52s: of life, like fishermen on the shore
3729.76s: instead of the fish in the
3732.12s: water, we are in trouble because we can
3735.84s: no our futures no longer have any power
3738.96s: to surprise us. The energy is gone. And
3742.80s: Jeff felt that. And that's why his soul
3745.84s: cried out from within him, oh my God.
3749.52s: And why he was so frightened. And you
3752.24s: know, I had to learn. It took a long
3754.08s: time to learn that they're they know it,
3757.04s: too. And they're not here to take us out
3760.32s: of the stream of time. They're here to
3762.80s: share our experience in the stream of
3765.04s: time. So, you know, I relax now and I'm
3767.76s: much more comfortable with them because
3768.96s: I know they're not going to do that to
3770.32s: me. They don't want to. They want to do
3772.56s: the opposite. They want to share my
3774.08s: experience with me and I can open myself
3776.88s: to them. It's not hard. That sounds so
3779.48s: bleak to have this.
3783.44s: It's bleak enough to where they would go
3785.44s: across the whole universe looking for
3787.20s: help, right? That I I think it's damn
3789.84s: bleak. Do you
3792.04s: think Do you think that they would also
3796.40s: not only monitor life, but in some
3800.60s: way be responsible for it? They're in a
3804.56s: pickle right now. The pickle is it looks
3807.76s: like we're probably going to
3809.00s: self-destruct. And they've already said
3810.96s: that this happens to voice species. They
3813.68s: don't want us to self-destruct because I
3815.84s: also think that since it happens to
3817.92s: voice species so frequently, we're
3819.92s: probably rare and
3822.92s: valuable. So what do they do? the closer
3826.08s: they come to us, the more we become
3828.72s: aware of them and the more danger there
3831.96s: is that we end up like them that you
3836.40s: know we you know we go to them instead
3838.72s: of them coming to us. So they don't want
3842.68s: to culturally colonize us by showing
3845.96s: themselves. But if they don't show
3847.92s: themselves, we're liable to
3849.20s: self-destruct. So they're really in a
3850.72s: quandry right now. They really are. It's
3852.64s: a catch22 situation. It's a catch22
3855.20s: situation. Yeah.
3857.80s: Um, in this document as well, they talk
3861.76s: about something very profound near the
3864.56s: end of it. Uh, it gets quite
3866.68s: philosophical and you know, you're not
3868.56s: one to shy away from philosophy. No. Um,
3872.48s: they mention this apotheiois, this
3875.12s: critical mass that they are attempting
3879.24s: to what seems like they're attempting to
3881.92s: reach.
3884.12s: Um, I've read another document as well
3887.36s: about another, you know, sort of
3889.84s: whistleblower that had come clean on on
3892.32s: uh one of these forums who had also
3894.88s: mentioned a
3897.32s: similar motive about this apotheiois,
3901.12s: but was indeed to end up, you know, this
3904.56s: is this sounds so far out there, but to
3908.24s: not unlike what you were saying, but to
3909.60s: feed consciousness, to feed the
3911.68s: conscious healed. Yes. Through
3913.84s: experience. That's absolutely right.
3916.16s: That's exactly what we're here for. Like
3918.16s: like we're mining consciousness on a
3920.32s: certain level. Yeah. Well, we're mining
3922.24s: experience in order to feed
3923.72s: consciousness. Let's be really clear
3925.44s: here because that's important. And and
3928.64s: so to what goal? Because it seems like
3933.76s: like what is that? What what what does
3935.68s: that critical mass look like? What does
3937.36s: that endgame look like? What is that
3938.96s: apotheiois? Is it the universe becoming
3942.28s: self-aware?
3943.88s: Like what's the end look like?
3947.60s: You have to look at
3949.00s: yourself. It's you becoming
3951.72s: self-aware.
3954.36s: You,
3958.44s: Chris, that's
3960.28s: it.
3961.96s: Because believe me, if you become
3965.28s: self-aware, really self-aware, and stay
3967.52s: in the time stream, this is the next
3970.24s: step for all of humanity and for them.
3974.16s: That's what they want. They want us to
3977.60s: wake up to
3979.24s: ourselves and still stay in the time
3982.52s: stream and
3983.88s: [Music]
3985.32s: be vividly aware in a way that we are
3988.96s: not. Now there are levels of emotional
3992.08s: experience that we don't
3994.12s: touch that are the levels of real true
3997.88s: being that we people have touched in the
4001.44s: past sometimes a little bit but we all
4005.44s: have to do it and it the only way to do
4008.32s: that is to begin to think of Chris or
4012.72s: Whitley or anyone is not as the person
4018.08s: but as the instrument that the person
4020.56s: the being is using to be in the social
4024.88s: community of the species.
4027.88s: uh there is a level of self of being I
4032.48s: should say outside of the
4035.32s: self then that's what they want us to be
4039.60s: able to take our attention to that level
4042.64s: and when our attention is there looking
4045.76s: at the self as it moves through
4048.20s: time there's room then for them to share
4052.56s: with us and share their own experience
4055.04s: with us and and share our experience
4058.80s: without them overwhelming us or
4061.76s: possessing us or destroying the journey
4065.28s: of the soul. This is communion. My wife
4068.88s: knew it, by the way, from the very
4070.72s: beginning. She titled the book Communion
4072.48s: because she knew this. Now, who the hell
4074.72s: was she? She was just she was a kid from
4077.12s: Ann Arbor, Michigan. No one's special.
4079.76s: And I was a kid from San Antonio, Texas.
4081.68s: No one's special. Yet some kind of
4084.64s: critical mass occurred when we came
4086.24s: together and look at what we made. She
4088.88s: made this. She made the word communion.
4092.56s: Do you think there are Do you think
4094.96s: there are more planets like this one? I
4097.60s: know there are, but I also know that a
4099.68s: lot of them don't last long. A lot of
4101.44s: them don't last. Yeah. Uh-uh. That's
4103.04s: what they said that the voiced planets
4105.68s: with voice species are very rare and
4107.84s: valuable. And the reason is that that
4112.32s: you know and look at our political world
4114.08s: and we're half you know we're uh a
4117.36s: heartbeat away from nuclear annihilation
4119.52s: at any given time our politics are all
4122.56s: completely crazy. It's all divided up
4124.40s: into these different countries. But like
4127.68s: Edgar Mitchell said when you look at it
4129.84s: from above where are the countries?
4132.80s: Yeah. Where is this? Where what are we
4134.64s: doing? I mean I'm in Canada right now. I
4138.08s: was happy to come to Canada because it
4139.84s: seems to be a little bit more peaceful
4141.28s: at the moment than the United States.
4143.28s: And I thought, "Ah, it'll be nice." And
4145.44s: I thought, "I didn't do anything. I just
4147.68s: got in an airplane and got off the
4149.04s: airplane and I'm in the same planet.
4151.36s: This is so crazy."
4154.04s: Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah.
4158.76s: Um, what role does
4161.24s: love play in all this? Because you you
4165.44s: hear about it a lot. You see it a lot.
4167.36s: Um, you know, if you look at old
4168.64s: depictions of angels, angelic beings or
4171.68s: or even Jesus, you know, it's this
4173.84s: emanating beam of love coming from this
4176.32s: beating heart to the center of the this
4178.80s: canvas or whatever. It's always it seems
4181.28s: to be a really important factor or maybe
4184.48s: even a defining difference, you know,
4187.20s: between us and them or or or something
4189.84s: unique about it. But how does it fit in?
4193.52s: An became enlightened toward the end of
4196.00s: her
4196.84s: life. And when I say it, it wasn't like
4202.56s: fireworks in the sky or bells and
4204.60s: whistles. It was a
4207.88s: quiet change in her inner being that I
4211.36s: could feel very
4213.56s: much. And you know, so I I I know Anne
4218.32s: too well to say, "Well, oh, are you
4220.40s: enlightened?"
4222.00s: She would have given me the finger for
4224.44s: sure.
4226.28s: But I asked her, "What is
4228.84s: enlightenment?" And she says to me,
4231.68s: "Enlightenment is what happens when
4233.84s: there is nothing left of us but
4237.08s: love." That's love. That's what it's
4240.04s: about. But what kind of love? We think
4242.80s: always in terms of the kind of
4245.04s: sentimental love that grew up in the
4247.36s: Victorian era and sort of spread with
4249.84s: the discovery of Valentine's Day and
4252.64s: Valentine's cards and kissing and that
4256.00s: kind of love. There's another kind of
4258.44s: love. There's the kind of love that
4260.72s: holds the universe together. Objective
4263.60s: love, the urgency to
4266.36s: be. Touching that
4268.84s: love, it opens your heart in a whole new
4272.92s: way. And then you understand what this
4276.64s: universe is about and where it's going.
4279.36s: And that's where it's
4285.48s: going. How important is it to for the
4288.88s: universe, do you believe, and through
4290.72s: these beings themselves to self-express?
4296.16s: I think it's important for us to
4297.84s: self-express because we can. Because we
4300.16s: can. Yeah. I'm not so sure the grays
4302.32s: really can. Not as individuals. They do
4304.96s: have individual personalities and
4307.92s: personality types, but they're all the
4310.48s: same mind. Like I've never seen a work
4313.28s: of art, heard a bit of
4317.40s: music, anything poetry, anything like
4320.80s: that from them because you know if
4324.08s: you're entirely
4325.72s: alone what where would that come from?
4328.40s: And the answer is there's no it might be
4331.60s: happening to them now by the way as they
4334.16s: engage with us. I have a feeling they
4336.40s: will find their own poetry. I know they
4338.08s: like poetry. I wrote I write poems and
4341.04s: they have enjoyed my poetry at times.
4345.36s: Again, I guess that comes down to the
4347.28s: idea of not being able to be surprised.
4349.92s: You know, when when art hits you a
4352.24s: certain way or a new song hits you a
4353.76s: certain way or a a poem or a movie or an
4356.40s: image, it's it's unexpected and it's
4359.84s: welcomed, but for them it's just
4362.48s: unsurprising. And and if they already
4364.88s: know it's gonna be there, it is. Yeah.
4367.44s: But if they can get in this and be with
4369.76s: us, then they can be surprised by it.
4372.80s: Are they Is that something because now
4374.56s: we're we're going into territory of like
4377.20s: you're familiar obviously with David
4378.48s: Jacobs. Oh, sure. I know. And the the h
4381.12s: Yeah. The hybridization stuff, right? Is
4384.64s: is that something that they're
4387.52s: interested in pursuing as well? like the
4390.72s: this idea that you know they can sort of
4393.84s: you use the human body as containers in
4396.00s: in a certain way to to feel. One of the
4399.04s: things that happens is people always
4401.24s: think oh they must be so far ahead of us
4404.64s: and so far advanced but I as I point out
4408.08s: in the fourth mind a lot of their
4409.92s: genetic work is not all that good and
4413.36s: part of that I think has to do with the
4415.16s: hybrids. They are real period. They are
4419.52s: whether they are hybrids or not or
4421.92s: something else. What they are are human
4425.64s: beings who the males have uh Kleinfelder
4429.92s: syndrome. They are not. In other words,
4431.76s: they reach they don't fully express
4434.32s: puberty and they just grow older but
4436.88s: still look
4438.12s: like like like I said of when I first
4441.68s: saw started to talk about the boy that
4444.24s: lived in our woods behind our house. Uh
4447.20s: he was like an 11year-old but you looked
4449.68s: at him closely and he was weathered and
4452.24s: that was because his he had Kleinfelder
4454.56s: syndrome and hadn't grown he hadn't
4457.12s: become pubescent.
4458.96s: Uh they they are all unvoiced. They
4463.04s: cannot speak. I presume they don't have
4464.96s: vocal cords. Uh they are fluently
4468.16s: telepathic. They are extremely
4471.64s: autistic and they are in trouble
4476.20s: basically. Uh I've seen them in a shop
4479.52s: stealing things while controlling the
4482.08s: minds of all other people in the shop.
4484.80s: And I don't know how they live. I mean
4487.44s: that I do know some of them live very
4490.32s: hand-to-mouth existences. Uh they
4493.60s: they're out in the desert in, you know,
4495.84s: shacks and things. It's not a good life,
4498.40s: I don't think. What proof is there of
4500.16s: these hybrids existing?
4504.12s: Uh in my life, plenty. Is there is there
4507.44s: any um but physical proof that I could
4510.48s: point to? Uh,
4513.72s: I given that they are telepathic and do
4517.12s: not want to be
4518.52s: found, I think it's probably impossible
4521.36s: to find them. Have you ever gotten
4523.12s: confirmation from a government agency
4526.20s: that some type of hybridization program
4529.88s: was happening whether solely from ETSs
4533.92s: or or in conjunction with human beings?
4536.80s: No, I haven't ever inquired at that
4539.28s: level. I I you know my my experience of
4542.96s: the government is very sketchy and iffy.
4546.64s: Uh you know
4548.76s: uh as I said earlier Dr. Webb was very
4553.60s: much helpful and so was the man at at
4557.08s: Stapleton. But the government right now
4560.96s: the people who are coming out are really
4562.96s: wary of me. Uh I've had a couple of
4566.64s: instances
4568.64s: uh where this some kind of mind control
4571.44s: thing I don't know what it is that goes
4573.04s: on uh a couple of years ago a guy says
4576.88s: to me you know I had the weirdest thing
4578.40s: happen Whitley and he was a person who
4580.24s: had been friends of mine friend of mine
4582.64s: and also close to a lot of people in the
4584.72s: government he said I heard this voice in
4586.56s: my head say don't believe Whitley
4588.32s: Whitley is wrong and I thought well you
4591.12s: know he's probably scared and I said
4593.60s: well I wouldn't worry about it because I
4596.48s: think the voice had to some to do with
4598.52s: you. But then oh about a year later
4602.80s: another person says the same thing and
4606.16s: recently two more people have said the
4608.40s: same thing. And so I thought to myself,
4612.28s: whoa, I you know, no wonder so many of
4615.84s: the government people kind of are hands
4618.56s: off of me. I like I these conferences
4621.76s: the soul foundation
4623.48s: conference conferences I'm not allowed
4626.08s: to speak
4627.76s: uh authors of the impossible conference
4630.88s: anyone everyone no no no whitley even
4633.60s: though my my archive is there I could
4637.12s: not speak is that because of some kind
4640.08s: of hidden locomotion or not I don't know
4643.44s: I mean not not I don't mean the
4645.12s: government telling people hey don't let
4647.28s: him speak but something going on in
4649.28s: people's heads that they're not aware
4650.80s: of. You know, it's preventing them from
4654.16s: allowing me to express myself. And all
4657.20s: of the government people who are
4658.80s: involved in this mostly will not talk to
4661.36s: me. Louis Alzando will talk to me, but
4664.00s: not go not not publicly. Uh Jake Barber,
4667.36s: no. David Grush, no. I mean, they just
4670.40s: don't
4671.32s: respond. Uh uh John Jim Lacodsky did
4675.68s: respond and actually went on my show,
4677.92s: but his experiences weren't in the
4680.24s: context of his uh official work. They
4683.92s: were outside of that, you know, and so
4687.36s: it's a very fraught, very complex
4690.36s: situation. And I don't really know if
4693.12s: I'm talking about something that's being
4695.44s: done to them, that I'm talking about
4697.44s: mind control or exactly what I'm talking
4701.04s: about. But I do know this. I know one
4703.76s: hell of a lot about this. And I am
4706.84s: somehow kind of being silenced. Not
4711.32s: here, fortunately. Not on podcast. So
4715.36s: far, everything's still rolling here.
4717.28s: Everything's still rolling here. Yeah.
4719.68s: Not on podcast, but as far as face to
4723.36s: face speaking as, you know, I can go to
4726.40s: contact in the desert, which I'm going
4728.00s: to do this year. I'll be there as well.
4729.68s: Oh, great. We'll be there. certainly see
4731.36s: each other and I think thanks to them
4733.04s: they in part helped uh make this uh
4735.20s: interview possible. So uh oh yeah let's
4737.36s: mention
4738.40s: contact in the desert do not miss it and
4741.52s: I'm just as wild in person as I am on on
4744.24s: the air so you'll enjoy it if you hang
4746.00s: out with me. Yeah it'll be my first um
4748.32s: convention in this space. Uh you're
4750.72s: kidding. No. Yeah. Well you come at a
4752.96s: good time because you know when I first
4754.80s: started in this in this there's a lot of
4756.96s: it was pretty goofy. It's not goofy now.
4759.44s: There are some very very fine people at
4761.92s: that conference. Uh Rich Dolan's going
4764.32s: to be there. Uh uh uh let's see, Linda
4769.04s: Molton How loads of friends. Yep. James
4772.32s: Fox. James Fox is going to be there. U
4775.36s: Chris Bledsoe. Chris is going to be
4777.12s: there. A lot of reputable names in the
4779.20s: end. Yeah. James has just finished an
4781.76s: incredible documentary in Brazil. I
4784.08s: guess I'm not supposed to talk about it,
4785.52s: so I'm not going to say anything except
4786.96s: that it's incredible. Yeah, we know. We
4788.80s: know that he was in Brazil, you know, he
4790.64s: posted about that him. Yeah. And it was
4793.28s: uh I think his efforts to retrieve uh
4796.24s: some some footage or some photos or I
4798.88s: don't know what. Um but hopefully it you
4802.16s: know hopefully it bore fruit and uh and
4804.88s: I think so. Yeah. He can he can share
4806.88s: some interesting things with us u later
4809.04s: this year. Yeah. Um yeah, I mean
4813.56s: okay, where do we uh where do we go from
4816.56s: here? I want to go back to the anatomy a
4818.24s: little bit, okay? Because I'm fascinated
4820.00s: by this because there's something about
4821.04s: the anatomy of these beings that makes
4822.56s: it tangible. You know, it goes from the
4825.44s: non-physical to the physical. And and
4827.52s: it's funny that we mentioned James Fox
4829.44s: here because one of the more prevalent
4831.76s: pieces of information or evidence of
4834.24s: these beings roaming this town in
4836.36s: Virginia was the smell. Yes. The smell
4840.56s: which you've talked about in communion.
4843.36s: this smell of sulfur or burnt cardboard
4846.40s: or or or ammonia. It's like this very
4850.24s: uh distinct potent putrid smell that
4854.32s: engulfed this tiny town that you had
4857.12s: with your interaction that was also
4858.72s: mentioned by this um this molecular
4862.64s: biologist and he actually had the
4866.00s: science behind it. Yes. Which was Yeah.
4868.96s: these pores. Well, that was what start
4872.64s: someone sent me I don't remember who it
4874.56s: was the Reddit piece the document which
4877.52s: is in the back of the book completely
4880.00s: the whole documents there I have no idea
4882.96s: who wrote it. I I I have to admit that
4886.40s: I'm no good at the internet and
4890.12s: uh I didn't find it myself. Someone sent
4893.92s: sent me a link saying this you might be
4896.24s: interested in this and that was true.
4898.40s: The reason it was true is that the first
4900.80s: few words of the document describe
4903.76s: something I have observed but never
4906.48s: spoken about that is really weird which
4910.32s: is that with the pores. Uh the document
4915.48s: describes the fact that they exude waste
4918.56s: through pores in their skin and it
4922.32s: mentions the odor of
4923.96s: ammonia and uh you know they have if
4928.56s: they have aesthetics at all they are
4930.16s: very different from ours. Let's put it
4931.76s: that way. They ain't pretty and I hate
4934.40s: to say that but um and I probably piss
4937.44s: them off but it's the truth. Do you
4939.68s: think so? You think they'd be offended?
4941.52s: I've already done that. Yes is the
4943.52s: answer. U the
4947.08s: uh anyway when I read that I thought my
4950.84s: god I saw that I know that I saw that I
4954.32s: saw it in my front yard. What happened
4956.48s: was one
4957.56s: morning I got up. It was just I get up
4962.24s: early and it was I I wasn't expecting to
4964.40s: see them, but as I was walking past the
4966.80s: windows in the cabin looking out over
4968.96s: the front yard, there were three of them
4970.32s: standing there up near some trees. And I
4973.20s: thought, "Oh my god." I was trying to
4975.60s: kind of tame them at the time, like I
4978.32s: felt they were like they were very
4979.92s: bird-like. They would fl disappear when
4982.48s: you got near them. So I go creeping
4984.80s: downstairs and out onto the front porch.
4987.92s: is still standing there doing this
4990.08s: moving their arms and you know I'm
4991.76s: trying to figure out what they're doing
4993.84s: and so I step down in the yard and
4995.68s: they're still doing it moving their arms
4997.84s: then there's a telepathic message that
5000.24s: that they're cleansing themselves that
5003.20s: it's waste matter and that they're
5005.72s: literally and and so then I told Bud
5009.52s: Hopkins about this and he said that's
5011.04s: the most disgusting thing I've ever
5012.24s: heard. I told him about the ammonia
5013.60s: smell and it was it was like they were
5015.84s: defecating but they do it through their
5017.44s: skin and he said that's the most
5019.28s: disgusting thing I've ever heard but
5020.72s: that has to be your imagination. So I
5023.12s: figured yeah he's probably right. It is
5024.72s: pretty disgusting. Anyway, I'm not going
5026.08s: to I didn't I dropped it. So years and
5030.72s: years and years pass. I pick up the
5033.12s: Reddit document and the first paragraph
5034.96s: is that described exactly. So I knew the
5038.64s: document had some substance. It is not
5041.20s: perfect genetically. The genetics in the
5044.72s: document, I've had a number of genetic
5047.04s: two geneticists look at it and they say
5049.52s: the man obviously is a
5052.60s: biologist, but their impression was
5055.28s: either that he's talking about genetics
5058.16s: that are very different, which he is, or
5061.76s: and or that
5063.96s: he's probably retired and not completely
5067.92s: up on the science as it is now. I see
5070.16s: him. But nevertheless, in substance, the
5073.68s: document is authentic in that sense. And
5076.24s: to my mind, it's very authentic because
5078.32s: I'm the only person Bud died and no, he
5081.60s: never said that to anybody. Never wanted
5083.36s: to discuss it again. Yeah. So, and then
5085.84s: we heard about it uh during the Vargi
5087.92s: case. Well, I mean, obviously this this
5089.36s: come up uh I think I think even Yeah,
5091.68s: but we didn't hear the idea system.
5094.72s: Yeah. Exactly. Anywhere. No, the just
5097.36s: the smells in the Virginia case. The
5099.28s: smells in that there were uh there was
5101.76s: slime. They were oily. Well,
5107.24s: they a little oily and slimy. Well, you
5111.76s: know, I I have to admit that
5115.24s: u they're
5118.44s: not complicated. Uh they're not
5121.40s: loathsome. They're beautiful in a way.
5125.84s: uh some guys from Bright Pat. I was at
5130.28s: uh doing a book signing in Dayton years
5133.60s: and years ago and a couple of I guess
5136.08s: there were Air Force people from Right
5137.84s: Pat came out. They weren't in uniform
5140.24s: but and they showed me a photograph.
5142.24s: This was before digital photography.
5144.16s: It's a Kodak of three of them standing
5147.20s: under a tree in a neighborhood. No way.
5150.08s: Yeah. this chalk white light coming down
5153.52s: and lighting the top of the tree. And
5155.52s: they were so graceful looking. They were
5159.36s: so they look like little ballet dancers.
5162.56s: And that's how they are. They were very,
5164.16s: very graceful. And I said, "Can I keep
5166.80s: this?" And they said, "No, we just
5168.72s: wanted you to know you're on the right
5170.44s: track." So, uh, how strange. Ah, listen.
5174.96s: Do do you ever feel like that might have
5176.56s: been some type of like way to you know
5179.92s: because obviously people are going to
5180.96s: say well maybe they just showed you some
5182.40s: false information to keep you No, it's
5185.04s: it it was a photograph. I I it you feel
5188.56s: like it was authentic. Well, in those
5191.36s: days making a
5193.88s: Kodak it why would they go to that
5196.88s: trouble? Yeah, I mean maybe they were
5199.60s: just trying to encourage me and it was
5201.20s: fake. I can't say that for sure. But it
5203.44s: doesn't look fake. Not at all.
5207.44s: Yeah. And so, okay. So, their skin has
5210.96s: this uh quality which has these
5213.28s: thousands of pores. These tiny little
5215.20s: pores. Yeah. That But it's
5217.16s: also smooth. Their legs are I've touched
5221.20s: the legs of the lady uh on the cover of
5224.80s: Communion or at least I think it was
5226.32s: her. Mhm. You know, they're I
5229.12s: necessarily say for sure I can tell them
5231.16s: apart, but
5233.16s: uh
5235.00s: uh there's a a definite beauty there.
5238.48s: You just have to get past the fact that
5240.72s: they're radically different from us.
5243.20s: Their odors, their gestalt, their body
5246.40s: feel and everything movements are
5248.96s: completely different from us. Their
5250.88s: hands are very disturbing to be touched
5253.36s: by, etc., etc., etc. But they are there
5257.92s: physically. He'd mentioned their hands
5260.24s: were their fingerprints were more like
5262.24s: concentric circles
5264.96s: in this document. It said that in the
5267.52s: document. I I didn't remember that and
5269.92s: I've never seen their I probably didn't
5271.60s: bother with that cuz I've never seen
5272.88s: their fingerprints. So that wasn't hard
5274.88s: to notice. Yeah, it wasn't something I
5276.88s: would have brought up. But they said
5278.32s: creaseless as well. Their skin was like
5280.88s: free of any creases, any like obviously
5283.36s: at their, you know, um at their joints,
5285.68s: but other than that there was no
5286.80s: wrinkles.
5288.32s: Well, the lady I remember her as looking
5291.44s: old. I asked her at one point, "Are you
5293.84s: old?" And she said, "I'm old." And what
5296.40s: do you think she meant by I'm old?
5299.36s: I wondered about that. Did she mean I'm
5301.92s: 80 or 80,000? I mean, you don't know.
5305.20s: You don't know. And when she says I,
5307.76s: when they say I, we assume that's the
5310.64s: individual you're looking at talking to
5313.44s: you, right? But it's not. It's the whole
5315.92s: mind.
5317.92s: Like one time she said to me, I created
5320.92s: you. And I thought at the time, how did
5324.48s: she create me? I thought my mother and
5326.32s: daddy created me.
5328.44s: Uh but then I thought later if that was
5332.00s: the whole mind speaking maybe she just
5334.96s: said that she created they created us
5338.48s: and maybe they did because they do
5340.40s: manipulate genes a lot you know maybe
5344.00s: maybe the fact that we are so different.
5347.68s: I mean, look at us and any animal, even
5351.68s: the closest animals to us, are light
5354.64s: years behind us.
5357.56s: Like a a chimpanzee or a African gray
5361.56s: parrot can never even understand the
5365.36s: most basic concept of an internal
5368.80s: combustion engine at all in any way
5374.52s: ever. That's the difference.
5377.52s: Yeah, it might even be greater than that
5379.04s: even somehow. It's greater than that.
5382.40s: Yeah, it's even greater than that. So
5385.40s: yeah, maybe they have been searching
5388.72s: this universe for a companion for a long
5391.84s: time and they created us for that
5395.80s: purpose. In which case, if we start to
5400.20s: self-destruct, they're going to be
5402.56s: pooed. Poed or or or intervene. Right.
5405.76s: Well, if they intervene, it's they've
5408.08s: made it very clear to me it isn't going
5410.40s: to be fun because they're it'll mean
5413.28s: that they no
5414.92s: longer they, you know, it will it will
5418.80s: it will turn our whole culture toward
5421.04s: them. Right now, it's just a a few
5423.92s: billionaires looking for tech that they
5426.32s: can exploit and the government looking
5428.64s: for ways to protect us from them. That's
5431.76s: all. It's not important. But if the
5434.32s: whole culture turns them toward them,
5436.48s: then everybody's going to be looking for
5438.32s: cell phones from the beyond. And who
5441.20s: cares about our stuff when they can
5443.60s: cross the universe? I because there's a
5446.00s: there's a lot more than they can that
5447.92s: they can do that we don't see. What do
5450.24s: you speculate would be one of those
5451.92s: things? Instantaneous movement. Yeah.
5454.72s: From anywhere. From anywhere to anywhere
5456.88s: in any time. You think too? I don't
5459.52s: think time. It it doesn't matter I in
5462.48s: the least. It's not in time. It's I talk
5466.16s: about that a little bit in fourth mind.
5470.52s: It's something very very different. It's
5473.64s: not motion as we understand it. It is uh
5478.88s: leaving
5480.28s: the leaving the whole expression of the
5483.60s: of the world, the physical world and
5486.40s: re-entering it at in another place
5489.04s: instantaneously.
5491.20s: And that is a a remarkable power and
5495.76s: they do possess it. M and we're going to
5498.64s: want that very very badly because we
5502.24s: think in terms of Earth now and oh gee
5504.80s: how cool it would be to get in a flying
5506.56s: saucer and go from from New York to
5509.36s: London in 2 minutes. Yeah. How cool
5512.24s: would it be to go to another galaxy in a
5516.40s: second or under a second? Yeah. See,
5520.08s: when when when hearing something like
5522.00s: that and which I assume, you know, in
5523.96s: this this this universe rich with life
5527.80s: and you would have to assume with the
5530.96s: billions of years that this has existed
5532.96s: that if someone had if a race had gotten
5537.04s: to a point where, you know, they were
5538.80s: able to escape their own solar system at
5541.12s: one point, then they would have
5543.76s: eventually reached
5546.36s: this level of technology. Yeah. And if
5550.24s: they did that, like it I my brain always
5552.80s: comes back to this is
5554.76s: that if if I wanted to sustain life
5558.16s: outside of Earth, right? And and
5560.12s: and prolong or even just spread the seed
5564.08s: of mankind throughout the stars, right?
5566.56s: I I wouldn't do so by living in a dome
5569.28s: on Mars, right? No. I would probably
5571.68s: visit planets that already had some
5573.68s: semblance of life and inject my own DNA
5576.16s: into it. Yeah. Therefore, you know, I
5578.16s: could just monitor them and they can
5579.60s: live happily on their planet and it's
5581.84s: still spreading my seed across the
5585.32s: universe. So, I would assume like this
5588.40s: is just my assumption, but I would
5591.24s: assume that they would have done this a
5594.00s: million times over if they're old enough
5597.20s: probably. So, uh like John Vonoyman, the
5600.24s: van machine, Dr. Vanoyman was I'm quite
5604.48s: sure involved in studying this uh when
5608.32s: he was uh uh alive back in the in the
5611.52s: 40s and 50s and he
5615.56s: uh he con conceived of something called
5618.88s: a van that he we call a van machine
5621.52s: which is a uh basically a ship that it
5624.96s: contains the complete
5627.52s: uh uh expression of a species and it
5631.68s: moves moves around the galaxy looking
5634.80s: for planets that it can where it can
5636.88s: plant
5637.72s: its itself. And I've even thought that
5644.52s: maybe I've even thought that
5648.28s: maybe a vono they are a vonoyoman
5651.36s: machine who arrived at a planet that
5654.08s: contained an unexpected presence us and
5657.92s: it's been here ever since trying to
5659.84s: figure out what to do because it's
5661.68s: programmed to seed the planet with
5663.28s: itself but we are already here and it
5666.08s: wasn't programmed to figure that out and
5668.16s: that's why all the confusion exists. Oh,
5670.56s: some strange type of AI. Yeah, exactly.
5673.76s: But you know, I'm this is just
5675.12s: speculation. I mean, I don't know whe
5677.12s: anything is true. And it's very
5678.88s: important in all of these conversations
5680.88s: to understand that the the absolute
5684.24s: ground here in all of this has always
5687.20s: got to be questioned. I agree with that.
5690.32s: But I do think there is value also in in
5693.12s: speculative thinking. I think there is I
5694.88s: think it's essential. Yeah, I think so
5696.40s: too. It allows for our imaginations to
5698.32s: roam and that's where you know a lot of
5699.76s: these great ideas come from and that's
5701.04s: where discoveries are are made. Um you
5704.00s: know there's another document as well I
5705.84s: I referenced this quite a bit in a lot
5707.60s: of past episodes and discussions. Um
5710.96s: there was this gentleman who said he was
5713.60s: part of a crash recovery and that they
5715.84s: were monitoring these
5718.28s: underwater a giant underwater they call
5721.20s: them mobile construction units MCUs and
5724.16s: that they would build these ships to
5726.32s: spec and they would deploy them around
5728.56s: the world almost as if it was like some
5730.88s: type of autoimmune response to us trying
5735.76s: to destroy
5737.00s: ourselves that was planted here along
5739.60s: long long long time ago. And I always
5741.36s: thought that was really interesting.
5743.52s: These ships or these beings or these
5745.04s: entities, these visitors or whatever it
5746.48s: is might be part of some intergalactic
5749.76s: autoimmune
5751.16s: response that because, you know, we hear
5753.92s: about the grays and there's a lot of
5756.72s: speculative um notions that put them
5761.28s: align them more with something like the
5764.32s: idea of AI, like biological AI.
5770.40s: Is is is that just because the gestalt
5773.60s: of these beings is is just so foreign
5776.48s: with their collective consciousness that
5778.32s: we automatically assume it must be some
5780.24s: hive mind AI or is there some truth
5782.32s: there? Do you think that there is I
5784.00s: think it's both. Uh
5785.88s: there's two or three forms of the grays.
5789.36s: The one form are about 3 ft tall. Those
5792.88s: are the ones that we had at Fort Detric
5795.84s: in Maryland that I discussed the anatomy
5798.64s: of in the fourth mind. I don't know
5801.68s: whether they're still there, but I was
5803.36s: told by, you know, one of these subrosa
5806.00s: types, uh, hey, Woodley, I got tell you
5809.80s: something like go over
5811.88s: here, we've got some bodies at Fort
5814.76s: Detric. And I think, oh,
5818.24s: and that was prior to this document. Oh,
5820.00s: a long time ago. It's years and years
5821.36s: ago. So, he was right about that. It was
5823.12s: telling the truth. Yeah. Well, I knew it
5824.88s: was telling the truth for various
5826.32s: reasons. Uh but uh the uh
5831.88s: the whole Subrosa thing is always
5834.40s: laughable to me because I I just don't
5836.68s: understand. You know, what the heck's
5838.96s: secrecyy's kind of gotten out of
5840.84s: control. I always say I said this to uh
5844.08s: Chris Melon. I said, who is a nice guy
5847.52s: and will, you know, chat with me and
5849.36s: stuff and from time to time. We had a
5851.52s: great dinner together once and he's sort
5853.40s: of kind of edging his way into my end of
5856.56s: the thing. Uh, extreme super woo, but
5861.12s: he's still he didn't he didn't he didn't
5863.36s: he didn't run away. He's a he's a cool
5865.28s: guy. Anyway, I said to him, "Chris, what
5867.84s: you should do is if we have an intact
5871.88s: disc, I recommend you put it in the
5874.16s: Smithsonian
5876.04s: Institution." And he said, "I don't
5878.00s: think that would ever happen, but I
5881.20s: think it should because I think it
5883.68s: belongs there. I think this belongs to
5885.44s: all of us." Uh, and I think that
5889.88s: uh as far as anological shock, the
5893.36s: average person isn't going to experience
5894.88s: that. It's the intellectuals, the
5897.28s: scientists, the academics that are going
5899.52s: to experience it and they're just going
5901.52s: to have to suck it up. I sucked it up. I
5903.68s: was an intellectual who experienced it.
5906.16s: And uh I know a lot of other
5907.80s: intellectuals who in fact a lot of them
5910.24s: are close friends who are also
5912.80s: scientists and academics and and in and
5916.40s: in in this whole space who woke up one
5919.36s: night with the visitors in their
5920.64s: bedrooms or whatever happened to them.
5922.80s: We all experienced it. And where are we?
5925.76s: We're fine.
5928.92s: Yeah. Okay. So, we have the little ones.
5933.12s: Yep. Okay. We got the I'm sorry, I sort
5935.68s: of got off track. No. Uh they I think
5938.80s: they are the uh I I think they are not
5943.60s: exactly biological robots because I
5946.16s: think that they are linked mentally.
5948.56s: Their their brains are linked to the
5950.64s: tolerance. They're just like soldiers
5952.40s: like foot soldiers. No, they're
5954.00s: expendable extensions of expendable of
5957.60s: the being itself. Yeah. The real
5960.08s: biological being like when one of the
5964.00s: taller ones comes around there are
5967.80s: guards but when the little ones come
5970.08s: around there are never guards. So you
5972.56s: think the taller ones have a little bit
5974.88s: more um importance? They no they are
5978.28s: biologically unique individuals and they
5980.96s: are each one of them is a unique
5982.60s: personality that is connected to the
5984.88s: larger mind but they are unique people
5988.80s: and they feel like individuals like the
5991.44s: lady on the cover of communion has got
5993.36s: one personality. There are others I've
5996.00s: known who have very different
5997.44s: personalities
5998.96s: but and yet still connected and and yet
6001.20s: I think they all have the same mind and
6002.96s: so the little ones are without
6004.60s: personality. They are and those big
6006.76s: brains, they have big brains just like
6009.28s: the larger ones so that the larger ones
6012.00s: can fully express their minds into them.
6015.44s: But if something happens to it, they
6017.04s: just pull out. That's why they don't
6019.20s: care. You know, when when they talk
6021.36s: about whistling them up and then
6022.72s: shooting them down, they don't care.
6024.40s: They don't care. Right. Right. Doesn't
6026.32s: matter. That makes sense. Yeah. there. I
6028.16s: I always thought to myself, they said to
6030.64s: me a long time ago that you need to feel
6034.08s: that you can defend yourself against us.
6036.40s: Otherwise, that that's a big part of
6038.96s: defeating the idea of of cultural
6041.80s: colonization is our own sense of
6044.44s: independent agency. And we need agency
6048.16s: in against them. And I when I read about
6050.32s: or I guess I heard Jake, maybe Jake was
6052.80s: talking about it. One of them talking
6054.56s: about how they would they get a scionics
6057.20s: personal to call him up and then shoot
6059.36s: him down. I thought to myself, they
6062.24s: don't understand. They're in a training
6063.84s: program. They're being trained so that
6066.24s: we will have agency because they can't
6068.88s: they can't uh engage with us unless we
6072.72s: feel we have agency. And shoot them up
6075.20s: is our agency even though it doesn't
6076.88s: matter to them.
6078.72s: I see. They're doing us a favor. Yeah.
6080.80s: Yeah. In a way. Yeah. Yeah. In a way.
6082.88s: Okay. So, I mean that's very very
6085.28s: interesting because that does make a lot
6087.36s: of sense. I'm just thinking back to the
6089.12s: rolodex of cases and the uh experiences
6092.64s: with these smaller type grays uh being
6097.84s: all about tasks, very taskoriented, very
6101.84s: emotionless.
6103.60s: uh no personality and also you again
6107.52s: like you hear about these crashes and it
6109.92s: seems like the beings like that that
6111.92s: have crashed or whatever or the the
6113.84s: ships that have crashed um the the more
6117.28s: important part was the tech was the ship
6120.40s: wasn't necessarily the beings yeah well
6123.20s: they crashed it what they gave us that
6126.48s: we could use in those crashes was
6128.72s: materials uh Robert Sarbacher Dr.
6131.76s: Sarbacher was uh uh I contacted him
6135.52s: right before he sadly passed away really
6138.48s: through Santon Freriedman in the 80s in
6140.88s: the mid 80s I think in 85 or 88 86 just
6144.80s: when I was starting to research commune
6147.76s: and Dr. Sarbucker was a metalologist at
6149.92s: Patel Memorial Institute and he was
6152.88s: publishing letters, public letters
6154.64s: saying he was working on the Roswell
6156.16s: materials. He wasn't. And he said to me,
6158.32s: I don't see any reason whatsoever for
6160.16s: this to be kept secret. And in fact, the
6162.64s: fact that it's kept secret is holding us
6164.24s: back. And in any case, uh he was the
6168.16s: first person who just suggested to me
6171.52s: that I should write everything down be
6174.48s: he said write it all down before you
6176.40s: forget it cuz you're going to forget it.
6178.48s: And I thought what does that mean? I now
6180.88s: know how the mind brain works and the
6183.20s: brain will will ex expune th things that
6186.56s: it can't fit into rel it has a it's a
6190.08s: relational database and if it doesn't
6192.48s: have anything to relate something to
6194.08s: that will be forgotten. I didn't know
6196.24s: that but he did. So I wrote it all down.
6199.92s: I sent it to him and unfortunately he
6203.16s: died the the day it arrived or the day
6206.32s: before it arrived. I I never got it back
6209.20s: either. I wish I had. But in any case,
6211.76s: he said to me uh that they had made
6216.08s: great strides with the metal,
6218.64s: understanding how that very thin metal,
6221.12s: it was very strong and thin at Roswell.
6223.76s: My uncle said and and uh Jesse Marcel
6226.88s: said uh that you couldn't even shoot a
6229.52s: bullet through, but yet you can crumple
6231.44s: it up and come back. Exactly. And it and
6233.76s: and Michael said you could toss it up in
6235.76s: the air and it was almost lighter than
6237.56s: air yet. So uh Whoa. Yeah, they
6241.04s: mentioned that in Virginia as well. In
6242.64s: Virginia as well. But the point is this
6245.20s: that and things like radar absorbent
6249.40s: coatings apparently come from the
6252.64s: materials that we have found. Wow. And I
6255.68s: have some of that material. And I have a
6258.08s: little tiny piece of uh the of this
6261.28s: stuff that's
6263.12s: layered bismouth and
6264.84s: magnesium uh which I've been more than
6267.52s: willing to offer for study, but nobody
6270.16s: picks up on it. I think they're scared
6271.84s: of me. Um okay. So now we go from these
6274.96s: tiny beings, these um by the way, who uh
6277.92s: do they wear clothes? These these little
6279.60s: ones because we we hear both accounts. I
6282.48s: don't know. The taller ones have a
6284.44s: sheath that they take off. But in other
6288.24s: words, they're they were they they did
6290.88s: not were not wearing the sheath on their
6292.96s: arms when they were I saw them wiping
6296.16s: that stuff. But it's a I and I don't
6299.12s: know if it's biological part of their
6300.96s: biology or not. The sheath. Uhhuh. I
6303.84s: mean, you think of it as something
6305.28s: separate clothing, right? But you just
6308.32s: don't know what's going on here. It's,
6309.92s: you know, it's it's too early to make
6312.16s: any assumptions that what we see
6316.76s: is similar to something we would have is
6319.60s: a mistake. Yeah. Cuz you would have to
6321.28s: imagine because you hear about this even
6322.72s: in the Aztec crash uh in New Mexico,
6325.28s: which, you know, a lot of people think
6326.32s: was a hoax, which I don't think it was a
6327.76s: hoax. I don't think so either. Yeah. Um
6329.84s: there's far too much uh evidence there.
6332.88s: Um, but they even wore like these blue
6336.16s: skintight jumpsuits and you and you hear
6338.08s: about these one-piece jumpsuits and I I
6340.32s: think that's always the thing that sort
6342.00s: of glitches in my own mind is that I I
6344.08s: just can't imagine one of these things
6345.60s: fitting like being in a changing room
6347.44s: and like you know like it's just so
6349.92s: strange. But you know when you're out of
6352.96s: your body you can walk through a wall.
6355.04s: Yeah. As you know. Mhm. And I think that
6359.92s: I have seen these bodies come up out of
6362.48s: a drawer. Yeah. And animated. And I
6365.84s: think that that's not even the bodies
6367.76s: are not their main place. I think they
6370.24s: are non-physical mostly. That they that
6373.36s: they use the bodies to enter the
6375.60s: physical world in the same way we put on
6377.52s: clothes.
6379.76s: Whoa. Yeah.
6381.92s: What? Okay. So, let's let's talk about
6384.08s: these tall beings for a second now.
6386.24s: Yeah. 5 foot tall ones. Yeah. Um, you
6389.76s: know, the the taller beings are the ones
6391.52s: that it seems like are the ones doing
6394.72s: most of the procedures as well. I don't
6397.52s: know. Uh, the one of the taller ones was
6400.72s: in the was it was that
6405.24s: being and some of these dark blue
6408.08s: iridescent kind of trolllike ones which
6410.96s: could have been the smaller beings in
6413.04s: some kind of body armor. I don't know.
6415.68s: But that's what I saw on the night of
6418.24s: the communion night. And uh what
6422.84s: she I I I I see her as a woman, but if
6426.64s: I'd been a woman, I bet I would have
6428.40s: think of thought of her as a man. See
6430.56s: what I mean? I I don't think that's very
6432.72s: real. Uh that perceptional level of
6435.72s: perception. In any case,
6440.12s: uh she was I she I don't know whether
6443.44s: she was wearing something or not. I'm
6445.60s: not sure.
6448.04s: Uh but after Okay. There are also cases
6452.64s: that we hear about and this is like a
6455.12s: little bit more fringe perhaps, but we
6459.16s: often because like you you touched on
6461.76s: they use these
6463.92s: uh small ones as a sort of means to
6466.88s: inject their own consciousness so that
6468.40s: they can control them to do these tasks.
6470.80s: That's my theory. Yep. That's a and that
6472.64s: seems to be what we're observing, right?
6474.72s: It seems to be many people's
6475.84s: observations that it's a robotic kind of
6478.80s: That's right. glove. Yeah, exactly. But
6481.92s: but but a a a very high level
6486.08s: sophisticated sophisticated because it
6488.00s: has let's put it this way, it has a kind
6490.32s: of some kind of rich telemetry. Mhm.
6492.96s: Because that's what telepathy has to be.
6495.04s: It has to be real. I mean, if it's real
6496.80s: and it is real. I mean, I've lived with
6498.88s: it a long time now. Yeah. And I wish I
6501.44s: could live with it more. I wish I could
6503.28s: be a I think it would be so cool to be a
6505.76s: really, you know, a telepath and be able
6507.60s: to project my thoughts into other
6509.12s: people's heads and listen to their
6510.96s: thoughts, but I can't do that. In any
6513.28s: case, that that telemetry must be very
6517.28s: rich and that would be why the little
6518.88s: ones also have big brains as I said
6520.80s: earlier, right? To to receive that to be
6523.28s: able to receive that. And then the
6524.64s: biologist as well mentions like these
6526.40s: nodules that were in their brains too in
6528.96s: this document. Yeah. which I think were
6531.28s: pro probably part of the communications
6533.36s: process. Right. Exactly. Like
6534.64s: genetically enhanced so that they were
6535.92s: able to receive these messages and and
6537.60s: this these commands uh so to speak.
6541.16s: Um okay. So these little ones are are
6544.08s: task oriented. They're controlled
6545.92s: telepathically
6547.76s: um perhaps by the bigger ones. But also
6550.56s: now we're we're going into you look at
6552.72s: Travis Walton. You know, uh, what
6555.68s: happened to Travis, uh, was he had this
6558.32s: runin with these, uh, smaller beings. I
6560.64s: Yeah, I know Travis. Yeah. And then
6563.60s: these human looking beings seemingly
6568.24s: those were the ones that were really in
6570.16s: control here. like almost like these
6572.08s: little ones were for hire or these
6574.64s: little bodies were um you know again
6578.08s: used by a different race or a different
6579.96s: type in order to do you know the mundane
6584.40s: work. And then when he met these taller
6586.64s: beings, he realized, oh, like he wasn't
6588.08s: sure if this was, you know, now looking
6590.32s: back if this was them projecting a
6592.36s: human, you know, coding or or something
6595.28s: or if it was just to please him or if,
6599.04s: you know, that's what they actually
6600.48s: looked like. Yeah, it could have been
6602.00s: any of the above. And this could also
6604.56s: have a human factor because as I recall
6606.80s: in the document it says that
6610.60s: uh there's 80% DNA match between us and
6614.80s: those the bodies that they had. And
6617.68s: that's not enormous. I mean we've got a
6620.96s: closer DNA match with cattle for
6623.20s: example, right? But it's there. It means
6625.84s: that there's a sort of a basic ground of
6628.64s: of shared shared ground there somewhere.
6633.72s: Uh,
6637.24s: so could it be that there is a human
6640.16s: element to this? Well, that gets me to
6642.40s: the implant in my left ear, which was
6646.24s: put in in
6647.48s: 1989. Oh, I found out recently in one of
6650.08s: my books, it says 1992. It's a typo, by
6652.72s: the way, for anyone who likes to dig
6654.96s: deep. I It's supposed to be 89. The copy
6658.32s: editor just missed it. In any case, uh,
6661.36s: in May of 1989, this thing was put in my
6663.88s: ear, which I've talked about many times,
6666.64s: and I'll talk about it more if you want
6668.08s: me to. Yeah, I would love that. Okay.
6669.60s: But, but it was put, the point is it was
6671.92s: put in by two people, a man and a woman.
6675.36s: I've always said there may have been
6676.96s: something else standing behind them, but
6679.20s: I did not see that. I just had that
6681.80s: feeling. And the man was a tall guy with
6685.92s: beard wearing dark blue suit, dark blue
6688.96s: clothes. And the woman was shorter,
6692.04s: wearing a dark blue tighter fitting
6695.48s: garment. And it was a totally sounded
6699.28s: like a totally human operation in this
6701.88s: sense. It was a May evening. The windows
6704.72s: were open in our bedroom in the cabin
6707.52s: and there was crunching in the driveway.
6709.76s: It was a shale driveway. Two problems
6712.76s: here. Three really. One, there's a big
6716.52s: gate. Two, it was night. There were no
6719.68s: car lights involved. The crunching in
6722.16s: the driveway meant it was a vehicle. All
6724.72s: bad news because it's 11:00 at night.
6728.56s: And this cannot be good. I
6731.72s: had the following. A shotgun, in fact, a
6735.52s: big one. Vanelli riot gun under the bed.
6738.80s: a pistol in the drawer beside the bed
6742.24s: and a bank of light switches, which are
6744.40s: still there in the cabin, by the way.
6746.56s: And you turn them on and flood lights
6749.44s: flood the whole area. Plus, there was an
6751.76s: alarm system which was
6753.96s: armed. And I wake up because I hear the
6758.00s: crunching of the gravel. The next thing
6760.64s: I know, I I start to go for the lights,
6765.52s: but as I'm turning, I see a man and a
6767.92s: woman standing at the foot of the bed.
6771.20s: And with the alarm system still LED red,
6775.12s: and I hear a voice from the backyard say
6777.44s: quietly, "Condition red." And I I forget
6782.00s: the lights. I'm going now for the gun. I
6784.80s: don't get that far. The next thing I
6786.96s: know, I'm lying not on I was turning to
6788.96s: my left, but I'm lying on my right side.
6791.68s: Someone is presumably the man is pushing
6794.64s: hard against my head. I cannot see. I
6797.68s: cannot move my arms and legs. And I'm
6800.32s: being my head's being pushed in waves
6802.40s: down into the pillow like this. And the
6805.60s: woman's voice is talking to me very
6808.44s: gently. That lasts for a few seconds,
6811.44s: maybe 10, 15 seconds. I don't remember
6813.44s: the time at all. The next thing I know,
6817.04s: there's a flash of light crashing in the
6819.68s: woods like somebody running like hell
6821.20s: through the woods. I jump up out of bed,
6824.24s: grab the pistol, see the LED is still
6828.00s: red, think to
6829.88s: myself, is that what happened? I'm
6832.72s: totally confused because if somebody
6835.12s: came in here, the alarm should be
6837.32s: ringing. I run through the house looking
6839.76s: for an entry point. I even go in the
6842.32s: attic because the alarm system is still
6844.80s: on and I do not find an entry point
6847.64s: anywhere. I end up sitting on the
6850.44s: bedside thinking, "What in hell was
6854.52s: that?" Then the next morning it becomes
6857.04s: obvious because of things, weird things
6859.52s: in the house like the alarm system is
6862.12s: still light is still red. When I go out
6865.28s: to get the paper and turn off the alarm
6867.12s: on the pad on the in the garage, the
6870.00s: garage door is wide open and yet the
6872.64s: alarm is not tripped. So I call the
6876.00s: alarm guy. He comes over eventually and
6878.88s: he says there's a heavyduty magnetic
6880.96s: field around the door and I don't
6883.60s: understand where it would come from
6886.08s: because of course we don't have such a
6887.84s: thing as a free floating magnetic field
6889.76s: or we didn't we do now. I think uh I I
6893.20s: think that's public. Anyway, we have the
6895.60s: free floating magnetic field. Now, I
6897.68s: read about it
6898.76s: somewhere. Uh in any case, th this uh is
6905.00s: impossible. So, we he checks it all out
6908.00s: and all he can do is just replace the
6910.00s: switches, which he does. We try to get
6912.48s: the the record from the alarm system.
6915.84s: It's all garbled and screwed up. You
6918.32s: can't tell anything from it.
6921.04s: Then the next day, my ear starts to
6923.16s: hurt. I realize I've got a something
6926.32s: there, a bump. And I already knew Dr.
6929.76s: Roger Lear, who in those days was taking
6931.84s: out implants in
6933.96s: California. And so I say to Ann, I these
6937.52s: people were real and they put an implant
6939.36s: in my ear. I want it out. She says, "No,
6942.64s: don't get it taken out. Let's see what
6944.88s: it what it does." You know, I'm the guy
6947.84s: on the front line. She she was behind
6949.76s: the lines so she could say that. And I
6951.84s: said, "Well, wait a minute. I don't want
6952.96s: to be tracked." She says, "Nobody cares
6955.76s: where you go down to the news get a
6957.60s: newspaper every morning or go down to
6959.36s: the 7-Eleven and get a six-pack of beer.
6962.16s: So, you're not going to be tracked for
6963.60s: long if that's what it's
6965.48s: about." And
6967.64s: uh I get I kind of let it be and because
6971.28s: it will turn on, it turns red. I can't
6974.40s: figure it out. It makes a noise every
6976.72s: once in a while.
6979.32s: Finally two
6981.16s: uh mid90s come I guess it's 96 I meet a
6985.12s: doctor in San Antonio my hometown who
6988.80s: says yeah I'll take a look at it he
6990.72s: thinks it's a cyst he doesn't I don't
6992.40s: tell him about the implant and uh when
6997.28s: he tries to take it out it's all on tape
6999.28s: on my website by the way unknown country
7002.12s: uh he tries to take it out it comes goes
7005.52s: down into my earlobe
7007.44s: on its own. It moves through the under
7009.52s: the skin and
7012.84s: it's blows his mind of course and he
7015.60s: immediately sews up the little incision
7017.92s: he's made. Two days later it comes back
7020.40s: up to where it is to this day. But see
7024.88s: this last but then it goes I guess it
7027.68s: went under. But that's the hard part.
7030.48s: But it disappeared again. Maybe that's
7033.20s: it's actually moving now. Well, he's
7035.12s: poking it, but it went under. Uh, it's
7037.68s: on the run.
7039.92s: Well, it kind of is cuz I could see it
7041.52s: just bright as day and now it's uh I
7043.60s: don't see it.
7046.32s: See, this isn't uncommon. By the way,
7048.56s: you shouldn't let the camera see this.
7050.64s: After Annie passes away, a slit opens up
7054.16s: in my left eye and words come racing
7056.96s: through it. And I use it as a research
7060.56s: tool. To this day, all the books I've
7063.92s: written
7065.40s: since the afterlife revolution have used
7068.56s: it as a research tool. And what it does
7072.24s: is it those words are bringing memories
7075.92s: up from deep in my memory banks to the
7079.64s: forefront and enabling me to have a much
7082.56s: larger memory than we usually do. It is
7085.92s: guy by far the most valuable research
7089.36s: tool I have. It's much better than AI
7092.80s: and AI is very good. Whoa. Can I see
7097.04s: this? Yeah, you absolutely. I'm so
7100.96s: curious.
7105.92s: It's right
7107.24s: here. It's been pushed in by the But you
7111.44s: you can feel it if you can't see it. My
7113.68s: math.
7114.84s: Yeah, you you got it. This here. Uh, let
7119.12s: me see. My finger's right on top of
7123.08s: it. Huh? You feel it? I feel a little
7126.64s: lump. Yeah, that's it. There's also a CT
7130.00s: scan of it. Yeah.
7133.64s: So, I mean,
7135.80s: because you know, something like
7138.12s: that would be a smoking gun, right? If
7141.28s: you were to remove it. Yeah. If you were
7143.92s: to have that in your hand like this and
7145.68s: show that's why they did not
7149.36s: that's why it they it's evasive. Yeah.
7152.96s: The ones Roger Lear removed all had that
7155.44s: evasive quality too. A lot of them got
7157.60s: away. Lu Alzando mentioned that in one
7160.64s: of his in the recent book he he wrote to
7162.80s: Imminent. Yeah. He had mentioned that
7164.56s: they had also um that they were sort of
7168.00s: encoded and that's how the body doesn't
7170.24s: reject it. like it's there's a coating
7172.16s: around these implants. Well, the I don't
7174.32s: know if there's a coding around this
7175.76s: one, but the ones Roger ex uh excised
7180.24s: and that we then studied at Southwest
7182.40s: Research in San Antonio unofficially,
7185.36s: but with the permission of the director,
7187.52s: Bill Malow, the director of material
7190.36s: science, did SEM and stuff for us on
7193.68s: them. It's no in no way did
7196.60s: Southwest doesn't you know in other
7198.88s: words they they're this was separate.
7200.96s: Yeah. So uh uh but he would find them
7206.24s: encapsulated in epidermis but buried in
7209.84s: deep muscle tissue. There is no way the
7212.80s: body can produce epidermis in in muscle
7216.16s: tissue. It doesn't have the genetic
7217.52s: encoding to do that. So, it was
7219.52s: something that was made and the result
7222.24s: is that the epidermis from the person
7224.24s: and you'll usually find a little scoop
7226.08s: mark scar elsewhere on their body where
7229.60s: the epidermis was removed from under the
7232.16s: surface layer of the skin to make the
7234.64s: encapsulation. I see. So, it's made of
7237.20s: your own body. Yeah. The
7239.72s: encapsulation. So, it doesn't reject and
7242.08s: it doesn't uh Yeah. trigger any any
7244.08s: flags and it would just show up as a
7247.04s: cyst. It would feel and look identical
7249.52s: to a cyst. Yeah, exactly. Except if you
7252.64s: X-ray it, it's if it's a real implant,
7255.92s: it's got iron in it, it's going to be
7257.44s: very clear. Like the one in my ear, you
7259.20s: can see it immediately on the CT scan.
7261.04s: It's a clears a bell, a little white
7263.84s: disc.
7265.60s: That's one implant in me. Yeah. But
7269.12s: there's many implants in people. There's
7271.04s: there's also the nasal.
7273.44s: Yeah. I I thought I had one of those,
7276.00s: but I had uh MRI scanned and they didn't
7279.76s: find one. Yeah, cuz that seems to be one
7281.60s: of the more popular implants that you
7283.92s: hear about is this uh the long rod that
7286.64s: is then which is inserted. Amazing
7289.76s: because you know the nose is not exactly
7292.72s: absent bacteria and viral particles to
7296.80s: to be able to put something up there and
7299.04s: goes up into the upper part of the nasal
7301.76s: cavity or maybe even into the brain
7304.40s: means that they have absolute control
7307.76s: over uh the potential for spreading an
7311.52s: infection into the brain. Yeah. But also
7313.68s: I mean that would make sense that even
7315.60s: in this um the biology report that most
7319.44s: of their muscles are all in their hands
7322.80s: like they don't use their forearm
7324.88s: muscles to control their hand movement.
7327.20s: They have very precise. Their hands are
7329.92s: their finger. They've got four fingers,
7332.00s: the ones I have seen. And that's also
7334.64s: what's described in the document. And
7337.20s: they move like snakes. They look like
7339.44s: snakes when they're moving. Like
7340.64s: individually, like Well, they Oh, yeah.
7342.72s: They can move in individually, but
7344.24s: they've got all those extra additional
7346.16s: joints, so they're very snaky. Um, you
7349.84s: know, when the old
7351.08s: lady, the communion lady, I uh she's
7354.72s: still around. And I'm pissing her off by
7356.16s: calling her the old lady. Please excuse
7358.64s: me. In any case, uh, she was coming
7362.40s: around the house a lot in the late 90s,
7366.48s: I guess, in 80 I mean late ' 80s, 88 and
7370.96s: 80 back in there. I think she was very
7374.56s: pleased that with communion and she was
7377.44s: hanging out there and we didn't see her
7379.68s: much. You know, you get glimpses of her.
7381.36s: She was very careful about that. But one
7384.56s: time my little boy brought up a friend
7387.92s: who had uh had a an accident and had
7392.00s: hurt his his uh uh had a scar on his lip
7397.52s: from something that he had done as a
7399.12s: little boy that she apparently thought
7401.28s: was very
7402.68s: careless. And she did not want this boy
7405.44s: in our lives. And all the night he was
7408.00s: there, she kept coming to my bedside and
7411.92s: I would open my eyes and I could never
7413.84s: move when she was nearby. Never willing.
7416.64s: I was not under control. And I would see
7419.04s: her and she'd have this smoke pouring
7421.04s: out of
7421.96s: her side of her mouth. And then she'd
7424.48s: project scary images of my little boy
7427.36s: going over to his house in a cab in
7429.20s: Manhattan and the cab driver kidnapping
7431.12s: him and all this stuff designed to scare
7433.12s: me. in the morning. Little boy, the bed
7438.72s: uh of the guest bed in the boy's bedroom
7441.60s: was across the hall from the door and my
7446.24s: son's room bed was in the in the corner
7449.68s: so he could see the door. And apparently
7452.88s: all night she had been opening the door
7455.28s: and tapping with her nails. And in the
7458.40s: document it doesn't say says they don't
7460.08s: have nails, but she definitely had them.
7462.56s: and scraping up and down the door with
7464.40s: these snake- like fingers. And he said
7466.72s: that I he'd seen that all night. And he
7469.28s: said, "Mr. Fever, would you please take
7470.96s: me home?" I took him home and he never
7473.52s: saw him again. He described them as
7475.04s: snakes, too, didn't he? Yeah. Yeah.
7477.24s: Yeah. He was scary. Poor kid. I mean, he
7480.64s: was just the nicest kid in the world and
7482.72s: so bright, but she she did not like him.
7487.52s: No reason for that that you know of.
7489.44s: Well, yeah, because he had that accident
7491.20s: and she thought he was careless. Just
7492.80s: that that that was the sole reason. The
7495.60s: only reason I know I can think of
7498.24s: because the smoke it involved he burned
7501.04s: his his lip and right uh the that smoke
7504.96s: coming out was indicating to me that
7506.96s: that was what she was concerned about.
7509.88s: Interesting. Um all right, here's a bit
7512.48s: of a here's a bit of a strange question.
7516.12s: Um, we hear about, okay, these taller
7519.28s: ones dealing with the smaller ones. We
7520.88s: hear about some human ones, like the
7523.20s: ones involved in your implantation or
7525.76s: the ones involved with uh Travis. But
7528.64s: then we hear
7529.64s: of mantis type. Is this something you're
7533.52s: familiar with? No, I can tell you all
7536.00s: I'm familiar with is the grays. Yep. In
7539.28s: two forms. The tall whites as adults and
7543.36s: children, male. Mhm. A male and female
7545.92s: adult, male, child. Uh, and these dark
7550.48s: blue troll-like figures, which maybe
7553.28s: small grays and suits or maybe an
7555.36s: entirely different
7556.84s: species and uh humans associated with
7560.72s: this group them in some way. Yeah. But
7563.60s: what that is, I don't know. Okay. And I
7566.56s: have seen one
7569.04s: uh person known as a Nordic under
7572.08s: circumstances where I knew for certain
7573.76s: it was not a human being. How did you
7575.44s: know?
7576.64s: Uh, I can't get into that, but suffice
7578.88s: to say, it was in a it was in a
7581.60s: situation with a
7583.48s: uh uh it it was in a situation
7588.84s: where I I was once involved in this uh
7594.16s: with some people from the defense
7596.32s: department. I don't want to get into it
7597.92s: too deeply because they've all passed
7600.12s: away, but I was told at the time not to
7604.16s: get, you know, not that I could tell the
7606.48s: story, but not to get get into detail.
7609.20s: So, I'm not going to get into
7610.92s: detail. He was a um a Nordic and uh I
7616.64s: met him briefly and had a brief exchange
7620.48s: with him uh where he told me some he
7624.48s: said an interesting thing actually. He
7626.40s: said, "Never get into a war with the
7628.40s: grays because they'll never let you win
7631.92s: and they will never let you stop
7633.36s: fighting." And every time I hear these
7635.68s: guys shooting at him, I think to myself,
7638.32s: they could be playing with fire. You
7641.20s: they need to be aware of this, but I
7642.88s: don't think they are. Was this um and
7646.80s: like pardon pardon me for asking more,
7648.40s: but the the Nord thing really interests
7650.08s: me, but is there um was there anything
7652.96s: particular about this being that
7656.76s: felt unhuman? His
7660.36s: eyes
7662.20s: were they had uh they were green as I
7666.72s: recall. And he he didn't look I've heard
7669.12s: descriptions of Nordics that are much
7671.84s: less humanlooking than what I saw, but
7674.72s: that that was what I was told he
7677.88s: was. He was more humanl looking than
7682.16s: other descriptions of the Nordics I've
7684.60s: heard. And I thought he I thought the
7687.92s: tall whites were Nordics for a while for
7690.16s: that reason. I was very confused about
7691.92s: that. But he was more humanl looking and
7696.00s: he was not a lot taller than I was. He
7698.64s: was probably about 6
7700.52s: uh seven or so. And
7704.76s: um he was very sweet and and there was
7711.60s: he was almost a ghostly feel about him
7714.56s: like his eyes were weird and
7717.72s: uh and as I say he he spoke physically
7721.68s: as I recall. I don't recall him being
7723.48s: telepathic or at least not addressing me
7726.08s: telepathic with an American accent was
7727.92s: it? I don't remember any accent so I
7730.96s: would assume so.
7732.76s: Mhm. And um blonde or blonde? Yeah.
7737.76s: Blonde. Tall blonde. Green eyes. Yeah.
7742.32s: And you were um they told you that this
7745.20s: was a Nordic. He told me. He said no. He
7748.48s: said I am not of you. of you is what he
7751.84s: said of you of you. And uh then
7756.00s: afterwards the man involved in this said
7759.44s: that he's what we call a Nordic and I
7762.32s: said where is he from? And he said we're
7764.64s: not sure. I said what do you mean? I had
7768.88s: heard by that time and I had said aren't
7770.88s: they from the Pletes? And he said,
7774.08s: interestingly enough, he said, "In that
7775.92s: direction, we believe."
7779.24s: H But, uh, that's that's it. That's what
7783.12s: I've seen. There's a lot of, um, there's
7785.92s: a lot of con, you know, I mean,
7787.36s: connections to be made with the Nordics
7789.20s: as well throughout history with, you
7791.12s: know, obviously the Nazis. Um, so
7794.00s: creepy. Operation High Jump and, you
7796.64s: know, um, the Arctic.
7800.32s: Well, there's it gets all into this kind
7802.24s: of racist conspiracy theory crap that I
7805.12s: don't I I don't go down that but I mean
7807.04s: even in uh if you look at the Italian
7809.52s: crash that happened um the magenta crash
7812.80s: in 33 the bodies retrieved there were
7816.08s: like incredibly tall blonde Nordicl
7819.68s: looking uh humans uh humanlike uh that I
7823.92s: didn't know about the bodies. Yeah. And
7826.16s: apparently that was one of the re and
7828.56s: this is all again probably speculative
7830.88s: but apparently that was one of the
7832.08s: reasons why uh Mussolini had you know um
7836.48s: contacted the Germans because he thought
7838.16s: it was them you know. Yeah. Well I can
7840.88s: understand that. I that I'm whatever
7844.00s: happened then I'm glad that they didn't
7845.60s: figure out whatever technology might
7847.04s: have been involved because that would
7848.64s: not unless they did. Yeah. Or unless
7850.80s: they that was part of the uh you know
7853.28s: part of the search. Yeah. Well, Joseph
7855.04s: Frell says that the thing that crashed
7857.60s: in Kexsburg, Pennsylvania, the bell. The
7860.80s: bell. The Kexsburg bell was German.
7863.84s: German technology. And yeah. Yeah. Was
7866.96s: it? Yeah. And
7869.32s: Frell's, you know, love him or hate him.
7872.08s: He's a brilliant man and uh a very very
7875.84s: fine researcher. So, and willing to go
7878.24s: down paths that nobody else goes down
7880.40s: and capable of it. Yeah. Do you think
7882.16s: there is um
7883.80s: currently a government program that is
7886.72s: working alongside ETS in some way,
7889.36s: shape, or form? Whether it's the Nordics
7891.20s: or whether it's the tall whites. I've
7893.68s: wondered if it was a government program
7895.92s: or something that is detached from the
7899.20s: government uh but
7902.28s: still looks like a government program.
7905.68s: Uh I was years ago I was
7909.32s: uh involved with u the Senate Select
7913.12s: Intelligence
7914.36s: Committee. They were asking me qu
7916.88s: questions about my book Majestic the
7919.76s: their
7920.84s: uh their council was Dick Damato. And as
7925.76s: I
7927.08s: recall, and I might be wrong about this,
7929.68s: but one of them, either one of the
7931.84s: senators or one of their assistants said
7933.68s: to me that they had found a military
7935.52s: base that wasn't on the Pentagon's
7938.00s: roster, but and yet was still being
7941.44s: paid. The people there didn't know they
7943.92s: weren't actually part of the US
7945.52s: military. But then years later it turned
7948.32s: out that there could be zillions of
7950.16s: those bases because the
7951.72s: Pentagon's budget is a complete is a
7954.56s: complete mess. You know, it's actually
7956.96s: it's not a complete mess. I think I
7959.36s: think that the missing money that they
7961.68s: say they can't find is the black budget.
7964.24s: And I think it's massive. And that gets
7966.48s: you to Richard Dolan and the breakaway
7968.60s: civilization. I think it's damn real.
7971.20s: And if you look at the parts of the
7973.36s: Pentagon budget that they say they can't
7975.28s: find,
7976.68s: that's us paying for it and not being
7980.00s: told it exists. Yeah. And that doesn't
7981.92s: include all of the black money that
7984.72s: isn't on the budget. That isn't on the
7986.56s: budget at all, you know, from arms trade
7988.72s: or from drug, you know, trafficking or
7990.96s: or what have you. I mean, there's more
7993.20s: than one ways to get dirty money. That's
7995.12s: another ugly rabbit hole there. the
7997.96s: whole use of drug trafficking to sure to
8002.32s: funnel through these black budget uh
8004.56s: programs. Okay. Uh what we're going to
8006.72s: do um we're going to take a quick little
8008.48s: break. I do have um so the audience I I
8011.92s: I give them a quick heads up on our
8014.00s: Discord and I allow them to ask uh
8016.80s: several questions to our guests. We'll
8018.32s: have three questions. I just have to go
8020.00s: set up a camera behind here because I'm
8021.44s: a oneman operation. Uh so if you don't
8023.52s: mind, we'll take like a maybe like a
8025.04s: fivem minute break. I'll set that up and
8026.72s: then we'll do that and uh we'll go on
8028.48s: for maybe another 20 minutes if that's
8030.08s: if that's all right with you.
8031.04s: Absolutely. Perfect. Thank you, Willie.
8035.28s: You're very psychic. You've got a lot of
8038.40s: resonance coming out. I can feel it and
8040.64s: and experience it as you're talking and
8043.60s: as you're listening. And uh probably not
8047.68s: a lot of your guests are actually aware
8049.20s: of that, but they respond to it anyway
8051.20s: unconsciously. Yeah, maybe that's why
8053.12s: you get such good responses from your
8054.88s: guests. Say, you really really are made
8058.24s: for this. This is your this is your
8060.16s: wheelhouse, man. Yeah, I believe so,
8062.40s: too. Yeah, absolutely. It's true. I
8064.72s: think my whole life has brought me to
8067.36s: this point. Yeah. And I would have hit
8070.24s: myself for thinking that way a decade
8072.08s: ago. Yeah. But at but here you are.
8075.20s: You're doing it. And who knows where it
8077.04s: may lead. Yeah. It's going to be lead in
8078.88s: some extraordinary directions. I think I
8080.80s: think I think it already has and I
8082.16s: believe it will continue. Yeah. Yeah.
8084.48s: Okay. So, who knows? Maybe it'll be
8086.72s: sitting across the from a gray or a
8088.88s: Nordic or something one of these days.
8090.88s: This is the hope is that this eventually
8093.52s: leads
8094.44s: to you know it's I mean I don't I don't
8097.44s: share this at all with anybody but
8101.00s: um I kept having this
8103.80s: vision
8106.04s: that I mean it sounds silly that I would
8108.64s: be someone I that I would film first
8112.84s: contact in some way but that and it's
8117.28s: it's not something I like saying out
8118.56s: loud because it's I mean it sounds weird
8120.48s: and pretentious and but it's just this
8122.88s: thing that I keep seeing
8125.72s: and it is
8128.20s: um not by accident as in I'm given
8133.96s: permission in some weird way in some
8136.64s: strange way and I've shared this with a
8138.08s: friend of mine um who had the same
8142.72s: almost the same vision but he played a
8144.88s: different part in this and so it was
8147.12s: just strange that I had that uh
8149.92s: But yeah, I don't know, you know, I
8151.12s: don't know what that is, but but yeah,
8152.72s: ideally one day I think it would be
8154.88s: interesting for, you know, if this is
8156.40s: the means of communication that that
8157.76s: we're so used to in today's day and age.
8160.40s: Um, yeah, that that that would be the
8162.64s: format that this would happen in that
8164.48s: someone would be sitting across from me,
8166.80s: you know, and answering questions. Well,
8168.56s: that that could I think it could happen.
8170.72s: You know,
8171.80s: people fairly often, I mean, not I I
8175.36s: it's an exaggeration to fairly often, on
8179.48s: occasion, people have come into close
8182.40s: into physical contact with the grays
8185.64s: after meeting me. And uh it's it's
8190.40s: happened fairly frequently over the
8192.08s: years, you know, maybe in the past 20
8195.32s: years, 10 times, eight times. Wow. But
8198.80s: that's not nothing, you know. In other
8200.56s: words, it's not nothing. That's not
8201.76s: nothing. No. So, maybe it'll happen to
8204.40s: you. I I I hope it does because I think
8206.80s: you could you could probably do it.
8210.80s: Well, if uh if this is an open
8214.04s: invite to have them come on the podcast,
8217.12s: uh they're more than welcome. Yeah. Boy,
8218.80s: I mean, that would that would do it for
8220.88s: you. That'd be a good good one for you.
8222.72s: Yeah, that video would do okay, I think.
8224.56s: Right. Yeah. Um All right. Hey, I'm uh
8227.36s: the only reason I'm pulling up my phone
8228.40s: is because this is linked to my phone.
8230.00s: I'm not trying to be on my phone uh
8231.68s: currently. Don't worry, I don't care. Um
8234.00s: all right, we have a few questions here
8235.60s: from our lovely audience is we call them
8237.36s: interns. Uh they have a membership every
8239.76s: month and they get extra stuff and this
8241.20s: is one of the perks and they get to ask
8243.28s: our guest uh some questions. So, should
8245.92s: be the first one popping up here.
8253.52s: If you could go back to an event from
8255.68s: your past as an invisible spectator to
8259.44s: gain clarity,
8261.84s: what event would it be by
8265.16s: Hex0811? Well, I think in my case, the
8268.00s: answer is pretty obvious. I would go
8270.32s: back to the abduction experience in
8275.04s: December the 26th,
8277.24s: 1985 to observe what actually was
8280.80s: happening because I have only my own
8284.00s: memory and anyone knows that memory
8286.88s: isn't is not a reliable source of
8289.68s: information. We do our best with it, but
8293.04s: especially memories that are not
8297.60s: uh contextualized by the brain that are
8300.56s: that there's no nothing to relate to are
8304.32s: very
8305.56s: malleable. And I would like to be sure
8309.52s: that the memory is accurate. Uh the the
8313.92s: one thing I will say for it is that
8315.92s: memory is so vivid. It has never changed
8318.72s: in all these years. So, I think it
8321.68s: probably is accurate, but I would just
8324.24s: like to know for sure. Yeah. And get
8326.44s: gaining perhaps a different perspective
8330.64s: um you know, maybe in the room or in you
8333.12s: know, in your own house or or from
8334.88s: outside the home, what that looked like,
8336.96s: I'd imagine would be interesting. And
8340.28s: also the suspicion that my complete
8345.88s: crazy response was also funny. I would
8349.92s: like to know whether or not that's true
8351.60s: because I've suspected it might be. I
8354.32s: mean, not to me it wasn't funny, but
8356.24s: maybe to people watching it, it would
8358.00s: be. There's something comical about a
8360.56s: person being that scared about what were
8363.04s: basically just a bunch of little tiny
8364.72s: beings that look like monsters to him. I
8368.16s: don't know. I' I'd just like to go back
8369.84s: and see what it to to get a a
8373.44s: perspective on it. That's a very cool
8375.44s: question. Thank you. Yeah, great
8377.20s: question, Hex. Yeah. Uh, we got another
8379.60s: one here from Maverick Star. Another
8381.60s: great question here. Um, this is a
8384.96s: little bit related to the psionic stuff
8386.72s: that we talked about. Um, it says, "Your
8390.44s: opinion." I'll let it finish here. Your
8393.68s: opinion on C5 exercise and should people
8397.04s: perform this by Maverickstar?
8399.60s: I don't see any reason not to, but let's
8401.84s: not become orb tourists. In other words,
8404.88s: it's not hard to conjure up to get an uh
8408.16s: something to
8409.24s: appear. What is hard is doing something
8412.40s: with that because when something
8415.72s: appears there, that is an invitation
8418.80s: that okay, let's take the next step.
8422.00s: People just sit there. They don't take
8424.96s: the next step because they don't know
8426.92s: how. But it is possible. And I can't
8430.96s: tell you how in two minutes, but you
8434.80s: it's a whole new life that is being
8438.44s: offered. And we got to take that basket.
8441.36s: And so far, we're not doing that. We
8444.40s: need to really look into ourselves and
8447.20s: ask ourselves, everyone who does C5s,
8450.00s: including the people in the government
8451.68s: and and the all of everyone, what do we
8455.28s: do next? We get an orb to show up. Then
8459.28s: what? It's the then what we have to
8462.56s: figure out each of us in their own heart
8466.32s: and all of us as a community.
8469.84s: If you were to give Jake Barber and his
8473.44s: team some advice on the then what? Okay.
8476.56s: The advice, the first thing I would, the
8479.52s: first piece of advice is learn to master
8483.44s: your
8484.36s: attention. Because right now when you
8487.60s: when an orb shows up, you respond in a
8491.28s: very primitive way with throwing your
8494.48s: attention out to it just
8497.24s: willy-nilly. Your attention is your
8500.56s: signature. It is literally a signature
8504.40s: that they see as a signature. And when
8507.44s: your signature is a mess and all out of
8510.48s: control, they have no respect for it.
8513.36s: But if you if you can control your
8515.84s: attention, you give it carefully,
8519.20s: willingly, and lovingly, and openly, but
8522.16s: you give it. You don't let it you don't
8524.32s: let the event take it. And you hold some
8526.96s: of your attention back within yourself.
8530.00s: You learn and that's the beginning and
8533.04s: they will see that and respect that.
8535.80s: Later as you work with this, you learn
8539.28s: to find the parts of you of being that
8542.96s: are outside of your ego and to
8548.40s: uh express your attention from there.
8551.12s: Then they're going to be really
8552.72s: interested in engaging with you because
8555.28s: that means you're on their level. Now
8558.72s: you've gone to the next step. You've
8560.32s: taken the next step. And we're far from
8562.56s: that because right now we're looking for
8566.20s: technology which is, you know, know
8569.60s: thyself. That's the beginning of this
8571.76s: technology, right? It always seems to be
8575.72s: the what I always come back to with this
8579.04s: phenomenon. More I look into it, the
8581.12s: more I try to dig deep, the more I try
8583.36s: to find answers, the more it's pointing
8585.68s: me inwards. Yes. And and I I think that
8589.04s: you know prior to the podcast you know
8591.12s: we spoke about out of body experiences,
8592.96s: we spoke about remote viewing. Um and
8595.20s: these are these are things that are
8597.20s: heavily
8598.80s: um achievable
8600.92s: through internal perspective only.
8604.64s: They're not achievable if you put it out
8607.12s: there. It's got to be in Exactly. It's
8610.96s: got it's got to be in both places. Uh as
8614.48s: above so below. as within also without.
8618.40s: uh but you know we have to we have to
8620.32s: come to
8621.56s: this from a standpoint of strength and
8626.28s: capability because if we look if we show
8628.88s: ourselves as strong and in control of
8631.04s: ourselves and that's has to do with con
8634.00s: with proper control of your attention
8637.84s: and the sense of self-worth and
8640.24s: self-love that you have your inner peace
8643.20s: all of these things come into it uh your
8646.24s: recognition of the existence of your
8648.08s: soul. If you're doing this with, you
8650.00s: know, with a from a western secular
8653.12s: viewpoint and thinking you you only have
8656.00s: meat in your head, forget it. It's not
8658.16s: going to work. You might as well go home
8659.76s: because that's not it's not what it's
8661.36s: about. Uh it is about something that to
8665.20s: them they have a science of the soul
8667.92s: that is precise, very precise. When I'm
8671.44s: explaining about taking control of your
8675.08s: attention, I'm I'm talking about
8678.60s: reflecting an awareness of that sort of
8682.88s: science which we don't know anything
8684.80s: about in our world. What's the closest
8687.04s: thing to that? Like cuz I'm really
8689.84s: interested in that. I'm really
8690.88s: interested in this interfacing with this
8692.56s: ET in in a way that they understand it.
8695.04s: And I think a lot of people are really
8696.56s: interested in that because that's like
8697.52s: the fringe. That's where that's where I
8699.84s: think first contact happens is is
8701.88s: through this
8704.04s: um this medium that that that that is
8707.24s: fragile that is ephemeral that is like
8710.40s: barely
8711.56s: understood. Is it closer
8714.20s: to like a dream state? Is it closer to a
8719.20s: deeply sort of meditative state? Like
8721.52s: what is what does that look like in that
8724.16s: interface? How does that feel like? Is
8727.28s: there anything you could relate it to
8729.36s: that I would understand?
8731.96s: Uh, let me let me give it a
8734.92s: shot. It's it's first it's hard to put
8737.68s: into words obviously because it's not a
8740.96s: verbal thing. But if I could do this,
8746.56s: there is a a taste of essence within us
8750.48s: all that when you taste that, when your
8753.52s: attention touches it, you know that's
8756.60s: me. And it's not it's not Chris, it's
8760.00s: not Whitley, as we talked about earlier
8761.92s: in the
8763.08s: show. It
8765.08s: is that which is behind that, the silent
8769.12s: presence that is me. And
8773.24s: uh it's getting to that and living in
8777.44s: that and seeing from that that your ego
8780.80s: then becomes a tool, a life tool. But
8783.92s: you are not that life tool. You are the
8787.20s: being behind it. And this being is has a
8791.68s: universality to it. It has and where do
8795.60s: you get to that? You get to that through
8798.84s: uncompromising, clear,
8801.96s: loving, careful
8804.68s: self-nowledge, understanding yourself.
8807.52s: Know yourself and you know the whole
8809.84s: world and you know them. But that's
8812.48s: where it begins. It has to begin there.
8816.24s: I know it's frustrating. No, that's I
8818.24s: mean that's great advice. I mean it just
8821.28s: makes so much sense to me that that
8822.72s: would be the medium in which we use to
8825.20s: connect would be to the same mechanism
8828.00s: that's used to connect with ourselves.
8829.92s: You know my wife she knew this like the
8832.64s: back of her hand and she used to say I
8836.16s: said well where do you
8838.12s: start? She said Whitley you need to
8840.56s: laugh at yourself. Laughter is the
8843.20s: beginning of everything. And the great
8846.76s: mystic of the I guess the 13th century
8850.24s: Meister Ehart used to say and it's the
8854.00s: title of one of his sermons I believe
8855.84s: even God laughs and
8858.52s: plays. When we start to laugh and play
8862.48s: in the context of our journey toward
8865.68s: inner search and self-nowledge then we
8868.80s: start to see because if you can laugh at
8871.36s: yourself you got a chance to see
8872.96s: yourself. Love that.
8875.96s: Beautiful. We got a last question here
8878.00s: and this one will will round off the the
8880.64s: interview nicely here. This is from
8886.60s: Tess. By the way, thank you to all the
8889.28s: interns for asking your questions on the
8890.88s: Discord. I appreciate it. What wisdom
8893.68s: garnered from your experience with the
8895.52s: phenomena do you wish to impart to the
8897.84s: next generations?
8900.32s: The next generations are so important.
8902.64s: That's why on Dreamland I have Kelly
8905.60s: Chase is my co- uh she she does the show
8910.08s: once a month. She's young and the next
8914.00s: generation is absolutely critical to me.
8916.24s: That's what I'm about is communicating
8918.96s: this to the next
8920.68s: generation. What do I want to impart to
8923.36s: them?
8925.28s: something an said that maybe is the most
8928.48s: important thing of all, especially for
8931.68s: the next
8932.60s: generation. The human species is too
8936.00s: young to have beliefs. What we need are
8939.92s: good questions. You guys go out there
8943.20s: and find the right questions and ask
8946.00s: them. Ask them inside yourselves, in
8948.64s: your hearts, to each other, to the
8951.28s: universe, and to all who are here trying
8956.00s: to relate to us because they want those
8959.36s: questions. That's where we start.
8962.72s: Beautifully said, Whitley Streamer. It
8965.28s: was an absolute pleasure having you on
8967.28s: my show. I am really uh grateful for
8970.40s: your presence and I am so happy that we
8972.32s: had a chance to connect here. Um, and I
8975.04s: hope that this conversation resonates
8977.36s: with the audience out there, which I'm
8978.56s: sure it will. Um, but thank you for
8980.80s: everything you do. Um, guys, if you want
8983.04s: to check out Whitley's books, obviously,
8985.44s: uh, do that. I will leave the link
8986.72s: below. His new book, Fourth Mind, is
8988.72s: out. Uh, we will have Whitley sign a
8991.44s: couple of these. And if you want a
8993.28s: chance to win one, I'll just pick one of
8995.36s: the comments. So, like the video and,
8997.36s: uh, and leave a comment. We'll reserve
8998.96s: one for the interns and one for uh, the
9001.76s: public comments here. Willie, is there
9003.52s: anything you want to end on? Yeah. The
9007.84s: one thing I ever heard verbally that my
9011.68s: wife an thought was the most important
9013.76s: thing of all, have
9016.84s: joy. Have joy. Not happiness.
9021.48s: Joy.
9023.40s: Joy. And we'll end it there. Thanks,
9026.08s: Willie.
