1.60s: We were driving and I said, "Oh, that
4.16s: that guy's dressed interestingly."
8.08s: There was a guy walking along the lake
10.80s: by the side, you know, on the side of
12.24s: the road and he looked just really
16.16s: different. And we continued talking and
18.80s: we drove about another quarter of a mile
20.96s: and I said, "Oh my god, there's that guy
23.04s: again." and he was walking towards us
25.52s: again, but about a quarter mile past the
28.88s: first place that we saw him. Um, talk
32.16s: about freaked out. That was really
35.44s: strange. Don't know what it was, but
37.84s: I'll never forget it.
 Ladies and
40.48s: gentlemen, welcome back to another
41.68s: episode of Debriefed. My name is Chris
43.28s: Ramsey and today we're going to be
45.52s: taking a look at a cold case, a UFO cold
49.28s: case, if you will, from an issue of UFO
52.08s: Report magazine in 1976.
54.64s: A 13-year-old boy was regressed
57.12s: hypnotically into going back to his
61.04s: alleged abduction where he was taken
63.12s: aboard a craft and studied by what seems
66.24s: to be these extraterrestrials. I thought
68.40s: it was a really, really interesting
69.68s: case. And you know, I've got stacks and
71.92s: stacks of these magazines and heaps of
73.76s: these stories that sort of really went
77.04s: under the radar in eufology. I mean,
80.16s: there's many, many of these stories.
81.60s: Obviously, they're the ones, you know,
82.96s: that we're familiar with. The Betty and
84.40s: Barney Hill case, the Travis Walton
86.16s: case, the Pascula case, all sorts of
88.88s: really important alien abduction
91.20s: stories, but this one I thought was
93.92s: particularly interesting, and it's
95.68s: something that I wanted to get into with
97.36s: you today. There's so much gold in these
100.00s: old books and magazines. And you know,
102.72s: often history tends to repeat itself.
106.48s: I'm sure a lot of people who've been
108.40s: following UFOs and aliens in the past 50
112.00s: years have said this time and time and
114.08s: again that it seems to be just the same
116.72s: thing over and over again. You know,
118.64s: there are no new revelations. We can
121.52s: talk about Matthew Brown tweeting this
124.88s: really cryptic sort of tweet denouncing
128.24s: these special access programs and this
130.72s: these esoteric sort of depictions that
133.20s: he put out there. Or we can talk about
135.28s: this Wall Street Journal debacle where
137.20s: they said the entire UFO community is
140.80s: just one big SCOP and that the military
143.60s: actually put out fake UFO stuff to cover
147.20s: up the special access programs. or we
149.84s: can talk about another alleged
151.60s: whistleblower who came forward on 4chan
154.40s: talking about, you know, all of the
156.80s: stuff that's going to be coming out in
158.40s: the future. But folks, the truth is that
161.52s: a lot of this stuff isn't new.
164.64s: I have so much respect for the people
166.16s: who came before me studying this
168.40s: phenomenon. You know, we stand on the
169.92s: shoulders of giants, people like Stanton
172.00s: Freriedman and even Richard Dolan, who
174.16s: we interviewed recently in our
175.84s: documentary. Thank you, by the way, to
177.20s: those of you who watch that. I mean,
179.36s: even Colonel Wendell Stevens with his
182.24s: numerous books on UFO contact cases.
186.56s: There are thousands upon thousands of
189.04s: these reported cases and stories. And
192.48s: each and every one of them to me is
194.24s: equally as fascinating. And I find it a
196.32s: little redundant to move forward when
199.68s: honestly taking a look back might
202.24s: provide us with answers that aren't
204.48s: infected by the current internet
206.72s: zeitgeist.
208.24s: And sometimes folks, that's all we need
209.92s: to do. And and I'm a big fan of
211.44s: nostalgia, if you couldn't tell already.
213.92s: I'm not going to spend my time chasing
215.76s: ambulances in the UFO scene. I think
218.96s: there are plenty of people out there who
220.48s: are doing a fine job of that.
222.48s: Personally, I find it way more
224.96s: interesting and compelling to take a
227.60s: look back at some of the cases that
229.60s: might not have gotten enough attention.
231.92s: Just came back from contact in the
233.52s: desert, probably the biggest UFO
235.36s: conference or convention in the world,
237.76s: and it was a phenomenal time. Got to
239.52s: meet and hang with a lot of people. if
240.64s: you want to see some behindthe-scenes
242.00s: stuff that went on there. I also
243.84s: uploaded a vlog of my week spent in Palm
247.76s: Springs, you know, chatting with various
250.24s: faces that you might recognize in the
251.76s: UFO community that is available on the
254.08s: membership here on YouTube or on
255.92s: Patreon. And just before we get into
258.64s: everything, folks, a quick word from the
261.76s: sponsors that make these episodes
263.28s: possible.
265.62s: [Music]
269.44s: I was digging through an old case when I
271.44s: found it. A file with my name on it. And
274.56s: not from a government archive and not
276.24s: from a conspiracy board, but from a data
279.28s: broker. See, it turns out they knew more
281.60s: about me than some of my friends do.
283.76s: Phone number, email, pastes,
286.80s: habits, preferences, purchases I barely
289.92s: remember making. And I didn't hand that
292.72s: info over, but someone did. You see,
296.16s: there's a whole industry out there built
297.92s: on tracking you. Not for national
300.64s: security, but for profit. And that's
303.76s: where incogn. You give them permission
306.08s: and they start pulling your name off
307.76s: those lists legally and efficiently,
310.88s: like cleaning fingerprints off glass.

327.36s: might be the ones with your name on
328.80s: them.
330.80s: All right, folks. We paid the bills.
333.60s: Let's get into it. 1976,
337.60s: April 1976,
341.12s: UFO Report Magazine. Now, these
344.24s: magazines are just fantastic. They're
346.32s: they're absolutely filled with gold
348.24s: nuggets. Like if you don't know already,
350.64s: definitely if you can get your hands on
352.00s: some of these official UFO magazines or
354.64s: the UFO report or whatever they may be,
357.28s: they are just filled to the brim. Like
358.64s: there's a Jacques Valet interview in
360.72s: here from 1976.
362.88s: I mean, some of the headlines read,
364.16s: "Target Earth is Canada
366.72s: sight of an alien invasion." and then
369.28s: probe link between UFOs and animal
371.12s: mutilations and gods from inner space
373.12s: and extraterrestrials among us and
375.44s: fantastic giant starships and UFO beams
378.16s: that heal all within one magazine.
383.60s: But none of those headlines are what
386.08s: we're going to be focusing on today.
387.68s: We're going to be focusing on this
388.96s: little story that I came across and I
390.48s: thought just such a rare little treat.
392.40s: You know, if you want to help this
393.36s: channel out for absolutely nothing, for
395.44s: free, simply like this video, subscribe,
398.72s: hit the notification bell, or leave us,
401.04s: you know, a favorable review um on
403.12s: Spotify, wherever you're listening to
404.48s: this on your audio podcasts. The
406.40s: headline, which we'll be looking at
408.08s: today, reads as follows. Contact TE
410.24s: supplies new clues to UFO mystery.
413.92s: Revealed for the first time. This story
416.16s: of a 13-year-old boy taken aboard a
418.40s: flying saucer and given a thorough
420.72s: physical examination rivals the UFO
423.76s: kidnap cases of Betty and Barney Hill
426.72s: and two fishermen from Pasigula. This
429.28s: article by Ban Slate. What we're going
433.20s: to go through here is the transcript,
434.96s: the hypnotic regression transcript of a
437.44s: doctor and the patient. The patient
438.64s: being this 13-year-old child who we'll
441.92s: call David here. I'm not sure if that's
443.52s: his real name, by the way. 1976. If he's
446.56s: 13 in 1976, that's roughly 50 years ago.
449.76s: This gentleman would be 64 years old.
451.92s: David, if you're still around and
453.84s: listening to this, please reach out.
457.44s: Would love to hear from you. I think it
459.28s: would be a nice surprise for the
460.48s: audience to to have some type of
462.00s: follow-up here. So, I'm going to read
463.52s: it. Um I'll I'll I'll just be saying
465.60s: doctor and then David. These are the two
468.56s: people that will be communicating with
469.92s: each other. Doctor,
471.92s: now David, you feel very well. I would
475.84s: like you to see yourself on the 19th of
477.76s: November last year. You can visualize
480.16s: that. You can see yourself there. All
483.12s: right. Will you tell me where you are,
486.80s: David?
488.48s: I'm in the empty lot. Doctor. All right.
492.72s: Look around and tell me everything that
494.32s: you see. David, I see an object. Doctor,
500.32s: where is the object?
502.40s: David,
503.92s: in the sky.
506.64s: Doctor, how far is it? Can you see it
510.08s: very well, David? Yes.
514.72s: Doctor,
516.32s: where is it?
518.80s: David,
520.48s: above me.
523.76s: Doctor, what color is the object in the
526.40s: sky? David, silver grayish.
532.16s: Doctor,
533.68s: what else do you see as far as this
535.28s: object is concerned?
538.00s: David,
540.08s: it has a color band of lights around the
542.16s: middle of it, doctor. What color are the
545.36s: lights that you see, David? David,
549.12s: all colors. Green, yellow, blue, orange,
553.20s: red, pink. Doctor, what happens next?
557.60s: David,
559.68s: they put a beam on me.
562.16s: Doctor, what color is the beam? David,
566.08s: orange.
568.08s: Doctor, where does this beam come from?
573.12s: David,
574.64s: the ship.
576.88s: Doctor, what part of the ship?
580.72s: David, the middle on the bottom.
585.20s: Doctor, how do you feel when the beam
587.20s: touched you? David, I was sort of in a
590.48s: trance.
592.16s: Earlier, David had stated under hypnosis
594.32s: that when he saw the beam coming down,
597.04s: he felt frightened. Now, he was
599.68s: describing a second reaction after it
601.60s: touched him, and he was being pulled up
603.76s: into the ship.
605.92s: Doctor, did the beam grab hold of your
608.08s: arms or did it grab hold of your body?
610.24s: What does the beam do to you, David? It
613.60s: just brought me up in the ship. Doctor,
617.60s: how did it bring you up? Like you were
620.32s: going up in an elevator.
622.56s: David,
624.16s: no. Doctor, did you feel a funny
627.44s: sensation as you were going up? David,
631.60s: no. Doctor, were you frightened?
635.68s: David,
637.60s: no. I was in a trance.
641.20s: Doctor, did you scream? David, no.
646.16s: Doctor. All right. Now, what's going on?
649.68s: Keep telling me what's going on. David,
652.64s: the beam is bringing me in the ship now.
655.44s: I see a monster.
657.68s: Doctor, tell me about the monster.
661.84s: David,
664.72s: it has scaly skin.
668.56s: It has holes for its nose and holes for
671.28s: its ears.
673.52s: And it has a slit on its face for a
675.52s: mouth.
677.36s: It's brown.
680.24s: Doctor, how many monsters do you see?
684.80s: David, two.
687.92s: Pause here for a second. It seems as
689.84s: though
692.40s: we might be dealing with
695.44s: some type of reptilian creature, but I
697.84s: wouldn't jump the gun on that too
699.28s: quickly because if we take a look at Dan
701.76s: Burrish, Dan Burrish, who is, you know,
704.48s: very, very famous whistleblower
707.52s: known for working at S4 directly with an
711.04s: alien race that he calls the JROD. The
714.00s: description he gave of the J-Rod was
717.28s: also brown,
720.32s: was also scaly.
722.96s: He also said that by those descriptions,
725.52s: and if you were to look at its skeletal
728.40s: structure and everything else, you might
730.32s: assume that it would be reptilelike
735.04s: without necessarily being a reptilian.
738.16s: Screen was raised and we were finally
739.84s: told what we were working with. When I
742.32s: first saw him, I was looking uh through
744.40s: the glass from the gallery. He looked
746.32s: like a bug. That's by my
 That's by your
748.56s: own hand.
750.64s: Well, was approximately 3 and 1/2 ft
752.40s: tall. He had a dark brown appearance,
754.40s: very ruddy appearance to his skin, large
757.68s: head in comparison to torso, large
760.08s: bulbous black eyes, four very thin suous
763.84s: fingers. Uh nose was recessed to aula to
768.56s: orifice. An extremely small
771.92s: uh mouth and a hard pallet, no teeth. My
775.52s: original
777.04s: feeling was I was looking at a giant
778.96s: insect.
780.48s: The particular ruddy configuration of
783.04s: their skin can make them appear very
785.68s: reptilian in appearance. Uh out of a
788.56s: group of people experiencing them that
792.40s: more than 50% of the group could have
795.52s: probably say that they were reptilian in
797.44s: appearance. M
 uh if you would look in
800.48s: his eyes, you'd literally feel yourself
802.32s: falling into his eyes. Uh and then he he
805.20s: after entrainment, this is how they get
807.20s: you to relax in your bedrooms at night.
810.16s: The the rogues, if they take you, they
812.48s: entrain to what makes you feel good and
814.80s: then they flood flood you with
816.08s: endorphins.
 Are you saying that that's
817.84s: what
 that's why you feel relaxed?
 That's
819.52s: what happens during an abduction.
 Yes.
821.36s: That's why you feel relaxed. He started
823.68s: to flood me naturally because he wanted
826.64s: to speak with me. So it began to
830.08s: naturally flood as I was speaking with
832.24s: him and he felt me resist because I was
835.44s: told in the training to resist and so he
837.92s: eventually stopped it. This is as the
839.68s: relationship progressed.
 He stopped
842.88s: trying to make me feel good. That had
844.72s: consequences too. The consequences for
847.52s: me not feeling good was that I was under
851.04s: incredible fear in his presence. I felt
853.76s: afraid inside
856.00s: because
857.76s: I was always told that monsters weren't
859.44s: real and now I find out they are but
862.00s: they live in the heart of men. Doctor,
865.36s: what was there about the skin that made
867.12s: you think it was scaly?
869.60s: David, it looked like a crocodile skin.
874.48s: Doctor,
876.24s: what is there about a crocodile? David,
878.72s: it's sort of rough all over. Doctor, is
882.80s: there anything else? David, no.
886.48s: Doctor, what did their backs look like?
889.60s: Did they have a crocodile back, too?
892.96s: David, I never saw their backs. Doctor,
896.64s: did they have any clothes on? David, no.
900.48s: Just that sort of skin,
903.20s: doctor.
904.56s: Were they smiling,
906.64s: David? No.
909.60s: Doctor, were they angry?
912.64s: David, no.
915.92s: Doctor, were they happy?
919.60s: David, no. They didn't show any
921.92s: expression.
924.16s: Doctor, tell me everything that's
926.24s: happening now. David, they put me on a
928.88s: sort of a cot.
930.80s: He's looking at my body.
933.36s: Doctor, what about your body? David,
936.16s: he's studying it. He took my clothes
938.40s: off. Doctor, all of your clothes. David,
942.48s: yes.
944.00s: Doctor, your shoes, your socks. David,
947.92s: yes, doctor. Your trousers, your shirt,
950.88s: your underwear. David, yes, doctor. And
956.08s: he left your jacket on. David angrily.
958.80s: No,
960.56s: doctor. All right, David. Now, what is
962.72s: happening, David? They're bringing me
967.28s: through a hallway into another room.
971.20s: Doctor, what does the other room look
973.92s: like?
975.68s: David, it has all sorts of bright lights
978.64s: in it.
980.88s: Doctor, what else do you see? David,
984.64s: there's another table there.
987.20s: They put me on that table.
990.32s: doctor.
992.00s: And now David.
994.32s: David.
996.08s: He's lifting my head up. He's lifting it
999.04s: up. His voice is extremely frightened
1002.16s: and plaintitative, as if wanting to
1004.96s: escape from something.
1007.44s: He looks at my hair and my eyes and my
1010.24s: nose.
1011.76s: Now David's breathing rises and falls
1014.64s: with gasps and sobs as he relives that
1018.08s: terrifying moment.
1020.72s: Doctor, how many are looking at you?
1024.16s: David, four.
1027.12s: Doctor, what are they like?
1029.68s: David, they all look the same. Doctor,
1034.16s: can you tell me something more about
1036.08s: their face?
1038.48s: David, it's sort of scary.
1042.72s: Doctor,
1044.32s: what about their head?
1046.56s: David, it's round.
1050.24s: Doctor, how many hands do they have?
1054.48s: David, two.
1056.72s: Doctor, are their hands very similar to
1059.52s: yours? David, no.
1065.20s: Doctor, what are they like,
1068.80s: David? They're like real rough, doctor.
1074.08s: How many fingers do they have, David?
1077.92s: Four.
1081.12s: Doctor, do they have a thumb as well?
1083.28s: David, no.
1085.44s: Doctor,
1087.44s: how big are these beings? David, about 6
1090.08s: feet. Doctor, they're they're nicel
1092.88s: lookinging beings, aren't they?
1095.36s: David, no.
1099.20s: Doctor, what are they wearing? David, it
1102.48s: looks like they're not wearing anything.
1104.16s: They have a brown sort of scaly
1106.40s: skin-like.
1109.52s: Doctor, how many feet do they have?
1111.68s: David, two
1113.92s: doctor, what do they have on their feet?
1116.64s: David, there's nothing on their feet.
1119.12s: Doctor, how many toes do you see on
1121.28s: their feet? David, four.
1124.72s: Doctor, what else do you notice about
1126.48s: them that's unusual? David, they only
1129.52s: have four fingers.
1132.00s: Doctor, is there anything else about
1133.44s: them that's different? David, they have
1136.40s: holes for their ears and nose and a slit
1139.04s: for their mouth. Doctor, are they saying
1141.44s: anything to you? David,
1144.24s: I can't understand.
1146.48s: Doctor, why can't you understand?
1150.24s: David, it's a
1152.72s: it's a strange language.
1155.52s: We're going to pause here for a second.
1157.20s: The four fingers and four toes
1161.76s: seem to be exactly
1164.48s: what so many others have described with
1167.20s: these type of beings. It's such an
1169.20s: interesting detail when you think about
1170.72s: it. If you're
1172.88s: fantasizing about this or if you're
1174.72s: making this up, now remember this is
1176.40s: 1976. there aren't so many things
1179.68s: readily available especially for a
1181.60s: 13-year-old
1183.52s: to in terms of like information that one
1185.76s: can consume about these type of beings.
1187.92s: So 1976 fairly early in regards to
1193.60s: information about abductions. The ebo
1196.48s: molecular biologist that came forward on
1199.20s: Reddit, which was also featured in
1201.44s: Whitley Strieber's book, The Fourth
1203.28s: Mind, mentions the four fingers, also
1206.72s: mentions,
1208.88s: I think he mentioned two toes,
1211.84s: but they were kind of like this and that
1214.24s: they had two. So, like four toes, but
1217.84s: that they were sort of like this. So
1219.68s: maybe we're not dealing with entirely
1221.36s: the same species as the, you know, the
1224.48s: common gray, but these ones seem to be.
1229.60s: Now, I can't remember if Dan Bers's type
1232.16s: had
1234.56s: four toes. I think he did. Size and
1237.28s: built, roughly 49 to 5t tall with a
1240.00s: slim, slender body. Now,
1242.96s: to a 13-year-old child, 5t, 6 feet might
1246.40s: seem
1248.40s: similar, especially from, you know, a
1250.48s: position, a horizontal position. There's
1252.80s: an amazing website called
1254.64s: burisharchive.com
1256.48s: by Brian Jackson. Brian gave us a
1258.88s: presentation at Contact in the Desert,
1260.88s: but Brian had been extensively
1262.96s: researching
1264.56s: Dan Burrish or Dan Crane's case uh for a
1267.76s: very long time. And my conviction level
1270.16s: on on this gentleman having worked with
1273.84s: at least having worked at S4 is very
1276.40s: high, especially after the presentation.
1279.12s: But if you go to this site, there's
1280.88s: everything you need to know about the
1282.48s: Burish archive. Anyways, I'm getting
1285.52s: sidetracked here. The Burish stuff is
1287.84s: incredibly fascinating. So, if you want
1289.36s: to check that out, I'll leave the link
1290.80s: to that below. Let's get back to this
1292.88s: language because I do find this
1294.32s: interesting that they have a language
1295.68s: here. Doctor, he's not speaking English.
1298.80s: David, no. Doctor, imitate the sound
1302.24s: these beings are saying.
1305.04s: Now, David makes a long buzzing or
1307.04s: humming sound,
1309.36s: which much like a giant bee or some type
1312.64s: of machinery. Dr. Masson asks him to
1316.72s: repeat it in case they could detect a
1318.48s: pattern which might be deciphered.
1322.56s: Very intriguing.
1324.56s: Like a buzzing, huh? Doctor. And who is
1328.72s: saying this? David, just one of them.
1332.16s: Doctor, what is he doing this for?
1335.76s: David, he's telling the others. Doctor,
1340.32s: what is he telling the others? David,
1343.36s: pause.
1345.36s: I don't know. Doctor, what is he doing
1349.04s: while he is saying this?
1351.36s: David.
1352.96s: He's looking at my body.
1355.52s: Doctor,
1357.04s: have you ever been on a table like this
1358.80s: before? David?
1361.60s: Yes. Doctor,
1364.56s: where?
1366.32s: David, in an operating room.
1370.56s: Doctor, what's going on now? You're on
1373.04s: the table. David pauses, breathing
1375.92s: heavily, as if not wanting to remember.
1379.36s: The psychologist repeats the question,
1381.28s: telling the hypnotized boy that he will
1383.92s: be comfortable and not frightened by
1385.76s: anything that he sees. David,
1389.52s: they put this other thing over me.
1392.56s: Doctor, what other thing? What does it
1395.12s: look like? David, it's a grayish color
1398.88s: and they just throw it over me. And then
1401.20s: this big huge orange colored light comes
1404.56s: down and is shown on is shun on me.
1409.36s: Then one of them took sort of a needle.
1413.04s: Doctor, what's the needle look like?
1415.92s: David, it's gray. It's small.
1419.44s: Doctor, now what does he do?
1424.32s: David, he sticks it in my arm. Doctor,
1427.84s: were you awake all the time when you
1429.44s: were in this room? David, yes. Doctor,
1433.84s: did they give you anything to eat or
1435.68s: drink? David, no.
1438.32s: I was sort of in a trance.
1441.76s: Doctor, how did you feel in that trance
1444.24s: state, David? Sort of. I felt funny.
1450.08s: Doctor, what do you mean by funny?
1453.52s: David, I felt numb.
1457.76s: Because David had made reference to
1460.08s: being in an operating room before, the
1462.32s: psychologist wondered if his UFO
1464.16s: experience might have been a flashback
1466.08s: to a young boy's traumatic first
1468.24s: operation. And he explored this. Doctor,
1472.24s: you said that room looked very much like
1474.08s: a room you've been in before. David,
1476.32s: yes. Doctor,
1478.64s: when were you in that other room, David?
1481.52s: When I got Well, it looked something
1485.12s: like in the hospital. Doctor. Okay,
1488.16s: David. We're going to let this go. You
1491.20s: won't see that anymore. I'd like you to
1493.68s: tell me when you went to the hospital.
1496.96s: David, I got my appendix out.
1500.48s: Doctor, when was that, David? I was in
1504.96s: grade four.
1507.28s: Doctor, okay, you're going to go right
1510.08s: back to when you were in grade four. You
1512.80s: had to go to the hospital because you
1514.40s: had to have an operation. Now tell me
1517.04s: something about that hospital and what
1519.20s: it looks like. David, you mean in the
1521.92s: operating room?
1524.32s: Doctor, yes, if you'd like. David, they
1528.08s: have these big lights, shiny ones.
1530.32s: Doctor, how many doctors do you see?
1532.72s: David, two. Doctor, what are they
1535.68s: wearing? What is on their faces? David,
1538.96s: a white sort of mask. Doctor, do you see
1542.32s: anything else in the operating room?
1544.32s: David. Nurses. Doctor, how many nurses
1548.16s: do you see? David, three.
1552.32s: Doctor, is the doctor saying anything?
1555.04s: David, no.
1557.12s: Doctor, are the nurses saying anything?
1559.92s: David, no.
1562.80s: Doctor, what does the doctor do to you?
1566.56s: David, he cuts my stomach open. Doctor,
1570.72s: just a minute. Before he cuts your
1572.80s: stomach open, does he give you an
1574.40s: anesthetic? David, they gave me that in
1578.08s: the room.
1579.84s: Doctor, how did they give you the
1581.60s: anesthetic? David, it was a needle.
1586.00s: Doctor, who gave you this needle? The
1588.48s: doctor or the nurse? David. The nurse.
1592.48s: Doctor, I want you to see the nurse as
1594.88s: she's giving you the needle. What color
1597.04s: is the nurse's hair? David.
1600.32s: Brown.
1602.16s: Doctor, what color is her face? David,
1605.92s: like ours, flesh colored. Doctor, is she
1609.92s: wearing a mask? David, no.
1613.44s: Doctor, how do you feel now? David, I
1617.04s: start to get sleepy. Doctor, are you
1619.84s: closing your eyes? David? Yes.
1624.00s: Doctor, now where do you go from the
1626.64s: place where you had the needle? David,
1628.96s: the operating room. Doctor, and how do
1631.68s: you get there, David? David, on a table,
1635.28s: doctor. Okay, your eyes are closed.
1638.64s: You've had the needle. And now I want
1641.36s: you to tell me what you are seeing.
1643.84s: David, the orderly comes in and he puts
1646.32s: me on a table and wheels me to the
1648.00s: operating room. Doctor,
1650.80s: can you see the orderly? David. Yes.
1654.32s: Doctor, what does he look like? David,
1658.56s: he's an old man and he's dressed in
1660.72s: white and he has white shoes on. Doctor,
1664.24s: what does he look like exactly? You say
1666.16s: he's an old man. Tell me everything
1668.08s: about him. David, he's got wrinkles on
1670.96s: his face and hands, a big nose.
1674.72s: Doctor, what about his hair? David, it's
1678.56s: gray.
1680.16s: In a review of the tape of this hypnotic
1682.08s: session, it is obvious to the listener
1684.08s: that the psychologist is trying his
1686.08s: professional best to somehow connect
1688.40s: David's aliens with the surgeons that
1691.20s: operated him on the Canadian in the
1693.36s: Canadian hospital. However, David
1696.40s: remained consistent in his story
1698.48s: throughout. Doctor the orderly. Does he
1701.68s: have a lot of wrinkles? David. Yes.
1704.40s: Doctor, can you tell me something else
1706.40s: about him? Is he tall? Is he short?
1709.04s: David, he's short.
1711.52s: Doctor, does he talk to you? David, no.
1716.48s: Doctor, what does he do? David, he just
1721.12s: brings me and puts me on the table and
1724.08s: wheels me to the operating room. Doctor,
1727.28s: who puts you on the table in the
1728.80s: operating room, David? The same orderly.
1732.08s: Doctor, does he say anything then?
1734.56s: David, no, he just leaves.
1738.16s: Doctor, as he leaves, do you look at
1740.40s: him? Try to look at him. Is there
1742.80s: something else you can tell me about
1745.36s: this orderly? David. No.
1750.16s: Doctor, you're in the operating room
1752.64s: now. Who's the first person you see?
1755.68s: David. The doctor.
1758.96s: Doctor.
1760.96s: What does the doctor look like? David.
1764.56s: He has black hair, wears glasses, has a
1767.84s: mask over his face, has one of those
1770.40s: white sort of dresses on and gloves.
1774.48s: Doctor, what do the gloves look like?
1777.52s: David, they're sort of rubber gloves.
1780.64s: Doctor, what color are they? David, sort
1784.88s: of white.
1787.76s: Under the persistent questioning, David
1789.92s: goes on to describe the other masked
1791.92s: doctor in the room who is gray hair and
1794.80s: doesn't wear glasses. The nurses who are
1797.52s: also masked wearing white dresses and
1799.84s: white shoes. The psychologist probes for
1802.48s: a more detailed description of the
1804.72s: surgery's team's hands, hoping to find
1807.12s: the link in David's mind, which will
1809.20s: connect with the four-fingered brown
1811.60s: scaly alien hands. He doesn't succeed.
1816.96s: I like that they included this. It's
1818.56s: really, I think, important to include
1820.80s: this as well, that the psychologist
1823.68s: isn't completely just leaning into the
1826.16s: alien possibility, but also exploring, I
1830.32s: think, with healthy skepticism, the
1832.08s: possibility that this child might just
1834.24s: be recalling some other traumatic event.
1837.20s: And this comes up time and time again
1839.84s: during regression, hypnotic regression
1842.88s: sessions. People often think that a lot
1848.08s: of these abductions are just some type
1850.08s: of former trauma or even like sexual
1852.56s: trauma that has been repressed in the
1854.72s: past. And I don't think that that can be
1857.44s: completely excluded,
1860.16s: but I think definitely isn't always the
1863.52s: case.
1864.72s: I think it's important to look at this
1866.40s: in that way that you know perhaps there
1869.76s: is some type of even self-inflicted
1873.04s: screen memory that we impose in our own
1875.04s: minds to hide us from some traumatic
1877.04s: event but then also equally interesting
1879.52s: to see
1881.44s: two similar events be described
1884.08s: completely differently and that there is
1886.32s: no link between the two. I think that's
1888.40s: just a really interesting point here. So
1890.56s: if anyone else was thinking, well, it's
1892.16s: probably just like when he went to the
1893.52s: hospital, then why would he describe it
1896.56s: so differently if it was the same event?
1898.80s: Clearly, this child, at least
1900.56s: subconsciously, knows the difference.
1904.80s: Doctor, what about the nurse's hands?
1907.04s: David, they have gloves on, too. Doctor,
1910.08s: are the gloves very tight? David, yes.
1913.92s: Doctor, can you tell me something else
1916.56s: about their hands? David, pause.
1920.56s: The nurses.
1923.04s: Doctor. Anybody's hands. David. The
1926.32s: doctor's hands had hair on them and he
1928.64s: had scissors in them and a needle.
1931.20s: Doctor, a needle. David. The nurse had
1934.40s: the needle. Doctor, what was she doing
1937.20s: with the needle? David, she was just
1940.56s: holding it. Doctor, does the doctor put
1944.40s: anything in your arm? David, no. Doctor,
1949.04s: doesn't he put anything over your nose?
1952.48s: David, no. Doctor, are you asleep or are
1956.64s: you awake? David, asleep.
1960.80s: Doctor, he cut your stomach open. What
1963.20s: do you feel, David? Nothing.
1966.96s: Doctor, how do you feel all over? David,
1970.56s: I don't feel anything.
1972.88s: Doctor, what happened right after that?
1976.40s: Right after you came out of the
1977.68s: operating room, David, they just wheeled
1981.04s: me in and placed me on the bed, doctor.
1984.64s: And then what happened after that,
1987.12s: David?
1988.80s: Nothing,
1990.40s: doctor.
1992.32s: There is something happening.
1996.56s: David,
1999.28s: well, I went to sleep. Doctor, how did
2004.00s: you feel when you went to sleep?
2006.32s: David tired
2009.52s: doctor. All right. You slept for quite a
2012.48s: while. And what happens after that?
2015.04s: David. The next day, my parents come to
2017.76s: visit me, doctor.
2020.64s: And when did you get out of the
2022.16s: hospital? David. 4 days later. Doctor.
2026.96s: And how did you feel when you got out of
2028.72s: the hospital, David? My stomach hurt.
2031.84s: The psychologist again, in an attempt to
2034.24s: link David's hospital experience to his
2036.56s: physical examination aboard the UFO,
2039.12s: takes him back to the moment the alien
2041.44s: has given him an injection with a
2043.04s: needle.
2044.64s: Doctor,
2046.40s: and what goes on now, David?
2050.08s: Then they put my clothes on again. They
2052.48s: wheeled me out and they beamed me down.
2056.88s: Doctor, where did you get down, David?
2060.24s: in the empty lot. Doctor. All right,
2063.28s: David. Right before you saw the ship,
2065.92s: when you were in the empty lot, you're
2068.00s: going to be exactly the same way you
2069.76s: were before you saw the ship. Look
2071.68s: around you and tell me everything that
2074.32s: you see.
2076.16s: David,
2078.08s: I see my friend's house and the trees
2080.56s: around the lot and the roofs of some
2082.56s: houses, and there are street lights and
2085.28s: some old wrecked cars.
2087.68s: Doctor, just before you saw the ship,
2091.12s: what are you doing? David,
2094.48s: I'm walking.
2096.48s: Doctor, do you hear anything? David,
2099.84s: yes.
2101.68s: A high-pitched sound.
2104.24s: Doctor, can you imitate the sound for
2106.96s: us? David, no. Doctor, would you try?
2112.16s: David, it's too high. Doctor, what do
2115.68s: you do when you hear it?
2117.84s: David.
2119.36s: I look up and I see this great silverish
2123.20s: gray object. Doctor, how big is the
2126.16s: object, David? About as big as a house,
2130.00s: doctor. And how far is it off the
2131.84s: ground? David, about 30 to 40 ft.
2136.88s: Doctor, what do you notice about this
2138.88s: object, David? It has colored lights
2141.92s: around the middle which melt together.
2146.24s: Doctor, do you feel any wind? Any
2148.40s: vibration? David, just a wind. Doctor,
2153.44s: what reaction do you have? David,
2156.88s: I'm frightened.
2159.28s: Doctor, you ran. David, yes, but then
2163.60s: the beam shot down on me, doctor. And
2166.48s: what did the beam do when it shot down
2168.08s: at you, David? It brought me into the
2171.28s: ship.
2172.88s: Doctor, now I would like you to come
2174.96s: back to the time just before you see the
2176.88s: ship and just before you hear that
2178.48s: high-pitched sound. What are you doing?
2181.04s: How are you feeling? What are you
2183.12s: thinking?
2184.64s: David,
2186.40s: I was coming from my friend's house. I
2188.72s: felt great. I wasn't thinking about
2191.04s: nothing.
2192.72s: Doctor, now right after the beam has
2195.44s: pulled you up and everything, we're
2197.68s: right back and the object has
2199.36s: disappeared. Now, what's going on,
2201.92s: David? I start to run for home, doctor.
2206.24s: And how do you feel as you run home?
2208.80s: David, frightened.
2211.36s: Doctor,
2213.04s: is there any other feeling that you
2214.48s: have, David? I'm scared. Frightened. I
2218.88s: feel sort of numb. Doctor, where do you
2221.92s: feel numb? David, all over. Doctor, is
2226.00s: there any part of your body that feels
2228.24s: different from any other part of your
2229.92s: body? David? Yes. My head.
2236.56s: Doctor, how does your head feel, David?
2240.08s: Like it was twirling around, doctor.
2244.24s: How does this shoulder feel, David? It
2247.60s: doesn't hurt. Doctor, how does your
2250.64s: chest feel, David? Okay, doctor. How
2255.60s: does your tummy feel, David? Okay,
2259.92s: doctor.
2261.52s: And how do your legs feel, David? Numb.
2266.96s: Doctor, I'm going to wake you now.
2269.20s: You're back at the present. After you
2270.80s: wake up, you'll be wide awake. You'll be
2273.84s: alert. You'll feel confident. You'll
2275.92s: feel fine. All the hypnotic regression
2278.88s: sessions with David Seaw. Oh, we have a
2282.56s: name here. David Seawald.
2286.32s: All the hypnotic regression sessions
2288.00s: with David Seawald were videotaped, but
2290.80s: efforts to obtain copies or transcripts
2292.88s: of the experiment have been denied
2295.68s: because of the wrinkled orderly who
2297.36s: wheeled David into that hospital
2298.88s: operating room for an appendecttomy
2301.36s: years before. And because David equated
2303.76s: the room he was taken to on the craft as
2306.32s: an operating room, the psychologist felt
2309.04s: the problem was solved and David had
2311.60s: gone through some flashback which merged
2314.40s: with watching too many science fiction
2316.48s: TV shows.
2318.56s: I tend to I'm not going to agree wholly
2322.00s: with the psychologist's take, but I will
2325.84s: I do understand why one would as a
2329.36s: professional come to that conclusion.
2331.76s: Again, we talk about this idea of either
2334.64s: ignoring information, fitting it into
2337.36s: the current model, or expanding your
2339.28s: worldview. Those are the three options
2340.88s: when faced with these types of accounts.
2343.68s: Uh the first one obviously being off the
2345.68s: table, the second one being what we see
2348.16s: here. You know, finding those points of
2350.40s: connection to try and fit it into the
2352.56s: current model seems to be what most
2354.72s: people would do in this instance. And I
2356.64s: can't necessarily blame them. I think as
2359.04s: a professional if you're not aware of
2360.48s: this phenomenon and you've not looked
2362.48s: into it enough or you know studied the
2364.56s: works of you know people like John Mack
2366.48s: and Bud Hopkins etc. I don't think that
2369.28s: you be familiar with these cases enough
2371.84s: to expand your worldview. So I don't
2374.96s: blame the psychologists here for doing
2376.80s: that. The most recent inquiry about
2379.44s: those exceptional videotapes brought the
2381.60s: response that they had been erased.
2384.16s: There are far too many common
2385.44s: denominators between the David Seawald
2387.44s: experience and other contact kidnappings
2390.24s: to dismiss this significant case so
2392.72s: easily. The three aliens that approached
2395.84s: Argentine truck driverio
2398.64s: Lena in his early morning hours on
2401.36s: October 28th, 1973 as he attempted to
2404.80s: change a flat tire were definitely more
2407.60s: human and attractive than those
2409.84s: described by David Seaw. Still, Lanka
2412.80s: would have run if he could have. I I'm
2415.68s: not familiar with this case. Very
2417.20s: interesting. I'd like to hear more about
2418.96s: this. I I'm fascinated with the cases
2421.04s: of, you know, contact experiences that
2423.12s: involve beings that look like us. Well,
2425.68s: this might be really interesting to look
2426.96s: into. Can you give me a brief summary
2429.52s: about this man's interaction with these
2432.40s: beings and what exactly happened?
2435.68s: Sure. Dianio Lanca's encounter happened
2438.40s: in October 1973 when he was changing a
2441.28s: tire on his truck near Bajia Blanca,
2443.76s: Argentina. He described seeing a bright
2446.16s: light and then being approached by three
2448.32s: humanoid beings, two males and one
2450.24s: female, who had long blonde hair and
2452.72s: wore tight gray seats. He remembered
2454.96s: being paralyzed and then taken aboard a
2457.04s: saucer-shaped craft where they performed
2459.12s: some kind of procedure on him. He later
2461.12s: woke up several kilometers away,
2463.44s: confused and with partial amnesia. The
2466.32s: incident was investigated extensively
2468.32s: and it remains one of Argentina's most
2470.40s: well-known abduction stories.
2472.96s: Phenomenal. That is incredible. Um, I'm
2476.64s: I'm going to research that case a little
2478.32s: bit more. And again, just lovely to
2480.80s: hear. I mean, lovely to hear. It's
2482.56s: terrifying, but at the same time, it
2484.64s: it's good to hear corroborating evidence
2487.44s: that these things aren't just happening
2490.40s: locally in the United States. I have so
2492.80s: many books and magazines here that are
2494.72s: from all around the world. Every single
2496.48s: one of these is from like a different
2497.60s: part of the world that isn't like the
2498.96s: United States. And and so to anyone
2501.28s: thinking, "Oh, why is it always just the
2502.80s: US?" It really isn't. It really really
2505.20s: isn't. It's it across the board. It's
2508.80s: everywhere. Let's hear about Mr. Lanka's
2512.24s: case a little bit more here. It says, "I
2514.40s: break the truck on the shoulder, got
2516.88s: down, took out the jack and tools, and
2519.28s: began to change the tire." Lanka stated
2522.24s: after he regained his memory following 3
2524.32s: days of total amnesia, open quote, "The
2527.28s: road was completely deserted. All at
2529.36s: once, the road was illuminated with an
2531.52s: intense yellow light that seemed to be
2533.44s: about 2,000 m away. Because of the
2536.96s: color, I thought that they might be the
2540.24s: headlights of a pujo and continued my
2543.36s: work.
2545.04s: Pujo being a type of car. A few seconds
2548.64s: passed. Then the light became so bright
2551.36s: that it lit up the entire area. Now the
2554.96s: light had changed to a bluish color,
2556.88s: similar to an electric arc welder. I
2559.68s: tried to get up but could not rise. I
2562.00s: had no strength. And a strange thing, my
2564.96s: legs would not respond. Lanka turned
2567.76s: around to see a luminous great thing in
2570.40s: the form of a plate hovering nearby and
2573.60s: three people, two men and a woman,
2575.60s: dressed in silver suits with yellow
2577.60s: boots and gloves, standing next to him.
2580.80s: The trucker, totally paralyzed, watched
2583.20s: in horror as a strange apparatus was
2585.84s: held against his index finger. Lanka
2588.56s: believes he passed out immediately after
2590.40s: this. Later, he described their faces as
2594.16s: much like ours, except for high
2596.56s: foreheads and elongated eyes like the
2599.36s: Japanese and a little tilted.
2602.72s: Whoa, what an interesting what an
2606.32s: interesting thing. Were we looked at was
2608.64s: it Staffordshire? I can't particularly
2610.64s: remember the case, but this lady
2613.36s: allegedly saw beings wearing light blue
2617.04s: with golden hair, but she also said they
2619.76s: were beautiful. but had larger foreheads
2624.48s: and um they were uh they had beautiful
2627.04s: faces. I shall never forget their faces
2628.80s: as long as I live. Their foreheads seem
2631.36s: to be a bit larger than you know the the
2636.00s: bottom of their faces as as normal
2638.24s: people you would expect to see.
 So
2640.96s: again, just more corroborating evidence
2642.80s: of these Nordic humanoid type beings
2645.76s: existing. If we got one of you watching
2647.84s: out there, some type of hybrid Nordic
2649.84s: humanoid looking person,
2652.48s: find a way to get in touch with me. Get
2654.08s: your people to talk to my people. Let's
2655.84s: get you on the podcast once and for all.
2658.96s: Let's have a let's have a discussion.
2660.56s: I'm not opposed to this. I'm not I'm
2662.56s: just going to go out on a limb here and
2664.24s: say that I think
2667.68s: that the Area 52 YouTube channel should
2670.96s: host the very first conversation with a
2674.56s: Nordic being. And and and I'm I'm I'm
2677.76s: reaching out. If you're out there, if
2679.76s: this is real, if any of this is true, I
2682.40s: know you guys are probably hiding in the
2684.00s: shadows or hiding in plain sight or
2685.84s: whatever it is.
2688.16s: Figure it out. Talk amongst yourselves.
2690.48s: Maybe it's time, maybe it's time that we
2692.40s: have this discussion. So, you know, if
2695.12s: this is true, if this is real, figure
2696.96s: out a way to get in touch and let's have
2700.00s: this conversation. Let's stop
2701.36s: speculating. Let's talk to these,
2704.56s: you know, Nordic folk with the giant
2706.56s: foreheads and, you know, the big eyes.
2708.64s: Let's enough of this communicating with
2711.12s: government officials. Can we do away
2712.72s: with this, please?
2715.12s: Clearly,
2716.72s: you must be aware that our government
2718.24s: officials are completely incompetent and
2720.32s: they're solely hellbent and driven on
2723.68s: world destruction and money and greed.
2726.24s: Can we just focus on the people who
2730.56s: aren't the rest of us who are looking
2733.28s: for some type of converging event to
2736.56s: take place?
2739.28s: some type of unifying discussion with
2743.20s: non-human intelligence. Can this channel
2746.00s: be that vessel?
2749.84s: Why not? I don't see why not. I know
2753.12s: many of you are probably thinking,
2754.24s: "Well, Chris, you're off the rocker now.
2755.92s: You've completely lost it." And uh yeah,
2758.88s: you might be right. You might totally be
2760.72s: right. But I'm I'm going out on a limb
2762.64s: and I'm saying, "Why not? Why? Let's if
2764.64s: this is real and and you know I'm pretty
2766.64s: high conviction that some of this stuff
2768.00s: like people wouldn't just invent this
2770.32s: now. Okay, maybe there are some
2772.56s: psychological
2774.48s: events that happen that lead people to
2776.32s: believe that they're interacting with
2778.72s: aliens or spacemen or whatever it is.
2781.20s: Sure, I'm not going to rule that out
2783.84s: entirely. But if there's even a 1%
2787.04s: chance that this is real, let's have the
2789.92s: conversation.
2792.80s: Come on. What are you waiting for? And
2796.64s: it's not like if you come here that
2798.48s: everyone's going to believe you anyways.
2800.40s: If you are a hybrid or Nordic or
2802.80s: humanoid looking alien that's, you know,
2805.76s: curious to have a conversation and
2807.52s: curious to see what the audience will
2809.20s: say about it, come on down. I'll accept
2812.40s: you with open arms. Let's see what
2814.24s: happens. I digress. Moving on. Joe Bril,
2819.12s: international coordinator for the mutual
2820.96s: UFO network, MUON, followed up on the
2824.00s: intensive hypnotic regression sessions
2825.92s: of Donos Lanca. Present were
2828.48s: psychiatrists, psychologists, and a
2830.64s: hypnotist.
2832.56s: Sodium Pentathol was used in conjunction
2835.68s: with the hypnosis. Because of any lack
2837.84s: of contradictions in his story, as well
2840.16s: as their appraisals of the man, the
2841.92s: group felt Lanca was telling the truth.
2847.12s: In a drugged sleep, the truck driver
2849.36s: said he did not understand the language
2851.12s: spoken by the aliens. He compared it to
2853.60s: sounding like a hive of bees or a badly
2857.84s: tuned radio.
 I heard this terrific
2861.36s: noise. It was just like a giant cauldron
2864.48s: of water being poured onto a a fire, a
2867.76s: sort of noise, you know.
 Then he
2870.00s: remembered being carried aboard the
2871.52s: alien craft and climbing up with the two
2875.12s: men.
2877.52s: Interesting. Again, we're talking about
2879.04s: this buzzing.
2881.36s: I wonder if this is potentially a screen
2883.92s: memory to
2885.92s: perhaps mask the actual exchange of
2890.16s: information that was happening between
2891.60s: these beings. Uh, but then I'm also
2893.92s: reminded of Charles Hall and the Tall
2896.88s: Whites who said that they communicated
2899.20s: with this sort of high-pitched sound as
2901.76s: well. And also Whitley Strieber who
2904.48s: describes this
2906.08s: same thing that there's this sort of
2907.76s: like high-pitched sound that happens uh
2910.16s: during communication. So uh very
2912.32s: interesting.
2914.24s: Where are you climbing? Dr. Eduardo
2916.56s: Mattis asked. On a staircase.
2920.88s: No, along a ray of light, the trucker
2924.48s: responded. Charles Hixon and Calvin
2926.80s: Parker were also floated into a blue
2929.84s: glowing craft in the Pascula incident in
2932.64s: October 1973. a kidnapping which
2936.00s: attracted worldwide attention. Hixon
2938.64s: said the aliens which carried uh them
2940.72s: through the air to the ship were things.
2943.84s: He described them as having no apparent
2945.60s: eyes, a slit for a mouth, and wrinkled
2948.24s: skin, a little more metallic looking
2951.20s: than an elephant's. Calvin Parker
2954.56s: doesn't remember his physical
2956.08s: examination on the flying saucer because
2958.08s: he was unconscious after one look at the
2960.56s: beings.
2962.48s: There was no attempt at a conversation
2964.24s: other than a few weak murmurss of
2966.16s: protest from Hixon and a soft buzzing
2969.20s: sound in response from one of the
2971.04s: creatures. Still, another link with
2973.60s: David Seawald's description of monsters
2976.32s: occurred in Mexico during the summer of
2978.32s: 1972, where a mason and his assistant
2981.84s: were working on a clogged drain on the
2983.84s: second floor of a residence about at
2986.40s: about 2:00 p.m. This was reported in the
2989.20s: Appro Bulletin of December 1973.
2992.96s: The men heard a humming sound, which
2995.12s: they ignored, believing it to be a radio
2997.12s: tower in the vicinity.
3000.00s: Then they saw the two strange figures
3002.64s: floating towards them, dressed in bright
3005.68s: silvery clothing resembling fish scales.
3009.28s: "Those are masks, and they must be going
3012.32s: to a costume dance," thought Poncho
3014.96s: Torres. But as the 7-ft tall creature
3018.40s: came closer, the men got a better and
3020.96s: more frightening look. They were broad
3023.36s: men, much more so than usual, slender,
3026.80s: round heads, long and enlarged near the
3029.28s: chin, silverish in color, and very
3032.08s: bright with two round greenish bumps in
3034.40s: the place of eyes. Small ears, no
3037.28s: visible mouth or nose, pointyended hands
3041.28s: with four fingers, large webbed feet,
3044.16s: and they seem to float in the air.
3046.24s: Rayundo Alvarez was quoted as saying,
3049.36s: "During the same month and year of David
3051.60s: Seawald's experience, two Indians in
3054.48s: Idaho were having trouble with two
3056.80s: chirping aliens who wanted to converse
3059.12s: with them." Or so it seemed. As Willie
3062.32s: Beay and Guy TSI drove along Highway 26
3066.24s: near Riri in their old Buick sedan,
3069.92s: there was a sudden blinding flash of
3072.00s: light. The car stopped, although the
3073.92s: brakes had not been applied. A UFO
3076.32s: described as an object with green and
3078.08s: orange lights flashing through holes in
3080.00s: a ring around the rim hovered above
3082.00s: them. Two small figures could be seen
3084.40s: through a transparent dome on top. Then
3087.76s: the dome swung open and an occupant
3090.00s: moved toward the car with a sort of
3092.24s: floating movement.
3094.64s: A smaller variety of extraterrestrial
3096.72s: space voyager. This creature was
3098.40s: estimated at slightly over three feet
3100.88s: tall with large high ears, round eyes,
3104.88s: and a slit for a mouth. His face had a
3107.68s: rough look like scars, deep scars, said
3110.64s: one of the Indians. As the alien opened
3113.76s: the left door of the Buick, Guy Tossi
3116.24s: slid as far away from it as he could.
3120.48s: Then the car began moving on its own.
3123.20s: pulled or towed by some force emanating
3125.52s: from the craft when the car stopped some
3127.84s: 75 ft off the highway. Tossy opened the
3130.96s: door and ran for the nearest farmhouse.
3133.44s: The petrified Willie Beay was left alone
3136.32s: with the strange being who is making
3138.24s: rapid bird-like sounds. When Tossi
3141.44s: returned with the help, they found Beay
3143.92s: alone, sitting in the front seat with
3146.00s: his eyes tightly closed, a terrified,
3148.88s: trembling man. The car was still in the
3151.60s: field, but the craft was gone.
3155.04s: Now, this is really interesting as well.
3156.80s: Again, we hear these chirping birdlike
3160.64s: sounds which is mentioned by Whitley,
3163.04s: mentioned by
3164.96s: uh Charles Hull, but also the Ebo
3168.64s: molecular biologist when looking at the
3171.52s: lungs of these in individuals said that
3174.72s: they were more like bird sacks and that
3177.44s: the vibration of these sacks against the
3179.84s: diaphragm would create some type of
3183.28s: humming sound. I am fascinated. It seems
3186.24s: like we're dealing with a multiple array
3188.72s: of different species that all have
3190.80s: similarities.
3192.40s: Some of them look like us, some of them
3193.92s: don't, but they all seem to have this
3195.84s: sort of buzzing or high-pitched
3198.24s: communication ability.
3201.12s: I just don't know what to make of it.
3202.64s: Seems so strange. It does have the
3204.88s: makings for a spooky story. Aliens 7
3207.92s: feet tall, three feet tall, slit for
3210.24s: mouths, four fingers and webbed feet,
3212.32s: wrinkled, scarred, scaly skins, or space
3215.68s: suits, strange languages, and a
3218.00s: technology which utilizes some force to
3220.24s: compel, repel, and maintain a fixed
3223.20s: aerial position. Except in these and
3226.96s: many other contact cases on record, the
3229.76s: parallels and dissimilarities
3232.48s: only serve to prove that there is a type
3235.36s: of consistency.
3237.20s: The aliens superior technology and their
3240.24s: intent to examine the biological life on
3242.72s: this planet. Obviously, they are not of
3245.92s: this Earth and from their somewhat
3248.00s: varying descriptions have had different
3250.56s: evolutions and perhaps are coming from
3253.60s: different galaxies.
3255.52s: How much more might have been learned
3257.28s: about David Seawald's monsters or their
3260.16s: craft had a more open-minded approach
3262.64s: been taken during those hypnotic
3264.24s: sessions?
3265.76s: If other specialists had been present,
3267.76s: even space technologists or propulsion
3270.08s: experts, who would know the right
3272.48s: questions to ask, what other secrets
3274.96s: might have been uncovered from that
3276.72s: locked door in David's mind?
3279.52s: Shall we treat the next witness brave
3281.52s: enough to admit he or she has been taken
3283.52s: aboard a flying saucer or fortunate
3285.68s: enough to remember like he's been
3287.68s: watching too many Star Trek reruns?
3290.88s: David Seaw Walt, now soft-spoken young
3293.12s: man of 20, still sticks by his story,
3296.24s: and no detail of that vivid experience
3298.40s: has changed. So, hold on. He was 20 in
3300.56s: 1976, which makes him considerably
3302.64s: older. Uh, yeah, he might be around 71
3305.12s: now. I guess he has no recurrent
3307.52s: nightmares nor suffered any adverse
3309.68s: physical effects from the encounter.
3311.92s: There have been no attempts at
3313.36s: telepathic communication by the alien,
3315.44s: as sometimes occurs in contact cases.
3318.72s: Bill Allen, who investigated the case,
3321.28s: does not agree with the psychologist's
3322.96s: conclusion that David's experience was
3324.56s: one born out of some flashback to his
3327.36s: appendecttomy operation. I find it
3330.32s: rather hard to accept this easy
3331.84s: explanation, having witnessed David's
3333.44s: reactions and obvious terror during the
3335.84s: hypnotic regressions, he states.
3340.16s: No matter how terrifying or bizarre the
3342.56s: circumstances, the subconscious mind
3345.12s: records all it has seen. Perhaps in
3348.16s: response to the right questions from
3349.92s: specialists without preconceived ideas
3352.24s: against the possibility of alien
3353.84s: visitation, we may solve the mystery of
3356.16s: the flying saucer from the minds of UFO
3360.08s: contactees.
3363.20s: What a phenomenal little read through
3365.68s: that was. Absolutely fantastic. With
3368.72s: each and every story that I read
3370.72s: through, my conviction level jumps by
3373.04s: maybe a fraction of a percentage.
3377.12s: It isn't so much the exact description
3380.32s: of the aliens that makes it more
3382.24s: convincing to me, but it's the sheer
3385.12s: number of reports and and as stated by
3387.92s: the author of this article. Sure, the
3391.04s: skin might be different, the description
3392.88s: of the eyes, the beings themselves, the
3395.12s: the language they use or the technology
3397.92s: that they're using might vary, but there
3401.04s: is a consistent
3403.04s: throughine here, and that is that
3404.80s: they're happening. This exists. This is
3406.72s: happening to these people.
3409.44s: Every case that we read through
3412.96s: in this last hour happened within a 2 or
3416.72s: threeear period in the 1970s.
3419.76s: And there's so so many more. It's it's
3422.72s: not for nothing that I come back to that
3424.40s: over and over again. You know,
3427.04s: it might be easy to dismiss one case or
3429.36s: two cases, but when it jumps into the
3431.76s: thousands, and these cases are by a
3434.32s: varying amount of people from a varied
3437.12s: amount of professions and backgrounds,
3440.64s: like the the two plumbers there, or just
3442.88s: some guy jacking his car up because his
3445.36s: tire was flat. Like, these aren't people
3448.72s: who are
3450.64s: I can't say for sure, but it doesn't
3452.08s: seem like these are people who are just
3453.28s: completely unhinged. And for the most
3455.28s: part, they have nothing to gain from it
3456.56s: and everything to lose. Especially at a
3459.20s: time where scrutiny was at a all-time
3461.36s: high and people would be really quick to
3464.08s: either dismiss you or to categorize you
3465.84s: as an absolute loon. It just makes it
3469.20s: that much more convincing.
3472.80s: You know,
3476.00s: I'll tell you something.
3479.12s: Uh something that happened to me
3480.32s: actually last night.
3483.84s: um wasn't sure if I was going to talk
3485.84s: about this or if I was ever going to
3487.28s: bring it up, but I I think it deserves
3489.68s: to be
3491.68s: mentioned.
3494.32s: Um I was talking to my father last night
3498.80s: and my father is he's not one to
3502.32s: speculate on this stuff. He's got a
3503.92s: really hard time, you know, I talk to
3505.52s: him about this stuff. He watches some of
3506.88s: the videos, but he's he's always like,
3508.16s: "I don't don't really buy it." you know,
3511.68s: I can't blame him.
3514.64s: And
3517.04s: I was talking about abductions. I was
3518.88s: talking about, I think, John Max's work.
3522.08s: And
3525.28s: he goes,
3527.68s: "You know, I have a story
3531.20s: and maybe one day I'll tell you about
3533.44s: it."
3536.08s: Immediately piqu my interest. I'm like,
3537.52s: "Wait,
3539.28s: what?"
3540.80s: Um, so I I prompted I said, "Can you can
3543.44s: you tell me now?" And he said, "Sure."
3545.76s: And he was incredibly reluctant. Um,
3551.20s: yeah, if you knew my father, you would
3552.88s: understand. Like, he's just not the type
3554.88s: to bring stuff like this up or to
3558.24s: entertain it whatsoever.
3561.04s: Highly skeptical guy. But he said that
3563.84s: when he was around 10 years old, he was
3566.64s: delivering newspapers and it was
3568.00s: somewhere in Montreal. Newspapers or
3570.00s: flyers, I can't remember. And it was
3574.40s: broad daylight in the afternoon,
3576.08s: beautiful day outside.
3578.48s: And he goes into one of these apartment
3580.88s: buildings to drop off the flyers.
3584.08s: He does that. And when he comes back
3586.08s: outside, it is now nighttime,
3591.52s: not evening. This is summer. This is
3594.00s: nighttime. The stars are out. Probably
3596.32s: well past 10 p.m. Now, as a 10-year-old
3599.36s: boy,
3601.76s: he would not be allowed to be out that
3604.08s: late. You know, he was swiftly
3605.92s: reprimanded from my grandfather uh upon
3609.04s: entering his home because he could not
3612.80s: account for his missing time or where he
3615.52s: had been. His father had asked him,
3617.52s: "Where were you?" to which my dad
3619.76s: responded,
3622.24s: "I don't know.
3625.36s: It was the afternoon
3627.84s: and then when he came back outside it
3629.44s: was the night."
3632.96s: My dad had never even told my mom that
3635.04s: story.
3637.28s: And so
3639.20s: I just found it, you know, it's one of
3642.48s: those things that for me incredibly high
3645.52s: conviction on that on something like
3647.84s: that. you know, it's not something
3649.28s: that's not something you're likely to
3651.28s: forget is an event like that. And um
3656.32s: yeah, I was just I'm really thankful
3658.00s: that my dad, you know, decided to share
3659.84s: that story with me. So, Dad, if you're
3662.40s: watching, thanks for thanks for sharing
3664.72s: that. And I know it takes a lot to be
3666.32s: open and vulnerable with this type of
3668.16s: stuff. So, I appreciate it. And I
3671.12s: appreciate everyone who does come
3672.96s: forward with these stories, often
3675.68s: stranger than fiction.
3678.72s: As we all move forward into this new
3680.72s: paradigm which is whimsical and
3683.04s: wonderful. Uh
3685.84s: I want to encourage all of you to
3687.68s: suspend your disbelief when hearing
3689.04s: these things. Keep an open heart and an
3691.84s: open mind when listening to people who
3693.20s: have something important to tell you.
3695.04s: Let's encourage more of these stories to
3696.56s: come out and create a judgment-free
3699.28s: environment for these people to express
3701.60s: themselves in. Thank you everybody for
3703.92s: watching. I appreciate you guys. And uh
3706.56s: we got a very special episode next week.
3708.64s: We got a guest. We're hopping back into
3710.16s: skiff. Uh I think you're really going to
3712.24s: enjoy this one.
3714.32s: We'll see you then. Peace and love.
3718.33s: [Music]
