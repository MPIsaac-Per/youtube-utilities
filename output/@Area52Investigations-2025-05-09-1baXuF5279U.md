2.84s: 2011. I'm driving to my apartment from
6.24s: my girlfriend's parents house. Me and my
8.52s: girlfriend are on her way home. She
11.44s: starts screaming. Next thing I know, I'm
14.88s: looking at a bright orange thing
17.12s: punching its way into the atmosphere. I
19.60s: say to myself in my head, "That's got to
21.44s: be a meteor." It arrow breaks to a stop
25.60s: a thousand meters above my head. At
27.92s: which point I freak the out. This thing
30.08s: is stationary. It's orange. It's
32.08s: glowing. It's on fire. It's transparent.
34.88s: The next thing it does is rock it off at
38.64s: a 90° angle. When I say 90°, I mean like
42.32s: dead square. This scared the freaking
45.92s: hell out of me. Anyway, that's my
48.40s: experience. Have a good day.
52.16s: Ladies and
53.48s: gentlemen, my name is Chris Ramsey and
56.56s: welcome back to another episode of
59.08s: Debriefed. Today is yet
62.52s: another beginning of a document
65.76s: readthrough. This document, however, is
67.68s: fascinating. I'm completely enamored by
69.92s: this story. Is it true? Is it not true?
72.48s: Who knows? Maybe we'll find out. But we
74.16s: are guaranteed to have a good time
76.08s: reading through it. So before we get
78.16s: started folks, you know, leave a like,
81.08s: subscribe, hit the notification bell if
83.76s: you like videos like these document
86.00s: readthroughs, and especially these alien
89.64s: interactions. This is something I'm
91.44s: fascinated by. Uh I think even more so
93.52s: than the UFO topic. You know, always
95.68s: feels good to have great guests in the
97.36s: skiff and learn from these amazingly,
99.92s: you know, talented individuals and
101.60s: individuals with interesting backgrounds
103.36s: and stories and history. But every now
105.76s: and then, I got to tell you, there is
108.72s: nothing I enjoy more than sitting here
111.92s: with some questionable documents, a cup
114.72s: of Joe, and you
116.60s: guys. Also, hats are back in stock. I
119.52s: know a lot of you have been asking about
120.80s: the black snapbacks and the trucker
122.64s: hats. Those are back in stock. We're
124.16s: trying to replenish the store, but you
125.68s: guys keep buying everything up, so not a
129.04s: bad problem to have. But yeah, we
130.40s: restocked some hats until the next
132.24s: collection drops. So feel free to head
133.68s: over to
134.84s: area52.shop to check those out. And
138.08s: right before we begin, a quick word from
140.40s: our
145.64s: sponsors inside this skiff. We work in a
148.32s: world built on prevention. We don't wait
150.80s: for leaks to happen. We don't wait for
152.80s: breaches. We plan ahead. Because when it
155.68s: comes to sensitive information, reacting
157.52s: too late isn't an option. But here's the
160.16s: truth. Your personal data deserves the
162.24s: same mindset. Data brokers are
164.24s: constantly collecting and selling your
165.92s: details. Even if no breach has happened
168.00s: yet. And once that data is out there,
169.84s: guess what? Well, it's almost impossible
172.24s: to pull back. That's why I use Incogn.
175.28s: You see, Incogn doesn't just clean up
176.80s: the past. It actively reduces your
179.12s: future risk. With one authorization,
181.68s: they reach out to dozens, sometimes
183.68s: hundreds of data brokers and force them
185.84s: to delete your private information
188.08s: legally, efficiently, and quietly. The
191.84s: fewer hands your data passes through,
193.68s: the less chance it ends up where it
195.04s: shouldn't. Go to
197.08s: incogn.com/eraf52 and use code area52 to
199.84s: get 60% off your annual plan. We secure
203.76s: the future inside the skiff. It's time
206.32s: to secure yours, too. All right, folks.
209.44s: We paid the bills. This transcript is an
212.72s: excerpt from a book, a book published by
215.84s: Lawrence R. Spencer, who has sadly
217.84s: passed a few years ago. So, I would
220.32s: highly, highly encourage all of those
222.64s: watching, if you want to get the full
224.56s: story, as I will not be reading the
226.40s: entire book, please head over to the
229.12s: website. I've linked it below. Purchase
230.80s: it for yourself to support, you know,
232.64s: his estate or his family and have a look
234.96s: for yourself and so you don't miss any
236.56s: of the details. So, in the first
238.32s: chapter, Lawrence recounts his contact
241.36s: with Miss Mroy, a woman who claimed to
243.76s: have ties to the 1947 Roswell incident
247.04s: in New Mexico. She said she refused to
248.96s: discuss it because her life depended on
250.56s: it. And once in 1988, Lawrence was able
253.20s: to allegedly speak to this lady on the
255.60s: phone. This is when she lived in
257.60s: Glasgow, Montana. Uh he later received a
260.88s: handwritten letter from her in Ireland
262.72s: referencing his book. But when he tried
264.88s: to contact her at the return address,
266.96s: the homeowner informed him that Mrs.
269.44s: Mroy and her husband had recently
272.28s: deceased and were buried locally.
275.20s: However, despite this, he could not find
278.24s: any official records of her existence
281.76s: under any name. So, did she give a
284.32s: pseudonym to, you know, the landlord and
287.20s: to uh Lawrence Spencer? Quite possible.
290.40s: Um, but it does lead us to suspect that
293.28s: either this is made up or the government
295.76s: simply, you know, erased her identity as
298.32s: part of the cover up. Your guess is as
300.40s: good as mine. But that is where we
302.64s: begin. August 12th in 2007, this is the
305.44s: letter from Mrs. Maroy. Dear Lawrence, I
308.64s: am typing this letter to you on my old
310.48s: Underwood typewriter that I bought after
312.16s: I was discharged from the army. Somehow
314.64s: it seems like a fitting contrast to the
316.48s: subject of this letter and the documents
318.48s: you will find enclosed in the envelope.
320.32s: The last time I spoke to you was about 8
322.00s: years ago. During your brief telephone
323.76s: interview uh with me, you asked me to
325.68s: assist you with the research of the Oz
327.68s: Factors book you were writing because
329.28s: you suspected that I might know
330.72s: something that would help your
331.76s: investigation into the possibility that
333.36s: extraterrestrial beings may have
335.36s: influenced the history of Earth. When we
337.84s: spoke, I told you that I did not have
340.00s: any information that I could share with
341.36s: you about anything. Okay, pause.
343.84s: Important to note that the author,
346.00s: Lawrence R. Spencer, is indeed also a
349.36s: fictional author who writes about
351.68s: aliens. Okay, know a lot of you, this is
354.24s: where you check out. This is where you
355.84s: go, well, I mean, that sums it up. This
360.32s: guy writes books about aliens and all of
362.40s: a sudden he gets some lady who says she
365.76s: spoke to an alien and he has the
367.60s: transcripts and no one else does.
370.64s: seems suspicious. Absolutely. And I I
373.44s: concur. It is
374.84s: suspicious. It's not going to stop me
377.28s: from
378.28s: listening because let's say that what
381.04s: he's saying is true. Then I think that
382.64s: this is very important. I think that the
385.28s: uh level of importance currently
388.36s: outweighs the possibility that this
391.80s: isn't
393.40s: legitimate. So, we must continue for our
396.96s: research to read on. Also, this isn't
399.36s: new. You know, Whitley Strieber as well
401.76s: uh is has written many um science
405.04s: fiction or or sorry fictional uh books
408.16s: but is also as as you know uh allegedly
412.00s: been abducted by aliens. Also Nick Pope
415.20s: who worked for the Ministry of Defense
418.32s: in the UK at the UFO desk nearly 21
421.68s: years at the ministry also wrote science
424.96s: fiction books. So, is there a pattern
427.52s: that leads these people to the
430.32s: phenomenon or are all these people just
433.48s: simply trying to make a bag? You know,
437.20s: that's really up to you to decide. And
438.96s: then I'm sure they've dealt with those
440.40s: criticisms as well. But again, we carry
442.32s: on. Since then, I've read your book and
444.00s: found it very interesting and
445.04s: compelling. Now, I'm not going to read
447.36s: the entire letter of Miss Maroy because
450.16s: I don't think it's pertinent. And I
452.08s: think again if you want to read the
453.20s: entire uh letter you can go ahead and
455.12s: buy the book. I'm going to give you a
457.28s: few footnotes here that are uh rather
459.60s: pertinent and then we're going to get
461.24s: into the interaction with the being. So
464.00s: essentially she reconsidered her
466.08s: position about not coming forward and
468.64s: not giving him any details or helping
472.08s: him out with you know his book. And now
474.72s: she's like well maybe maybe I will tell
477.20s: you actually what went on. She goes on
479.92s: saying that many men have been killed to
481.92s: extinguish the possibility of revealing
483.84s: the knowledge that she has helped to
486.00s: withhold from society. But at this
487.92s: point, she's 83 years old. And she says,
489.92s: "Here, I've decided to leave this body
492.24s: which has outlasted its usefulness to me
494.24s: using a painless method of
495.56s: self-administered
497.40s: euthanasia. I have very few months to
499.52s: live and nothing to fear or lose." And
503.20s: she goes on talking about fairy mounds
506.32s: and hills of terra and the great mound
509.04s: like the pyramids and all of this
511.60s: actually ends up relating back to her
513.76s: relationship with the extraterrestrial
515.84s: and the information that was provided to
517.60s: her. So very fascinating stuff. But
519.68s: here's the reason why she comes forward
521.20s: with this. She says, "The crystal clear
522.56s: perspective of hindsight has revealed a
524.80s: higher purpose to me. Assisting the
526.32s: survival of the planet, all living
527.84s: beings and life forms in our galaxy. The
530.72s: status quo of our government
531.84s: establishment has been to protect the
533.44s: people from knowledge of such matters.
535.68s: In fact, the only protection afforded by
538.00s: ignorance and secrecy is to hide the
539.68s: private agenda of those in power to
541.44s: enslave others and by doing so to disarm
545.20s: every perceived enemy and ally through
547.76s: superstition and
550.52s: stupidity. Them's fighting words.
553.32s: Matilda. Matilda's had enough. Now, I am
556.32s: entrusting these documents to your
557.60s: discretion to impart to the world in any
560.24s: form or matter you see fit. My only
562.88s: request is that you do so in a way that
564.80s: will not threaten your own life or
566.40s: well-being if possible. If you were to
569.28s: incorporate these notes of my experience
570.88s: into a work of fiction, such as a novel,
573.12s: the factual nature of the material could
575.04s: be easily dismissed or discredited by
577.04s: agency for whom national security is
579.28s: used as a personal shield against
580.48s: scrutiny and justice.
582.48s: In so doing, you could disavow any
584.88s: knowledge of their true origin and claim
586.88s: that it is fictitious work of your
589.16s: imagination. Whoever said that truth is
591.28s: stranger than fiction was right as
593.88s: rain. For most people, all of this will
596.48s: be unbelievable. Unfortunately, beliefs
598.32s: are not a reliable criteria for
601.24s: reality. I agree with that. Well said.
604.80s: Just because you believe something does
606.80s: not make it so. All right, let's get to
608.48s: the meat and bones here. As you know,
610.60s: 1947 July, the Roswell Army Airfield
614.16s: issued a press release stating that
616.00s: personnel from the field's 509th bomb
618.48s: group had recovered a crashed flying
620.80s: disc from a ranch near Roswell, New
623.28s: Mexico, sparking intense media interest
626.08s: to say the least. Later that same day,
629.36s: the commanding general of the 8th Air
631.20s: Force stated that Major Jesse Marcel,
633.92s: who was involved with the original
635.36s: recovery of the debris, had recovered
636.96s: only tattered remnants of a weather
639.36s: balloon. The true facts of the incident
641.44s: have been suppressed by the United
642.88s: States government since then. Now, we
644.56s: know this to be true because Jesse
645.84s: Marcel also came forward later in his
648.00s: life prior to his death uh stating that
650.32s: yeah, there was a cover up and the
652.40s: materials that they had were not the
654.48s: weather balloon stuff. And they were
656.00s: told, he was told to basically pose with
658.88s: this ridiculous, you know, balsa wood
661.44s: and and and weather balloon debris. All
664.32s: I could do is keep a mouth shut. And
667.52s: General Ramy is the one who told the
669.52s: newspapers what it was and forget about
672.40s: it. It was nothing more than a weather
675.20s: observation balloon. Of course, which we
678.00s: we both knew differently. Now, she goes
679.84s: on to say that she was enlisted in the
681.20s: US Army Air Force uh women's US Army Air
684.40s: Force Medical Corps, which was a part of
686.48s: the US Army back then, and she was
688.56s: assigned to the 509th bomb group as a
690.88s: flight nurse at the time of the
692.88s: incident. When the news that there had
694.72s: been a crash was received at the base, I
696.40s: was asked to accompany Mr. Cavitt, the
697.92s: counter intelligence officer, to the
699.52s: crash site as the driver of his vehicle
702.56s: and to render any needed emergency
704.64s: medical assistance to any survivors if
706.80s: necessary. Therefore, I briefly
709.36s: witnessed the wreckage of an alien
710.80s: spacecraft as well as the remains of
712.56s: several alien personnel aboard the craft
714.40s: who were already dead. When we arrived,
716.96s: I learned that one of the personnel on
718.56s: board the craft had survived the crash.
721.36s: And this is something that's come up, by
723.36s: the way, in UFO lore. That some people
726.24s: say, "Oh, no, all the bodies were dead."
727.92s: And then other people say, "No, there
729.52s: was a single survivor." And this is
732.72s: about that sole survivor. Uh so this
735.12s: being was conscious and apparently
736.56s: uninjured. that the conscious alien was
738.24s: similar in appearance in appearance but
740.24s: not the same as the
743.00s: others. Huh. None of the other personnel
746.32s: present could communicate with the
747.92s: survivor as the being did not
749.68s: communicate verbally or by any
751.84s: recognizable signs. However, while I
754.96s: examined the patient for injuries, I
756.56s: immediately detected and understood that
758.96s: the alien being was attempting to
760.80s: communicate with me by mental images or
763.68s: telepathic thought which projected
766.68s: directly from the mind of the
770.20s: being. I immediately reported this
772.56s: phenomenon to Mr. Cavitt as no other
774.32s: person present could perceive these
775.76s: thoughts and the alien seemed able and
778.32s: willing to communicate with me. It was
780.72s: decided after a brief consultation with
782.80s: a senior officer that I would accompany
785.12s: the surviving alien back to the base.
788.08s: Can you
789.24s: imagine being a nurse? First of all, all
792.00s: right, there's a wreckage or something.
793.52s: Whoa, what is that being? Boom, boom,
795.20s: boom. All of a sudden, you're getting
796.40s: images in your head, flashes of
798.44s: messages, seeing this body, seeing this
800.96s: being alive, and you're like, "What the
802.56s: heck is going on?" And imagine Lawrence
805.36s: R. Spencer, the author, reading this
808.08s: note, getting this letter, and being
810.16s: like, "Holy cow." By the way, if
813.12s: anyone's out there who has a similar
814.64s: story, please send it my way. Figure out
817.12s: a way to get in contact with me, maybe
818.72s: through Discord, and I would happily
820.80s: read your letter as well. This was
822.96s: partly due to the fact that I was a
824.48s: nurse and could attend to the physical
826.08s: needs of the alien as well as serve as a
827.60s: non-threatening communicator and
829.08s: companion. So, she was designated the
831.76s: companion to the uh to the alien. uh
834.48s: being a nurse, she could be trusted um
838.56s: to tend to the alien should it need any
841.16s: medical uh attention. She says, "My duty
843.92s: was to communicate with and interview
846.24s: the alien and to make a complete report
848.16s: of all that I discovered to command
850.16s: authorities. Subsequently, I was
852.24s: supplied with specific lists of
855.20s: questions provided to me by military and
857.04s: non-military personnel, which I was to
858.96s: interpret for the alien and record the
861.20s: responses to the questions provided. I
863.92s: also accompanied the alien at all times
865.92s: during medical testing and the many
868.16s: other examinations to which the alien
869.92s: was subjected by staff from numerous
871.76s: government agencies. As you can
874.60s: imagine, especially back then, yeah,
876.88s: there would be a lot of testing going
878.16s: on. Poor thing. She says, "I was given a
881.44s: promotion in rank to senior master
883.20s: sergeant to approve my security rating
885.20s: and to increase my pay grade from $54 a
887.84s: month to 138 a month." Wow, that's a big
890.88s: increase.
892.48s: Uh for this very unusual assignment, I
894.56s: performed these duties from July 7th
896.16s: through to August 1947, at which time
898.96s: the alien died or departed the body, as
902.48s: you will read about in my notes.
904.40s: Although I was never left entirely alone
906.24s: with the alien, as there were always
908.32s: military personnel, intelligence agency
910.56s: people, and a variety of other officials
912.56s: present from time to time, I did have
915.44s: uninterrupted access to the to and
918.16s: communication with the alien being for
920.48s: nearly six weeks. It's a long time. Here
925.28s: and after is an interview and summary of
927.28s: my personal recollections of
928.80s: conversations in quotes with the alien
931.12s: craft pilot whom I came to know by the
934.88s: identity of
937.56s: a i
939.96s: ler. I feel that it is my duty at this
943.20s: time in the best interest of the
944.96s: citizens of Earth to reveal what I have
947.28s: learned from my interaction with Arrol
949.68s: during those six
951.08s: weeks on the anniversary of her death or
954.72s: departure 60 years ago. Wow. Her death.
957.12s: Okay. So, so according to Matilda, this
959.28s: is a female entity. Very interesting.
961.36s: Although I served as a nurse in the Army
963.04s: Air Force, I am not a pilot or
965.44s: technician. Further, I did not have any
967.76s: direct contact with the spacecraft or
969.84s: other materials recovered from the crash
971.60s: site at the time or thereafter. To that
974.16s: degree, it must be taken into
975.68s: consideration that my understanding of
977.20s: the communications I had with Aerrol are
979.68s: based on my own subjective ability to
983.12s: interpret the meaning of the thoughts
984.72s: and mental images I was able to
987.56s: perceive. Fascinating. Our
990.08s: communications did not consist of spoken
992.64s: language in the conventional sense.
995.44s: Indeed, the body of the alien had no
999.08s: mouth through which to
1001.40s: speak.
1004.28s: Whoa, that's crazy and
1007.40s: creepy. So, we're not thinking skinny
1009.84s: Bob here. We're not thinking um there is
1012.64s: an image,
1014.44s: however. This is interesting. UAP Juan
1017.60s: shared this a few days ago on his
1019.84s: Twitter account, and these were
1021.52s: apparently leaked images of
1025.84s: alien
1028.12s: beings. So creepy, by the way. All
1030.80s: right, so do not look at this if you're
1033.68s: easily creeped out, but these things are
1035.20s: creepy as f. And you'll notice, and this
1038.80s: is one thing I noticed, they do not
1040.72s: perceive to have any mouths. And one of
1044.24s: them is wearing like some type of
1050.52s: cloak. Is this one of the beings that
1054.48s: Matilda communicated
1056.44s: with? Very interesting. Our
1058.80s: communication was by telepathy. At
1060.96s: first, I could not understand Arrol very
1063.28s: clearly. I could perceive images,
1065.44s: emotions, and impressions, but it was
1067.92s: difficult for me to express these
1069.64s: verbally. Once Arrol learned the English
1072.44s: language, she was able to focus her
1074.80s: thoughts more precisely using symbols
1076.88s: and meanings of words I could
1078.40s: understand. Learning the English
1080.24s: language was done as a favor to me. It
1083.36s: was more for my own benefit than hers.
1086.80s: Whoa. We taught this alien English.
1088.96s: Okay. By the end of our interview
1091.20s: sessions, and increasingly since then,
1093.52s: I've become more comfortable with
1094.96s: telepathic communication. I've become
1097.60s: more adept at understanding Arrol's
1100.40s: thoughts as though they are my own.
1102.88s: Somehow, her thoughts become my
1104.84s: thoughts. Her emotions are my emotions.
1109.20s: However, this is limited by her
1110.80s: willingness and intention to share her
1113.28s: own personal universe with me. She's
1116.80s: able to be selective about what
1118.56s: communication I am allowed to receive
1120.48s: from her. Likewise, her experience,
1122.88s: training, education, relationships, and
1125.52s: purpose are uniquely her
1127.96s: own. Whoa. See, this is a really
1131.04s: interesting thought for me because when
1132.96s: we think about telepathy or we think
1134.96s: about sharing some type of intelligent
1137.68s: consciousness, we automatically assume
1139.84s: that all thoughts are everybody's and
1141.68s: everybody agrees and it's this hive mind
1144.08s: sort of collective when in
1145.80s: reality we do apparently transfer
1149.56s: thought, but that doesn't really
1152.48s: eliminate uniqueness somehow.
1154.88s: Individuality still persists to a
1157.36s: certain extent.
1159.20s: That's really interesting. This is the
1161.36s: symbol of the domain. The domain is a
1165.52s: race or civilization of which Aerrol,
1168.08s: the alien I interviewed, is an officer,
1170.64s: pilot, and engineer serving in the
1173.20s: domain expeditionary
1175.80s: force. The symbol represents the origin
1178.64s: and unlimited boundary of the known
1180.72s: universe, united and integrated into a
1184.56s: vast civilization under the control of
1187.76s: the domain.
1190.08s: Now, is it literally the domain or is
1192.48s: this just like an interpretation of the
1194.80s: word domain? Who knows? Errol is
1197.60s: currently stationed at a base in the
1199.52s: asteroid belt, which she refers as a
1202.48s: space station in the solar system of
1204.92s: Earth. First and foremost, Arrol is
1208.52s: herself. Secondarily, she voluntarily
1211.76s: serves as an officer, pilot, and
1214.00s: engineer in the domain expeditionary
1216.00s: force. In that capacity, she has duties
1218.64s: and responsibilities, but she is at
1220.72s: leave to come and go as she pleases.
1223.40s: Also, please accept this material and
1226.32s: make it known to as many people as
1228.24s: possible. I repeat that this is not my
1230.32s: intention to endanger your life with the
1232.32s: possession of this material, nor do I
1234.96s: really expect you to believe any of it
1237.68s: either. However, I do sense that you can
1240.96s: appreciate the value that such knowledge
1243.20s: may have to those who are willing and
1245.12s: able to face the reality of it. Mankind
1248.40s: needs to know the answers to questions
1249.92s: which are contained in these documents.
1251.52s: Who are we? Where do we come from? What
1254.08s: is our purpose on Earth? Is mankind
1256.32s: alone in the universe? If there is
1258.64s: intelligent life elsewhere, why have
1260.88s: they not contacted us? It is vital that
1263.52s: people understand the devastating
1265.04s: consequences to our spiritual and
1267.20s: physical survival if we fail to take
1269.52s: effective action to undo longstanding
1271.84s: and pervasive effects of alien
1273.68s: intervention on Earth. Perhaps the
1276.00s: information in these documents will
1277.36s: serve as a stepping stone to a better
1279.44s: future for mankind. I hope that you can
1281.20s: be more clever, creative, and courageous
1282.88s: in the distribution of this information
1284.64s: than I have been. May the gods bless you
1288.08s: and keep you. This is Matildo Donald
1290.16s: Mroy.
1292.40s: I mean, this is truly truly fascinating,
1296.24s: folks. You know what the requirements
1297.52s: are here. Suspend your disbelief. Check
1299.60s: it at the door. You know, belief often
1301.44s: gets in the way of a good story. And all
1304.16s: too many times, especially in the UFO
1307.28s: sphere, I will say, we often get carried
1311.04s: away by focusing on the wrong things,
1313.80s: by denying evidence prior to even
1318.16s: absorbing it based on a worldview that
1321.44s: has already been ingrained and cemented
1323.76s: in our psyche. To willingly suspend your
1326.48s: disbelief in order to absorb information
1330.00s: is a skill. a skill that I'm sure that
1332.56s: you all possess to deny
1335.48s: information and ridicule it outright
1338.24s: prior to absorbing the information. This
1340.96s: makes you an accomplice to the cover up.
1343.60s: Intaking information does not mean
1345.92s: having to believe it. Whether true,
1348.32s: whether lies, it is still information.
1351.44s: And if you find
1352.84s: yourself in the face of new information
1356.32s: that seems a little unbelievable, unable
1358.80s: to absorb this information due to any
1361.76s: pre-existing bias that you may have
1364.80s: inherited through the few decades that
1367.04s: you've been on this planet, then I
1369.92s: highly suggest to
1372.04s: practice suspending your disbelief. Keep
1374.96s: your conviction low when it comes to
1376.56s: this information. Do not believe it
1378.16s: outright, but do take it in. Only then
1381.20s: will you be able to make connections
1383.28s: through this and maybe weed
1386.44s: out the possible truth that lies within
1390.56s: these documents. There might be one
1392.48s: piece of information here that connects
1395.12s: to something that you already know and
1397.44s: that might unlock an entire new reality
1400.00s: for
1401.08s: you or not. Either way, let's have fun.
1405.44s: So this is the first interview with uh
1408.72s: the alien. Matilda writes, "By the time
1411.28s: the alien had been returned to the base,
1413.44s: I had already spent several hours with
1415.12s: her. Now, as I mentioned, Mr. Cav had
1416.88s: told me to stay with the alien since I
1418.48s: was the only person among us who could
1420.88s: understand her communication. I could
1423.76s: not understand my ability to communicate
1425.68s: with the being. I had never before that
1427.76s: time experienced telepathic
1429.04s: communication with anyone. The
1431.04s: non-verbal communication I experienced
1432.80s: was like the understanding you might
1434.88s: have when a child or a dog is trying to
1437.36s: get you to understand something but much
1439.68s: much more direct and powerful. Even
1442.56s: though there were no words spoken or
1444.80s: signs made, the intention of the
1446.56s: thoughts were unmistakable to me. I
1449.20s: realized later that although I received
1451.12s: the thought, I did not necessarily
1453.20s: interpret its meaning exactly. I think
1456.16s: that the alien being was not willing to
1457.84s: discuss technical matters due to the
1459.44s: nature of her position as an officer and
1461.12s: a pilot with a duty to maintain the
1462.88s: security and confidentiality required by
1464.80s: her own unit or organization. Any
1468.08s: soldier who is captured by the enemy in
1469.84s: the line of duty has a responsibility to
1471.76s: withhold vital information even in the
1473.68s: face of interrogation or torture. Of
1476.04s: course, pause here. This seems a little
1478.72s: anthropomorphic uh to to to my liking. I
1482.24s: just feel like, hey, you know, if this
1484.32s: is an interpretation of something, it
1486.80s: does also feel like we are imposing out
1488.88s: what something we would do onto this
1491.28s: other species. But who knows, perhaps
1492.96s: they are more like us than we think. But
1495.20s: in spite of that, I've always felt that
1496.64s: the alien being was not really trying to
1498.96s: hide anything from me. I just never got
1501.68s: that feeling. Her communication always
1503.20s: seemed honest and sincere to me, but I
1505.12s: suppose you can never know for sure. I
1507.52s: definitely feel that I shared a unique
1509.20s: bond with the alien. It was a kind of
1510.96s: trust or empathy that you have with a
1513.20s: patient or child. I think this is
1515.52s: because the alien could understand that
1517.12s: I was really interested in her and had
1519.28s: no harmful intention, nor would I allow
1521.60s: any harm to come to her if I could
1523.28s: prevent it. This was true, too. I refer
1527.68s: to the alien as her. Actually, the being
1529.68s: was not sexual in any way, either
1532.32s: physiologically or psychologically. She
1535.76s: did have a rather strong feminine
1537.60s: presence and demeanor. However, in terms
1539.84s: of physiology, the being was asexual and
1542.96s: had no internal or external reproductive
1545.28s: organs. Her body was more like the body
1547.36s: of a doll or a
1551.00s: robot. There were no internal organs as
1553.76s: the body was not constructed of
1555.60s: biological cells. It did have kind of a
1559.04s: circuit system or electrical nervous
1561.68s: system that ran through the body, but I
1563.68s: could not understand how it worked. Oh,
1566.00s: that's interesting.
1570.12s: Huh. That's this part I I uh this part
1573.68s: for me does raise a bit of a orange flag
1577.04s: I would say just
1578.76s: because you know we've read so many
1581.04s: other documents and and and so many
1583.24s: other eyewitnesses who have seen the
1585.68s: bodies do say that they were not you
1589.36s: know engineered mechanical or otherwise
1592.60s: electrical circuits that they were flesh
1595.68s: and
1596.44s: bone in stature and appearance. body was
1598.96s: quite short and petite around 40 in
1600.80s: tall. The head was disproportionately
1603.36s: large relative to the arms, legs, and
1605.04s: torso which were thin. There were three
1606.64s: fingers on each of the two hands and
1608.64s: feet which were somewhat prehensile.
1611.12s: Okay, hold on. So, we're talking about
1613.36s: tridactyls here. Now this does not
1615.52s: comport with the aliens uh that were
1619.68s: dissected by the ebo microbiologist at
1623.36s: whether it's Battel or Fort
1626.52s: Detric Dietrich. But this does bear some
1630.64s: similarity to I think some of the
1633.12s: original drawings of the beings at
1635.32s: Roswell and also the tridactyls that
1638.64s: were discovered in Peru. However, those
1641.12s: tridactyls were definitely
1643.88s: not made of electrical
1647.24s: circuits. I understand that a space
1649.60s: officer does not need these as space has
1652.24s: no atmosphere to conduct sound.
1653.92s: Therefore, sound related sensory organs
1655.92s: are not built into the body, nor does
1657.44s: the body need to consume food, hence the
1659.28s: absence of a mouth. Okay. The eyes were
1661.92s: quite large. I was never able to
1663.68s: determine the exact degree of visual
1665.28s: acuity of which the eyes were capable,
1667.68s: but I observed that her sense of sight
1670.08s: must have been extremely acute. I think
1672.64s: the lenses of the eyes, which were very
1674.96s: dark and opaque, may also have been able
1677.76s: to detect waves of particles beyond the
1679.60s: visual spectrum of light. I suspect that
1681.84s: this may have included the full range of
1683.76s: electromagnetic spectrum or more, but I
1686.32s: do not know this for sure. Uh as a
1688.96s: little side note, there are footnotes
1691.60s: present in this document and again these
1693.84s: footnotes are to I think rather
1696.72s: important. Uh but these footnotes are
1699.04s: written by Lawrence R. Spencer in his
1702.08s: book. So if you want to read those
1703.52s: footnotes again, pick up the book. You
1705.84s: can get those footnotes. When the being
1707.68s: looked at me, her gaze seemed to
1709.28s: penetrate right through me as though she
1711.76s: had x-ray vision. I found this a little
1714.88s: embarrassing at first until I realized
1716.96s: that she had no sexual
1719.48s: intentions. In fact, I don't think she'd
1722.40s: ever had the thought that I was male or
1724.48s: female. It's a strange comment. It
1726.88s: become very obvious after a short time
1729.12s: with the being that her body did not
1730.72s: require oxygen, food, or water, or any
1732.96s: of the external source of nutrition of
1735.12s: energy or energy. As I later learned,
1738.56s: this being supplied her own energy,
1740.40s: which animated and operated the body. It
1743.28s: seemed a little bit eerie at first, but
1744.96s: I got used to the idea. It's a ve a
1747.04s: really a very very simple body. There's
1749.36s: not much to it compared to her own
1750.88s: bodies. Arrol explained to me that it
1753.20s: was not mechanical like a robot, nor was
1755.52s: it biological. It is animated directly
1758.48s: by her as a spiritual being.
1762.00s: Technically, from a medical standpoint,
1764.00s: I would say that Arrol's body could not
1766.64s: even be called alive. Her doll body is
1770.72s: not a biological life form with cells
1773.44s: and so
1774.76s: forth. It had smooth skin and covering
1778.16s: which was in gray which was gray in
1780.64s: color. The body was highly tolerant to
1783.12s: changes in temperatures, atmospheric
1784.88s: conditions and pressure. The limbs were
1787.20s: quite frail without musculature. In
1790.16s: space there is no gravity so very little
1792.08s: muscle strength is needed. The body was
1794.28s: used was used almost entirely on
1796.88s: spacecraft or in low or no gravity
1799.20s: environments. Since Earth had heavy
1801.36s: gravity, the body was not able to walk
1803.04s: around very well as the legs were not
1805.04s: really suited to that purpose. The feet
1806.72s: and hands were quite flexible and agile.
1809.96s: However, this is very
1812.28s: bizarre. Overnight before my first
1815.12s: interview with the alien, the area had
1816.96s: been transformed into a buzzing hive of
1819.04s: activity. There were a dozen men working
1820.80s: on the setup of lights and camera
1822.16s: equipment. A motion picture camera and
1824.24s: microphone and a tape recorder was there
1826.56s: also set up in the interview room. I
1829.20s: don't understand why a microphone was
1830.64s: needed since there was no verbal
1831.92s: communication possible with the alien.
1834.00s: There was also a stenographer and
1836.24s: several people busily typing on
1838.48s: typewriters. I was informed that the
1840.72s: expert foreign language interpreter and
1843.60s: a codereing team had been flown to the
1846.40s: base during the night to assist with my
1848.64s: efforts to communicate with the alien.
1850.88s: There were also several medical
1852.48s: personnel specialists in various fields
1854.88s: to examine the alien and a professor of
1857.28s: psychology was there to help formulate
1858.96s: questions and interpret the answers. As
1861.20s: I was just a nurse, I was not considered
1864.00s: to be a qualified interpreter. Even
1866.48s: though I was the only one who could
1867.92s: understand anything the alien was
1870.60s: thinking. There were many subsequent
1872.64s: conversations between us. Each interview
1874.80s: resulted in exponential increase in
1877.52s: understanding between us and I will
1880.08s: discuss later on in my notes. This is
1883.20s: the first transcript with the answers to
1885.20s: a list of questions provided to me by
1887.12s: the intelligence officer at the base
1888.72s: which I debriefed to the stenographer
1890.48s: immediately following the interview.
1892.40s: Folks, here we go. We're half an hour
1894.16s: into this video and we finally get to
1895.76s: the transcript. I apologize, but I think
1897.52s: the preamble was
1899.72s: required. Official transcript of the US
1902.00s: Army Air Force Roswell Air Force 509
1904.40s: bomb group. Subject: Alien interview.
1906.48s: Question: Are you injured? Answer:
1910.52s: No. Question: What medical assistance do
1913.68s: you require? Answer: None.
1917.48s: Question: Do you need food or water or
1919.76s: other sustenance? Answer, no.
1924.12s: Question: Do you have special
1925.92s: environmental needs such as air
1927.60s: temperature, atmospheric chemical
1929.20s: content, air pressure, or waste
1930.72s: elimination? Answer: No, I am not a
1933.36s: biological being. Question: Does your
1935.92s: body or spacecraft carry any germs or
1938.68s: contamination that may be harmful to
1940.88s: humans or earth life forms or other
1944.32s: Earth life forms? Answer, no germs in
1946.88s: space. Question: Does your government
1949.12s: know you are here? Answer, not at this
1951.84s: time. Question, are others of your kind
1954.48s: going to come looking for you? Answer,
1957.48s: yes. Question, what is the weapons
1960.48s: capability of your
1962.04s: people? Answer, very destructive. She
1965.76s: goes here to detail, I did not
1967.60s: understand the exact nature of the kind
1969.20s: of arms or weapons that they might have,
1971.36s: but I did not feel that there was any
1973.76s: malevolent intention in her reply, just
1975.84s: a statement of fact. Now, I will say
1978.24s: that this definitely does sound like a
1981.36s: military interrogation. As you all know,
1984.24s: if the military discovered a drop of
1985.92s: water, the first thing they would do is
1987.28s: figure out how to drown you in it. They
1989.12s: would worry about the millions of people
1990.72s: dying of dehydration after they figured
1992.80s: out how to drown someone in a drop of
1994.48s: water. I guarantee you that's how they
1996.08s: function. So, you know, this adds a
1997.84s: little bit of credibility to the case as
2001.36s: soon as they're like, "Hey, you know,
2002.88s: what's up? How you doing?" And then how
2005.84s: bad are your weapons? Where are they?
2007.76s: Can we see them? Can we play with them?
2009.12s: Can we use them? Question, why did your
2011.76s: spacecraft crash? Answer, it was struck
2014.32s: by an electrical discharge from the
2016.08s: atmosphere which caused us to lose
2017.96s: control. Now, this is also pretty much
2020.64s: echoed in the day after Roswell by
2023.44s: Philip J. Corso that there was some
2026.48s: atmospheric there was a massive storm
2028.96s: that night. So perhaps something in the
2031.92s: atmosphere, perhaps electrical charge,
2034.64s: you know, who knows? Question: Why was
2037.28s: your spacecraft in this area? Answer:
2039.60s: Investigation of burning clouds,
2042.08s: radiation,
2043.96s: explosion. Well, I mean, I think we know
2046.72s: what they're referring to. Possibly the
2049.52s: nuclear tests that were going on in New
2052.28s: Mexico. Question: How does your
2054.48s: spacecraft fly? Answer: It is controlled
2057.44s: through mind. responds to thought
2060.16s: commands. Mind or thought command are
2062.40s: the only English language words I can
2064.08s: think of to describe the thought. Their
2065.76s: bodies, and I think the spacecraft, are
2068.08s: connected directly to them through some
2069.76s: kind of electrical nervous system that
2071.52s: they control with their own
2073.56s: thoughts. So, they're almost a part of
2075.92s: the vehicle, it would seem. And again we
2078.24s: find ourselves describing what seems to
2080.24s: be this ephemeral form of life. A
2083.44s: disposable life form that
2086.36s: sole responsibility is sort of task
2090.96s: oriented and based around the flight of
2093.28s: this craft or whatever the task uh it
2095.92s: had. But it does not seem like there is
2098.32s: much value in these in this individual
2101.76s: uh life form. And we see this over and
2103.92s: over. We hear this through, you know,
2106.24s: even the crash retrieval whistleblower
2108.40s: that came out on 4chan that we read
2110.08s: through. Everything was built to spec.
2112.32s: There was no extra nothing. Almost as if
2115.60s: the mobile construction unit that was
2118.08s: placed in the ocean was some type of
2122.08s: immune system placed on different
2124.40s: planets in order to protect, preserve,
2127.68s: and encourage life, you know, forming on
2130.00s: planets. Um, and included in these
2133.44s: things are are sometimes biological
2135.60s: entities because they had to interact
2137.04s: with the local population. Who knows?
2139.36s: But it does seem like this is a trend
2141.76s: throughout the type of beings that are
2143.88s: encountered or at least you know the
2147.20s: smaller type of beings. And the Ebo
2149.84s: scientists as well said that they had
2151.44s: certain nodes on their brain and that
2154.80s: the study of this was paramount to
2156.48s: everything else. uh the military wanted
2158.80s: to know how the interface of you know
2162.08s: the physical nodes on the brain
2163.60s: interacted with the craft itself and if
2165.68s: you look at even Bob Lazar and the craft
2169.20s: that he worked on there didn't seem to
2171.52s: be any type of hardware that you could
2174.32s: interact with unless it was on the top
2176.96s: floor which he didn't go to but there's
2179.36s: just these three little chairs that they
2181.52s: sat in and then perhaps somehow locked
2185.20s: in through you know their own physiology
2188.16s: um you know to the steering mechanism or
2190.88s: or flight capabilities of the craft.
2193.60s: Question, do you have written language
2195.04s: or symbols for communication? Answer,
2196.96s: yes. Question, what planet are you from?
2199.76s: Answer: The home, birthplace, world of
2203.12s: the
2204.52s: domain. Since I am not an astronomer, I
2207.28s: have no way of thinking in terms of
2208.64s: stars, galaxies, constellations, and
2210.88s: directions in space. The impression I
2212.64s: received was of a planet in the center
2214.96s: of a huge cluster of galaxies. Uh that
2218.24s: is to her like home or birthplace. The
2221.36s: word domain is the closest word I can
2223.76s: think of to describe her concept,
2225.44s: images, and thoughts about where she is
2227.32s: from. It could as easily be called the
2230.32s: territory or the realm. However, I'm
2232.72s: sure that it was not just a planet or
2234.80s: solar system or a cluster of stars, but
2236.96s: an enormous number of galaxies.
2241.28s: Question: Will your government send
2243.28s: representatives to meet with our
2245.04s: leaders? Answer: No. Question, what are
2249.20s: your intentions concerning Earth?
2250.64s: Answer:
2251.88s: preserve/protect property of the domain.
2255.08s: Property? Oh, we're just property, huh?
2258.64s: Question, what have you learned about
2260.40s: Earth, governments, and military
2261.76s: installations? Answer: poor slash small.
2265.76s: Period. Destroy planet. Question: Why
2269.12s: haven't your people made your existence
2270.72s: known to the people of Earth? Answer:
2272.64s: Watch /observe. No
2275.32s: contact. I got the impression that
2277.36s: contact with people on Earth was not
2278.88s: permitted, but I could not think of a
2280.56s: word or idea that communicated the
2282.40s: impression I got exactly. They are just
2284.80s: observing
2286.12s: us or
2288.04s: monitoring. Question: Have your people
2290.40s: visited Earth's previously? Answer:
2294.28s: periodic/re repeating observations.
2298.00s: Question: How long have you known about
2299.92s: Earth? Answer: Long before humans. I am
2304.08s: not sure if the word prehistoric would
2305.92s: be more accurate, but it was definitely
2308.24s: a very long period of time before human
2310.48s: beings evolved. Question: What do you
2313.92s: know about the history of civilization
2316.24s: on Earth? Answer: small
2319.48s: interest/attention. Small time. The
2321.92s: answer to this question seemed very
2323.28s: vague to me. However, I perceived that
2324.96s: her interest in Earth history is not
2327.12s: very strong or that she did not pay much
2329.20s: attention to it or maybe I don't know. I
2332.40s: didn't really get an answer to the
2333.88s: question. Question: Can you describe
2336.56s: your home world to us? Answer: Place of
2339.36s: civilization, culture,
2341.48s: history. Large planet, wealth,
2344.16s: resources, always order, power,
2348.52s: knowledge/wisdom, two stars, three
2351.12s: moons, two stars. Zeta reticuli perhaps
2354.88s: binary star
2359.16s: system. Question what is the state of
2361.84s: development of your civilization? Answer
2364.28s: ancient trillions of
2367.40s: years always above all others. Plan
2372.20s: schedule prog progress win high goals
2376.32s: slash ideas.
2379.36s: I use the number trillions because I am
2382.16s: sure that the meaning was a number
2383.60s: larger than many billions. The idea of
2386.48s: the length of time she communicated is
2388.80s: beyond me. It's really closer to the
2391.84s: idea of infinity in terms of Earth
2395.08s: years. Question, do you believe in God?
2398.36s: Answer, we think it is. Make it
2404.04s: continue always.
2407.20s: I'm sure that the alien being does not
2408.88s: understand the concept of God or worship
2410.88s: as we do. I assume that the people in
2413.12s: her civilization were all atheists. My
2416.16s: impression was that they think very
2418.48s: highly of themselves and are very
2420.56s: prideful indeed. Question: What type of
2423.76s: society do you have? Answer: Order,
2426.72s: power, future, always control, grow.
2431.20s: These are the closest words I could use
2432.88s: to describe the idea she had about her
2435.04s: own society or civilization. Her emotion
2438.48s: when communicating her response to this
2440.32s: question became very intense, very
2442.72s: bright and
2444.60s: emphatic. Her thought was filled with an
2446.96s: emotion that gave me a feeling of
2449.28s: jubilation or joy. But it made me very
2452.72s: nervous
2455.24s: also. Question: Are there other
2457.68s: intelligent life forms beside yourself
2459.52s: in the universe? answer everywhere. We
2462.72s: are great slash highest of all. So,
2466.16s: she's saying that there are, but she's
2469.04s: at the top. Due to her small stature,
2472.00s: I'm sure that she did not mean tallest
2473.60s: or biggest. Again, her prideful nature
2476.56s: showed through in the feeling I received
2478.72s: from
2480.44s: her. That's the first interview. Here it
2482.72s: says here uh this was the conclusion of
2484.64s: the first interview. When the answers to
2486.72s: the first list of questions were typed
2488.48s: and given to the people who were waiting
2489.92s: for them, they were very excited and I
2491.84s: was able to get uh that I was able to
2493.60s: get the alien to say anything. However,
2496.08s: after they finished reading my answers,
2497.60s: they were disappointed that I could not
2499.12s: understand more clearly. Now, they had a
2501.68s: lot of new questions because the answers
2503.36s: I received to the first list of
2505.48s: questions. An officer told me to await
2508.00s: further instructions. I waited for
2510.32s: several hours in the adjoining office. I
2512.96s: was not allowed to continue my interview
2514.72s: with the alien. However, I was always
2517.20s: treated and allowed to eat and sleep and
2519.60s: use the restroom facilities whenever I
2521.88s: wanted. Eventually, a new list of
2524.56s: questions was written for me to ask the
2526.08s: alien. I gathered that quite a few other
2528.80s: agents, governments, a government and
2531.60s: military officials had arrived at the
2533.20s: base by this time. They told me that
2534.88s: several other people would be in the
2536.16s: room with me during the next interview
2537.68s: so they could prompt me to ask for more
2539.76s: details during the interview. However,
2541.92s: when I attempted to conduct the
2543.44s: interview with these people in the room,
2544.88s: I received no thoughts, emotions, or any
2547.68s: other perceptible communication from the
2549.56s: aliens. Nothing. The alien just sat in a
2552.48s: chair without moving. We all left the
2555.76s: interview room. The intelligence agent
2557.44s: became very agitated about this. He
2559.52s: accused me of lying or making up answers
2561.68s: to the first questions. I insisted that
2564.08s: my answers were honest and as accurate
2566.08s: as I could make them. Later that day, it
2569.28s: was decided that several other people
2571.68s: would attempt to ask questions of the
2573.20s: alien. However, in spite of several
2575.36s: attempts by different experts, no one
2577.92s: else was able to get any communication
2580.48s: at all from the alien. So, over the next
2582.40s: several days, a psychic research
2584.88s: scientist from back east was flown to
2587.28s: the base to interview the alien. Her
2589.52s: name was Gertrude something or other. I
2591.92s: don't recall the last name. On another
2594.80s: occasion, an Indian clairvoyant named
2597.28s: Krishna Merti came to the base to try
2599.84s: and communicate with the alien. Neither
2601.52s: one was successful at getting the alien
2603.28s: to communicate anything. I was
2605.12s: personally not able to communicate
2606.88s: telepathically with either of these
2608.48s: people. Although I did think that Mr.
2610.72s: Krishna Merti was a very kind and
2612.96s: intelligent gentleman. Finally, it was
2615.28s: decided that I should be left with the
2617.20s: alien by myself to see if I could get
2621.20s: any
2622.12s: answers. Truly, truly
2625.24s: fascinating. Very simple answers. We've
2628.56s: established that this, you know, short
2630.64s: little
2631.48s: being is kind of giving everyone else
2634.08s: the silent treatment except for what
2637.04s: seems to be Matilda and when there are
2639.84s: less people in the
2641.16s: room. Um this creature also seems to to
2645.52s: think that they are the sort of pinnacle
2648.96s: of um of all beings in the universe or
2651.36s: in the known universe. All right, we we
2653.52s: move on. It says in the next interview I
2656.24s: was asked to I was I was told to ask the
2658.80s: alien only one question. So the question
2660.96s: is why have you stopped communicating?
2663.60s: And the answer no stop others
2668.28s: hidden/cover secret fear. Matilda says
2671.28s: the alien cannot communicate with them
2673.84s: because they were afraid of her or do
2676.08s: not trust her. And it is clear to me
2678.40s: that the alien is very aware that some
2680.40s: people have secret intentions toward her
2683.04s: and are hiding their real thoughts. It
2685.36s: is equally obvious to me that the alien
2687.36s: does not have any even a tiny bit of
2689.52s: fear of us or anything else for that
2691.80s: matter. Whoa. No fear. I guess if you
2696.64s: don't have
2699.64s: fear, you probably live in the present
2703.76s: entirely or have an absolute disregard
2707.28s: for the idea of
2709.48s: death. Like death is nothing to fear.
2712.64s: Literally nothing to fear. And perhaps
2714.88s: if you're trillions of years old, you've
2718.08s: long since conquered any fear. Perhaps
2721.44s: even conquered the idea of pain or time.
2725.20s: And I often talk about time as being
2727.68s: linked to fear because I do believe that
2730.16s: fear is entirely timebased. I I think
2732.32s: that if you think about anything that
2735.52s: causes you anxiety, angst, pain,
2740.44s: trauma, any type of negative, fearful
2744.76s: emotion is
2746.92s: linked inextricably to time. It's the
2750.00s: anticipation of pain, the anticipation
2752.48s: of losing someone or something you did
2754.80s: in the past. Like even if you're being
2756.68s: attacked by a
2758.92s: gorilla, you're still thinking, "Oh no,
2762.24s: I'm going to die. This is going to hurt.
2764.64s: I don't want to die." You're you're
2766.00s: projecting forwards, right? So fear is
2768.72s: really linked to time. And so if their
2771.76s: concept of time is different, perhaps
2774.16s: fear just completely vanishes. And also
2777.76s: if their concept of life is different
2780.40s: then obviously death becomes a different
2782.96s: concept as well. So the subtle idea that
2786.72s: this being does not really fear anything
2788.96s: actually gives us quite a bit of
2790.32s: information on you know how advanced
2793.04s: they might be. So her personal note she
2795.60s: says I pondered the words I chose to
2797.28s: convey the meaning of the aliens
2798.88s: thoughts very carefully before reporting
2801.28s: to the stenographer and to the people
2802.56s: who were waiting anxiously in the other
2804.08s: room. Personally, I never suffered any
2806.40s: fear or misapprehension about the alien
2808.40s: whatsoever. I was very, very curious and
2810.88s: excited to learn anything and everything
2812.64s: I could about her and from her. However,
2815.20s: like the alien, I did not have much
2817.36s: trust or confidence in the agents or
2819.72s: authorities who are controlling my
2821.92s: interviews. I had no idea what their
2824.08s: intentions towards her might be.
2825.84s: However, I'm sure that the military
2827.76s: officers were very, very nervous about
2830.08s: having an alien spacecraft and pilot on
2832.64s: their hands. At that moment, my greatest
2834.64s: worry was how to more clearly understand
2837.20s: the thoughts and ideas of the alien. I
2839.44s: think I was doing a I was doing pretty
2841.28s: well as a telepathic receiver, but not
2843.76s: as good as a telepathic sender. I wanted
2847.84s: desperately to figure out a better way
2849.60s: to communicate with the alien in a way
2851.84s: that would enable the growing legion of
2854.24s: government officials to understand her
2855.92s: more directly without having to rely on
2858.08s: my interpretation of her thoughts. I did
2860.64s: not feel very well qualified to act as
2862.96s: an interpreter. Yet, I was the only
2864.72s: person with whom the alien would
2866.24s: communicate. So, it was up to me to get
2868.48s: the job done. Like, receiving is one
2871.36s: thing, but sending is a whole other
2873.68s: thing. I was also becoming acutely aware
2876.64s: that this was probably the biggest news
2879.12s: event in the history of Earth and that I
2881.76s: should be proud to have any part in it.
2883.76s: Of course, by that time, the entire
2885.68s: incident had been officially denied in
2887.68s: the press, and the cover up of immense
2889.28s: proportions by the military, and the
2891.28s: powers that be had already begun.
2894.08s: However, I was beginning to feel the
2895.76s: pressure of the responsibility for being
2897.36s: the first person on Earth, as far as I
2899.20s: knew, to communicate with an
2900.40s: extraterrestrial life form. I think I
2902.32s: know how Columbus must have felt when he
2904.56s: discovered a new world the size of a
2906.88s: continent on one small planet.
2909.84s: But I was about to discover an entirely
2911.84s: new, unexplored
2914.44s: universe. While I waited for my next
2916.80s: instructions from my superiors, I went
2918.96s: to my quarters under escort of several
2921.44s: heavily armed MPs. Several other men
2923.92s: dressed in black suits and ties
2925.68s: accompanied me also. They were still
2927.76s: there when I got up in the morning.
2929.84s: After breakfast, which was brought to me
2932.56s: in my own quarters, they escorted me
2934.40s: back to the office at the base that was
2937.12s: used for the interview. So that was the
2939.60s: second interview. Um the immense
2943.08s: responsibility must weigh heavy on
2945.44s: Matilda at this point. I could not I
2948.48s: mean I have tried to imagine what that
2950.48s: might be like what that interaction
2951.92s: might be like coming face to
2954.44s: face with something so Eldridge so far
2960.44s: removed
2962.92s: from any known reality and and not just
2966.48s: seeing something that is
2968.44s: unrecognizable or feeling something that
2970.88s: is completely foreign and exotic such as
2974.08s: a telepathic communication. Not only
2976.68s: that, but
2979.16s: the stark
2982.28s: realization that you are the
2984.76s: one must be equally as
2988.92s: overwhelming as any of
2991.16s: that. Realizing that aliens are real,
2995.84s: there's a crash, this thing is
2998.68s: communicating, there are, you know,
3000.80s: other beings in the universe. We're not
3002.72s: alone. All of that is a massive shock to
3005.04s: the system. Has to be one of the biggest
3007.12s: shocks you've you'll ever receive. But
3010.68s: then there's the realization that that
3014.48s: you're the
3015.72s: one like you're Neo.
3019.32s: You you are
3023.64s: responsible for the entire
3027.64s: history of humankind.
3031.60s: Not your
3032.92s: generation, not your
3035.80s: government, not everyone that's alive,
3038.72s: everyone that's ever existed ever and
3042.08s: will ever exist. You are the
3045.64s: person
3048.76s: that that would be enough to
3051.12s: most people, I think. you know, you'd
3053.84s: have to be philosophically
3056.20s: oblivious to a certain extent to move
3058.56s: forward with this project because I
3060.00s: think that would just yeah, that would
3061.12s: be crippling. All right, we're going to
3062.40s: do one more interview here before we
3065.28s: take a break. This is the third
3067.76s: interview with Matilda. The third
3069.44s: interview and all subsequent interviews
3071.28s: that I had with the alien were observed
3073.04s: and recorded, as I mentioned above, by
3074.96s: dozens of other people. Although there
3076.80s: were no uh they were not physically
3078.64s: present, a special room had been
3080.24s: constructed with a window of one-way
3082.32s: glass through which the interview could
3084.24s: be observed from an adjoining room
3086.16s: without intruding on the alien. Now,
3089.36s: this has been talked about multiple
3091.44s: times. This has been talked about by um
3094.24s: Oscar Wolf. I think it's been mentioned
3096.64s: by
3097.72s: Danish. This oneway mirror with this
3100.40s: alien on the other side of it. Plus,
3102.00s: we've seen, you know, some sketchy alien
3104.64s: footage out there that may or may not be
3106.56s: real that also feels like this type of
3108.56s: environment. I just kind of feel bad for
3110.24s: these beings. Although they have no
3111.84s: fears, so there's no real reason to feel
3113.36s: bad, but I feel like what if we just set
3115.68s: up like a log cabin with a nice little
3117.36s: fire and some classical music? Wouldn't
3119.68s: that be more conducive to like an open
3122.36s: conversation rather than some stale, you
3125.76s: know? I don't know. Maybe that's why I'm
3128.24s: not a in the army. The alien had been
3130.56s: moved into a newly constructed room and
3132.88s: was seated in an ordinary oversted
3134.88s: living room chair covered with a flowery
3137.12s: fabric. All right, I take back what I
3138.80s: said. They they did take a cue from from
3141.84s: uh from my thoughts. I'm sure that
3144.72s: someone had been sent into town to buy a
3146.56s: chair from the nearest available
3147.76s: furniture store. The alien's body was
3149.68s: about the same size as a very thin
3152.00s: 5-year-old child, so she was dwarfed by
3155.04s: the chair. That's such a funny image.
3157.36s: And also a really interesting detail. I
3159.92s: mean, even as a if you're a fictional
3162.16s: writer, we need a chair. There are no
3164.24s: chairs. We got to get one. This is all
3165.76s: we got. Then having this tiny alien body
3168.08s: sitting in your grandma's chair. Since
3170.32s: her body was not biological, it didn't
3172.16s: need any food, air, or heat. And
3174.72s: apparently, she didn't sleep either.
3177.12s: There were no eyelids or eyebrows above
3178.96s: her eyes. So, the eyes didn't close. I
3181.20s: don't think anyone could tell whether
3182.96s: she was sleeping or awake as long as she
3185.12s: was sitting upright in the chair. Unless
3187.04s: she moved her body or gestured with her
3189.52s: hand, it would be hard to tell whether
3192.00s: she was even alive or not, unless you
3194.40s: could perceive her
3196.60s: thoughts. Eventually, I learned that the
3198.96s: alien was not identified by her body,
3201.44s: but by her personality, so to speak. She
3205.36s: was known by her fellow aliens as
3207.88s: a closest word I can use to describe the
3210.80s: name using the English alphabet. I sense
3213.36s: that she preferred the feminine gender.
3215.52s: I think we shared a natural female
3217.60s: empathy and nurturing attitude towards
3219.84s: life and each other. I'm sure she did
3222.72s: not feel comfortable with the combative,
3224.40s: aggressive, doineering attitude of the
3226.48s: male officers and agents, each of whom
3229.20s: was more concerned with their own
3230.64s: personal self-importance and power than
3233.28s: with discovering the secrets of the
3235.24s: universe. I do like this part. I'll be
3238.96s: I'll be fair and I'll be honest. if
3240.80s: there was an entity communicating with
3243.92s: us. And first of all, the entities that
3245.84s: we hear about are often this feminine
3248.28s: energy. But if they were to communicate
3250.56s: with us, yeah, you would I would rather
3252.56s: talk to a woman as well, especially if
3254.96s: you can read minds. I think we do need a
3257.48s: woman for uh for first contact. I think
3260.32s: that would be probably uh that would
3263.28s: probably help out our side of the, you
3268.08s: know, negotiations or discussions to
3270.88s: have somebody a little more empathetic
3273.32s: um be the communicator. When I entered
3276.64s: the room, she was very pleased to see
3278.00s: me. I felt a very genuine sense of
3280.00s: recognition, relief, and a warm feeling
3282.80s: from her. It was like the eager
3285.12s: excitement and unconditional platonic
3287.12s: affection one feels from a dog or child.
3289.52s: yet with a calm, reserved control. I
3292.40s: must say that I was surprised that I
3294.48s: felt the same sort of affection for the
3296.24s: alien being, especially since we had
3299.44s: spent so little time with each other. I
3302.48s: was pleased that I was able to continue
3304.00s: my interviews with her in spite of all
3306.00s: the attention it was getting from the
3307.52s: stream of government and military people
3309.20s: arriving at the base. It was very
3311.44s: obvious that the people who wrote the
3313.12s: next series of questions for me wanted
3315.76s: to learn how to communicate with the
3317.04s: alien themselves without having to go
3319.28s: through me. Here are the answers to the
3321.76s: new list of
3323.40s: questions. Question: Can you read or
3325.92s: write any Earth languages? Answer, no.
3329.04s: Question, do you understand numbers or
3331.04s: mathematics? Answer, yes, I am officer,
3333.52s: pilot, engineer.
3336.32s: Question: Can you write down or draw
3338.32s: symbols or pictures that we may be able
3340.24s: to translate into our own language?
3342.32s: Answer:
3343.72s: Uncertain. Question: Are there any other
3346.88s: signs or means of communication you can
3348.72s: use to help us understand your thoughts
3350.40s: more clearly? Answer: No. Matilda
3353.60s: writes, "I was very sure that this was
3355.68s: not true, but I understood clearly that
3357.84s: Arrol was not willing to communicate in
3359.76s: writing or drawing or sign language. My
3362.64s: feeling was that she was following
3364.08s: orders like any soldier who had been
3366.40s: captured, not to reveal any information
3368.24s: that might be useful to an enemy, even
3370.16s: under torture. She was only able and
3372.88s: willing to reveal non-confidential or
3375.20s: personal information or name, rank, and
3377.60s: serial number. Now, okay, this does make
3381.24s: sense on a logical
3383.80s: level. you know, if she was held captive
3386.56s: that she would withhold certain
3389.04s: sensitive informations as we would as
3392.28s: well. But it
3394.20s: also, you know, feels
3397.96s: very convenient in uh in in this story
3401.68s: that she's like, I can't give you
3402.96s: details, you know. So, you know, keep
3406.00s: that in mind. Question, can you show us
3409.04s: on a map of the stars which is the star
3411.36s: of your home planet? Answer, no. This is
3413.92s: not because she does not know the
3415.12s: directions from Earth to her home
3416.40s: planet. She was unwilling to reveal the
3418.28s: location. It was also due to the fact
3420.40s: that the star system of her home planet
3422.16s: does not exist on any star map on Earth.
3424.32s: It is too far
3425.80s: away. Question: How long will it take
3428.48s: your people to locate you here? Answer:
3431.16s: Unknown. Question: How long would it
3433.20s: take your people to travel here to
3434.72s: rescue you? Answer: Minutes or hours?
3439.44s: Question: How can we make them
3441.12s: understand that we do not intend to harm
3443.36s: you? Answer: Intentions are clear. See
3446.72s: in your mind, images,
3452.12s: feelings. Question. If you are not a
3454.72s: biological entity, why do you refer to
3456.72s: yourself as feminine? Answer: I am a
3459.48s: creator, mother.
3462.44s: Source. Matilda's personal notes. These
3465.36s: questions took me only a few minutes to
3466.96s: complete. I realized then that we may be
3469.76s: in for some serious trouble if the alien
3471.84s: was not willing to cooperate or reveal
3474.24s: any information that the military or
3476.16s: intelligence agencies or scientists
3478.00s: considered to be useful to them. I was
3480.56s: also sure the alien was very certain of
3482.88s: actual intentions of people who wrote
3484.88s: these questions as she could read their
3486.80s: minds just as easily as she could read
3488.96s: my thoughts and communicate with me
3491.24s: telepathically. Because of these
3492.96s: intentions, she was unwilling and unable
3495.52s: to cooperate with any of them in any way
3498.40s: under any
3499.64s: circumstances. I'm equally sure that
3502.16s: since she was not a biological life
3504.20s: form, that there was no kind of torture
3506.72s: or or coercion that would change her
3510.84s: mind. the power that this little being
3513.92s: has, you know, and
3517.00s: also, you know, if you're dealing with
3519.04s: something that's trillions of years more
3521.64s: advanced, there's nothing you're going
3523.52s: to get from this
3525.24s: being. You know, it's already been
3528.04s: created to withstand any of our
3531.36s: primitive techniques. Anyways, I think
3534.08s: it is interesting though. It's it it's
3536.16s: you know it's as if uh a bunch of ants
3538.80s: held a human captive you know and we're
3541.32s: like where's your queen and we're like
3544.48s: well we don't really obey the queen
3546.44s: anymore you know it just wouldn't make
3548.56s: sense to them you know one thing is
3550.48s: certain that when it comes to this
3552.16s: telepathic
3554.28s: communication and if
3556.68s: you take it even further into you know
3560.24s: perhaps you know fringe theories of
3563.68s: quantum mechanics that intention is
3565.92s: really
3566.84s: important. The intention you put behind
3569.72s: something, whether it's a thought,
3571.68s: whether it's an action, whatever it is,
3573.92s: whether it's just the start of your day
3575.92s: or writing a letter or saying thank you,
3578.88s: those intentions mean more than the
3581.36s: actions. They mean more than the words.
3583.44s: You know, if I'm helping someone
3585.88s: out, but in my mind I'm thinking of, oh,
3590.32s: I'm only doing this so that they, I
3594.16s: don't know, trust me, and then I'll
3595.60s: steal all their money, right? The
3597.68s: intention is all that matters. And in
3600.88s: the universe, I think
3603.72s: that might
3605.72s: be one of the closest universal laws
3608.64s: that we could probably fathom is that
3611.32s: intention overrides absolutely
3614.44s: everything. And if that's the case, then
3617.44s: intention must be fundamental to
3620.40s: communicate. It must be a
3623.08s: fundamental property of the universe to
3627.40s: change or collapse certain wave
3630.20s: functions. I think intention is very
3633.68s: important and we hear about this through
3636.24s: meditating. We hear about it through
3638.72s: manifesting. We hear about
3641.08s: it when you even study animals and you
3644.48s: can feel their intention whether it's
3647.12s: friendly or whether it's, you know,
3649.20s: unfriendly. I love this idea of
3651.60s: telepathic
3652.76s: communication being based on
3656.52s: impressions and intention and feelings
3659.12s: because I think that that probably
3661.20s: resonates and I mean that it literally
3663.52s: physically resonates more than writing
3667.68s: something down or saying something. I
3669.76s: find it really interesting that we get
3671.28s: to witness
3673.56s: Matilda's climatization to her
3677.60s: communication ability with this
3680.20s: entity. Like she is slowly discovering
3684.96s: how to decipher intention into words
3688.24s: that these primitive military officers
3690.24s: can understand. But at the same time,
3692.80s: she acts as like any translator would in
3696.48s: a hostile situation. She acts as a sort
3699.60s: of mediator. She has to be careful of
3702.08s: what she communicates because it could
3704.56s: affect the lives of other beings in the
3707.12s: room. You know, learning how to
3708.64s: communicate telepathically, but at the
3710.08s: same time having this responsibility. I
3712.16s: mean, must be so intense. Folks, I would
3715.28s: love to know what you think of this
3718.40s: document so far and this book. I think
3722.96s: you know if true it is
3726.04s: a invaluable piece of information for
3729.72s: humanity. If it is completely fabricated
3733.36s: then at the very least it is extremely
3735.76s: entertaining and allows your mind to
3739.64s: expand. And I think that's
3742.20s: the really the the the positive effect
3744.96s: of of fictional writing and
3747.80s: storytelling. you. Some people think,
3749.68s: "No, it's just going to muddy the waters
3751.36s: for UAP disclosure." It takes people who
3754.32s: are inspired by fiction to want to
3756.24s: pursue this stuff. Either way, this is
3759.20s: fascinating. Thank you guys so much for
3761.28s: joining me today. It felt really good to
3762.72s: go through this with you and to just
3763.92s: sort of riff, you know, um a lot of this
3766.48s: stuff off. Uh I would really really love
3770.16s: to know your thoughts on this, whether
3771.52s: you think it's true, whether you think
3773.20s: it's BS, or whether, you know, you have
3775.60s: your own thoughts that you would like to
3776.96s: add to this. uh maybe connections that
3779.28s: you've made to other documents that I've
3781.04s: missed. I would love to hear your
3782.64s: thoughts. And if you want to e go even
3785.84s: further, go to Discord. It's free. We
3788.16s: discuss stuff like this all the time.
3790.00s: It's an amazing community. Highly
3791.92s: encourage you guys to drop by and be a
3793.44s: part of the community. We're almost at
3794.80s: 5,000 members over there and we're just
3796.56s: chatting away. So, that's something you
3798.24s: guys can join. Um check out area52.shop.
