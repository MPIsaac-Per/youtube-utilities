1.54s: [Music]
3.38s: [Applause]
9.80s: [Music]
32.72s: Which alien
34.68s: species do you find most interesting?
41.84s: What a what a lovely question.
45.76s: It's a very good question.
 The mantises
48.88s: uh the ones I am with
 I tend to think
52.16s: more of like interdimensional.
 The
54.32s: Nordics are fascinating. The Nordics,
56.88s: tall blondes that look like humans,
 the
59.12s: ones that look like us.
61.84s: I attended a conference for UFO
63.76s: enthusiasts called Contact in the
65.52s: Desert. While there, I was able to ask a
68.08s: few of the best researchers in the field
70.32s: about my favorite
72.20s: topic. And if you want to see the full
74.40s: versions of these interviews, I'll be
76.16s: posting them for free on my Patreon
78.16s: account. Link in the description.
80.96s: So, you got the grace. Are they a
82.72s: species that evolved on a planet and
86.16s: this is the version of a sentient animal
88.40s: there? It's possible, but my guess is
90.96s: it's more complicated. So, first of all,
93.04s: there do seem to be a lot of reports of
94.56s: what we might call the grays, short
96.08s: little guys, big black eyes. They seem
98.16s: to uh be uh adhering to some mandate or
102.96s: operative when it comes to making these
105.44s: incisions, inserting microchips, the
107.92s: functionaries doing the experiments, the
110.24s: anal probes, all that stuff.
 You know,
112.40s: collecting genetic material. They often
114.80s: repeat do not fear or things like that.
117.44s: I don't believe that it's all just some
119.12s: cultural phenomenon. Uh we do know that
121.68s: like in the early years of abduction
123.88s: research, these early people
127.36s: uh were pulling these types of
129.12s: descriptions out long before it was
131.04s: really part of our cultural uh
133.36s: zeitgeist. They they there are several
135.52s: sizes which means they may have some
137.44s: significant differences. Yep. Right.
 Uh
140.48s: and they are the they're versions of the
142.88s: basic gray that we know.
 Yeah.
 The
144.96s: classic one is the one on Whitley
146.64s: Whitley Stver's Communion book.
 I don't
149.28s: think that they are as fixed in their
151.92s: bodies as we are. In other words, they
153.84s: can we, you know, with with training, a
156.80s: human being can sometimes learn how to
159.44s: leave their body. I've done that a few
162.00s: times and you have too, I'm sure. Uh,
166.00s: and it but the grays, I think, can enter
169.04s: and leave them at will easily. And I I
173.68s: think in that sense, we're we're similar
176.00s: in that we have souls that are connected
177.92s: to the physical. and that that may be
180.64s: part of why they're here, but they're
182.64s: the most interesting to me because
184.24s: they're interested in me.
 And then they
186.24s: seem sort of homminid in some ways. And
188.32s: so it brings up these onlogically
189.84s: interesting questions. Are they sort of
191.84s: Allah, your great Twitter post, some
194.00s: vonoyman replicator, you know, part of
196.16s: some uh uh kit deployed by an advanced a
200.32s: more advanced extraterrestrial
201.76s: civilization? Are they robotic droids or
204.64s: are they us from the future? But I
206.96s: suspect that those little grays are
209.36s: functionaries that are robots that are
212.80s: synthetic beings that are created to do
214.80s: work as opposed to the actual ET or if
218.00s: that's what they are. I have had a brief
220.64s: encounter with one of the Nordics who
222.48s: proceeded to tell me the graves are
224.00s: extremely dangerous and stay away from
225.68s: them. But the graves are mine, my main
228.24s: ones.
229.63s: [Applause]
231.74s: [Music]
233.56s: [Applause]
234.58s: [Music]
239.20s: But how about the Nordics? They look
241.52s: like humans only better looking. Where
243.84s: are they from? You have human beings
245.76s: like evolve on another planet that look
247.28s: exactly like us that can fit in.
 There
249.52s: is no way that on another planet in a
252.00s: full evolutionary cycle you get a
253.92s: Swedish model. No way. And so they have
257.44s: all huge amount of our DNA
 if you're
259.84s: just adhering to normal astronomy. AAM's
262.32s: razor would say that's not right because
264.72s: you have all these different you know
267.04s: atmospheric conditions and you know if
269.84s: you're in another planet the likelihood
271.20s: of evolutionary convergence I mean we
273.04s: know now there's siliconbased life so
275.20s: even just the idea we have of carbon
276.88s: based life let alone you know we have 8
279.04s: million species on earth 20 are you know
281.52s: I think uh uh uh upright and bipedal or
284.64s: something so what do they look like
287.12s: blonde muscular perfect body human
290.72s: looking entities that had kind of a
293.36s: different eye feature.
 They're generally
296.64s: a a specific age, 30, 35,
300.16s: uh, perfect features, but I've heard
302.56s: they've got these blue piercing eyes.
305.04s: You know, the theosophical society in
306.80s: the late 19th century, people like
308.32s: Madame Blovski and um, what is the first
311.92s: root race? They're, you know, seven root
313.92s: races or whatever, you know. I think I
316.08s: believe the the second is the Leam
317.92s: Murans. I believe the third is the
319.44s: Atlanteanss. The first fruit race is the
321.48s: Hyperoreans, these sort of tall white,
323.84s: you know, earth conscientious creatures
325.76s: or whatever.
 Is there is there a story
327.52s: in particular that comes to mind when
329.04s: thinking of these humanlook ones?
 Well,
332.00s: no. I think it would be probably in my
333.68s: case Betty
334.92s: Andreas. And the reason there's lots of
338.08s: reasons for it.
339.48s: First, Betty's story is so compelling.
344.48s: Betty had listen heard and repeated what
348.80s: she thought was star language. In other
351.44s: words, it was not an intelligible
353.20s: language to her. But when I read it and
356.16s: then listened to the transcript, it was
358.08s: very clear that it has something to do
360.64s: with Gaelic. But it wasn't Gaelic. It
363.60s: was something like Gaelic. And I found
366.08s: an expert in the UK as I recall. And he
370.24s: said it was a very old form of Gaelic.
373.76s: and that it meant children of the
377.36s: northern people, you wander in eternal
381.56s: darkness. And that
384.04s: is been a kind of byword of mine ever
388.68s: since. I don't know there are a few, you
391.60s: know, like there's the Ingo Swan at the
395.44s: supermarket, you know, saying this woman
397.36s: is ravishing and I believe she was kind
399.12s: of this tall blonde, you know, beautiful
400.96s: woman. There there's two of them that
403.68s: happened in the same year and that's
405.76s: Travis Walton that I believe 100%. And
408.96s: then there's the Billy Meyer story that
410.80s: I believe at 30%. the Nordics really
412.96s: first appeared with the Billy Meyer uh
415.12s: work and some and that's a very very
417.60s: very complicated case
 but and then of
420.72s: course you know something we experienced
422.16s: together that the you know our audiences
423.92s: will see at some point is Charles Hall
426.48s: uh who spoke to the tall whites spent a
428.88s: lot of time with them but also the
430.40s: Nordic people with the 24 teeth I'll
433.44s: tell you I have two I call them bookend
435.60s: stories they go perfectly together
 I was
437.68s: following Timothy good of Top Secret you
440.72s: know that was like my research
442.16s: encyclopedia uh for making out of the
444.48s: blue and and uh and then I don't
447.60s: remember if he talks about it in a book
448.96s: or if it was subsequent interview but he
451.36s: talks
452.68s: about him seeing one uh and then
456.56s: communicating telepathically and Tim
458.00s: Timothy good in my book was very
459.52s: credible guy like I you know he's a
462.00s: prolific writer and and and uh
464.40s: considered to be a a really good
466.16s: researcher so that kind of got my
468.56s: attention a little bit about 20 years
470.80s: ago 2008 or no 2009 I was at some place
474.48s: in uh in Vegas I'm talking to um an army
479.52s: colonel retired colonel who had a lot of
481.68s: experience with black projects he was a
483.44s: brilliant guy and he told me a story
486.08s: about he and his wife his wife was with
488.08s: him when he told the story and they had
491.04s: another friend a female friend and they
493.44s: were at a Las Vegas casino and he said
496.24s: uh this guy by the way knew a lot about
498.72s: the UFO subject but he said We're on our
501.12s: own time. We're hanging out at a casino.
502.88s: I think it was the win actually, which
504.56s: is a great casino hotel, but I can't
506.72s: recall. He said, "We're up there. We're
508.08s: on the second floor." And our friend,
509.92s: who was, he said, was a
512.12s: psychic, she stops two of them, and she
515.20s: says, "That woman over there is not
519.04s: human." And they look over and there's
520.56s: this very beautiful blonde woman in this
522.88s: striking blue outfit. Now, it's Las
524.88s: Vegas.
 Yeah,
 you get that there.
 Sure.
527.68s: Blue is interesting, too.
 Oh, yes. Yes.
530.24s: She and his wife get scared and they go
532.96s: down the escalator which is right there.
534.80s: The colonel is is hanging behind and
537.84s: he's he's looking at this woman and he
540.40s: said to me and that's when I heard her
542.16s: in my
543.80s: mind. She turned slightly and he said I
547.52s: heard her. She sounded like a cop on the
550.32s: beat like nothing to see here. Go about
553.68s: your
554.60s: business. You don't belong. Like and
556.96s: he's he's like how did I get that
558.40s: thought? And at that moment she's joined
561.12s: by this beautiful blonde man wearing
564.40s: blue again at you thinking cir to sole
567.44s: like I don't know what this could be but
569.36s: so they're hanging out they're
571.12s: conferring he doesn't hear anything at
572.64s: this point so then they start walking
575.12s: toward the escalator where he is so this
578.24s: guy is a colonel he has a PhD he's a
581.04s: sharp guy and he's thinking I am going
584.96s: to talk to these people I don't know
586.88s: what I'm going to say but I I'm going to
588.08s: talk to them I find out what the hell is
589.92s: going on here. So they walk toward him
592.24s: and instead he says nothing. They get on
594.56s: the escalator, they go down, but then he
595.92s: gets behind them and he said to
598.92s: me, "I heard them conversing in their
602.24s: minds." I said, "Do you know that they
604.48s: weren't talking?" He says, "Look, I'm
605.84s: pretty damn sure they weren't talking.
607.36s: I'm hearing." What were they saying?
609.52s: Well, they were saying something like,
611.76s: "Yeah, he can hear us." "No, he's not
614.48s: important. he's not part of like part of
617.04s: the program or he's not part of he's not
619.04s: part of anything we need to worry about.
620.32s: At this point his wife interjected in
622.32s: the story. She was hilarious. She's
624.80s: like, "Oh yes, I remember this. My
627.04s: friend and I were peeking around the
628.80s: slot machines of this like hiding behind
632.72s: the slot machine." So that was kind of
634.80s: nice little confirmation there. But
636.24s: anyways, the couple gets down to the
637.68s: bottom of the escalator and they walk
639.76s: out and they're gone. So then the three
642.80s: of them are conferring and they're
645.80s: like that was crazy. So the the woman
649.04s: the psychic friend also did uh
651.68s: aggressive
652.68s: hypnosis and she says you know I could
656.24s: regress you Colonel uh so that maybe you
659.28s: can relax and and maybe you can remember
661.36s: if there's anything more that you can
662.88s: remember about what you think you heard.
664.96s: I guess that was the plan. So he's like
666.88s: all right cool. So he goes a day or two
669.36s: later, he's at her place in this
672.00s: culde-sac quiet neighborhood and he said
676.08s: every time that she tried to regress me,
678.08s: we heard like construction noise outside
680.00s: like jackhammers. He they would go out
682.48s: to look and they didn't see anything. So
685.12s: he says, "No biggie. I'll be back in
688.32s: about a month. Maybe we can get together
690.32s: and do this stench." He's like, "Great."
692.16s: So month later, he calls her. He says,
695.60s: "Hey, I'm going to be in town. Can we do
698.80s: that regression?" She says, "What
701.56s: regression?" The regression last month,
704.64s: Las Vegas. Apparently, she remembered
706.72s: nothing of this encounter. I have one
709.76s: more story that I have to tell you. And
711.52s: then in
713.88s: 2010, I had just put out a film called I
716.24s: Know What I Saw, which was a two-hour
717.52s: special I sold to History Channel. And
719.84s: uh I got a I got an email from Robert
722.84s: Bigalow and it said uh it was actually
725.44s: from a secretary. It said uh this is
727.60s: secretary, you know, Mr. Bigalow wanted
729.44s: me to reach out on his behalf that uh
732.48s: congratulations on a on a job well done
734.48s: with your doc. Wow. Robert Bigalow.
738.92s: Whoa. I emailed back like, "Hey, would
741.44s: he like to get together like maybe lunch
743.44s: or dinner, you know, discuss, you know,
745.04s: kind of some of my next moves?" Little
746.80s: did I know at the time he had just
748.16s: signed a contract just a couple years
749.76s: earlier, right, with OAP and ATIP. And
753.20s: uh she Yeah, sure. He'll he love he'd
755.60s: love to meet you. Come to his house. So
757.68s: I went to his house 2009 2010. I'd have
760.00s: to look it up the emails somewhere
761.68s: around there. And uh we we had lunch and
766.64s: he started talking about you know the
769.92s: implications of disclosure, the impacts
772.40s: on society. I remember him saying, you
774.40s: know, you take every scandal from Iran
777.04s: Contra to Monica Lewinsky, all these
779.68s: scandals in the history of like modern
781.68s: history and multiply them the impact
783.68s: those have had, multiply that by a
785.60s: million and that's the impact, you know,
787.68s: this reality would have on the on the on
789.76s: the general public. And I remember
791.52s: thinking, come on, like really, you
794.08s: really think? So I've always thought
795.68s: like, oh, you know, we really had this,
797.28s: you know, unifying effect on everybody.
798.64s: And then he goes, and uh they're walking
800.80s: among us. And I
804.20s: said, "What do you what do you mean?
806.96s: What do you mean they're walking among
808.16s: us?" He goes, "I mean exactly that.
809.84s: They're they're walking among
816.04s: us." I had had something happen to me a
819.28s: couple years earlier which I've never
820.96s: spoken about ever because I would
824.44s: know. And and even
828.60s: that when that happened, I didn't talk
831.28s: to anybody about it. Not even no one.
834.40s: And even when he told me that, I still
836.32s: didn't talk about
837.48s: it because I had saw something one time
842.08s: in 2007. So 2 years later, I'm in um
846.24s: Eerie, Pennsylvania. I got my table. I'm
848.56s: selling my little books to him, I think.
850.16s: And this very nice lady, she's about 60,
852.80s: walks up to my table with her husband
855.12s: and she says, "I got a story for you. C
857.28s: can I tell you?" Like, "Yeah." So, she
860.64s: says, "When I was 15 years old, it would
863.20s: be about
864.84s: 1965. Uh, I was in church in western
868.16s: Pennsylvania in a tiny little town with
870.08s: my mother." And she said, "In our town,
873.44s: everyone knew everyone, especially in
875.92s: church." So, she's in church.
878.80s: So she said, "In front of me, in front
881.04s: of the aisle ahead of us, were this
884.96s: blonde couple, male, female, come
887.36s: walking in." She says, "They were
889.28s: absolutely gorgeous. They looked like
891.88s: supermodels." She said they had this
893.92s: incredible blue clothing. I was looking
897.12s: at the fabric. She's 15year-old girl, so
899.20s: she's into fashion. She said, "I have
901.28s: never seen such
903.96s: incredible beautiful clothing." And
906.32s: she's she's marveling and thinking, why
909.12s: is no one else in this church looking at
910.88s: these two people? She said they stuck
912.56s: out like a sore thumb. It's like, you
915.36s: know, Marilyn Monroe and uh you know,
917.76s: Carrie Grant could not walk in them.
920.16s: Yeah.
 So, um but no one was noticing
922.64s: them apparently. And then she said to
924.24s: me, and that's when I heard them in my
927.40s: mind. And what she heard was one of them
933.20s: thinking to the other something like,
936.32s: "Well, we appear to be fitting in pretty
938.24s: well
939.40s: here." And she's like, and then and then
943.52s: one of them, maybe the same one, I don't
945.12s: know, said, "Except for the girl behind
947.44s: us who can hear us."
950.48s: And uh that's what she's like
952.80s: practically freaking out after that. She
955.44s: heard nothing. It's like they shut it
956.88s: down. The other thing she said about
958.40s: them is that they're in mass and they
960.00s: didn't really know how to This is a
961.20s: Catholic mass which I grew up doing. You
964.16s: know, sit in the old sign of the cross,
966.00s: all that. They're like looking around.
967.60s: They don't know what to do. So they
969.44s: clearly did not fit in.
 Just trying to
971.20s: fit in,
 right? So it gets better. So she
975.68s: goes through the whole mass. Mass ends.
978.64s: The couple is up and out and they book
982.40s: it out of the church and she decides I'm
986.24s: going after them and she's following.
988.24s: They go down this hill. There's a field
990.56s: and there's a wooded area. So, they're
993.36s: not going to a parking lot or a car. So,
996.24s: that's kind of interesting, too. Let's
997.84s: just like note that little discrep that
1000.80s: little bit. So, she's going across the
1003.68s: field. She's going down this the hill
1005.60s: and then she stops dead in her tracks.
1008.64s: She said, "Then I saw a third person at
1012.24s: the entrance of the wooded area." She
1015.04s: said,
 "Remember Lurch from the Adams
1018.16s: family?
 Looked just like that guy.
1020.08s: Terrifying.
 Very tall.
 Like a man in
1022.80s: black, but very tall. Kind of un gangly,
1025.12s: unggainainely tall. Hat and a black suit
1028.40s: apparently. And this beautiful blonde
1031.24s: supermodel couple from Venus or Pleaides
1034.64s: or wherever they're from walk past him
1037.36s: into the woods into the woods. He turns
1040.96s: around and follows them. And that was
1042.48s: her
1043.80s: story. I made eye contact with this
1046.24s: individual and it was like an immediate
1047.68s: and I'd never really like considered
1049.44s: this even in the realm of possibility.
1051.52s: And I still don't know what I think to
1053.44s: be honest with you, what I really
1054.80s: believe at the end of the day. But uh we
1057.92s: had a
1058.92s: telepathic just like that.
 Can you
1062.28s: describe what the situation
1065.24s: was and what this individual looked
1067.84s: like?
1069.60s: I I don't know if I want to go public
1071.76s: fully on where it was, but it happened
1073.92s: in Washington DC.
 Okay.
 Yeah. And uh the
1077.44s: individual looked like a normal
1079.04s: relatively a normal person.
1082.36s: Um and and the individual I remember was
1086.24s: doing like was like moving a chair or
1089.44s: something like that and he this
1091.04s: individual sensed that I was looking at
1094.80s: him for whatever reason kind of doing
1097.20s: this like maybe dragging a chair and
1098.96s: then turned around and looked me right
1101.28s: in the eyes and it was like holy
1105.12s: like in myself. I wasn't scared, but I
1108.72s: it was like a like you're not human like
1112.88s: but it was
1114.12s: really the individual knew that that was
1116.80s: the communication that the individual
1118.32s: gave to me and knew that I had received
1120.96s: it and
 it knew that you knew.
 Yes. Yes.
1124.72s: Like in in in an instant and I knew it
1127.20s: knew and it was I was okay. big blue
1130.96s: like electric blue eyes like like
1134.08s: piercing like freeze in your tracks when
1136.32s: you when you got eye when I made eye
1138.40s: contact. I never told a soul because I
1141.52s: sound like a crazy guy and I I I and I
1143.68s: don't know what I I don't even know what
1146.40s: I saw.
 I tell you what that was the
1148.72s: communication that happened and it
1150.08s: happened like that like like that and I
1152.80s: wasn't scared.
 What do they look like?
1154.88s: The eyes.
 No. What do the person look
1156.48s: like? Was it
 like a normal person? Dark
1158.08s: skin. Yeah.
 Um, relatively, uh, not sure
1162.24s: of the ethnicity. I'm not not Swedish or
1164.56s: anything. Wasn't like Scandinavian
 tall
1166.96s: particularly. Do you remember? Not tall.
1168.96s: Just regular looking.
 Yeah. Mhm.
 What
1171.52s: made you look in that direction?
 I don't
1173.04s: know.
 And I I I I just just remember it
1176.96s: was like, you know, and we It was
1179.84s: immediate. And you knew immediate
1182.56s: communication just bam like
1185.28s: that. And I wasn't scared. And then I
1187.52s: went about my business and I never
1188.80s: talked about it.
 But it stuck with you.
1190.24s: Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I didn't
1192.88s: believe it. I didn't even believe it.
1194.32s: You see my point? Like I didn't believe
1195.92s: that that happened to me. But then I'm
1198.16s: hearing other people talk about it. You
1199.68s: know, Timothy Good and then Piccolo, the
1202.72s: encounter, the alleged encounter in the
1204.32s: desert if from 2000 of 1994 in Nellis
1207.92s: test range that Mr. Sans talks about.
1210.48s: You know, I don't know. Did it happen?
1211.76s: Did
1212.68s: I do these things happen? Are they
1215.28s: walking among us? I don't know. I don't
1217.12s: know.
 The Travis one is the one I
1219.44s: consider to be the most important. When
1221.76s: he got from a from a distance, they look
1223.52s: 100% like humans, but the closer he got,
1226.64s: he said, and I looked at this one
1228.96s: person, he was very close to him, and he
1231.04s: said the eyes gave him away right away
1232.88s: that he's not human. So that totally got
1235.92s: my attention because I thought that that
1238.88s: is very peculiar to have this faction of
1243.68s: the story of Travis Walton who I think
1246.72s: has proven himself through the years
1249.28s: with lie detector tests and and
1251.04s: collaborative witness accounts that he
1254.00s: did have an experience and he insisted
1256.80s: of these tall humanlooking blonde beings
1259.92s: that were there. Two males and one
1261.60s: female.
 Crazy strong too. very strong.
1263.92s: They were like even the women put him
1266.16s: down effortlessly.
 He mean he was he's a
1268.40s: 6'2 big guy
 big guy very m at the time
1271.20s: he was in yeah he's he's in the
 top of
1274.00s: his of his shape at at that time. So he
1277.04s: was very he said I was very strong and
1279.36s: they were able to to to move me very
1283.20s: easily like if it was a a mechanical
1285.44s: thing moving him. So that's that means
1288.08s: they're they're stronger. They also had
1291.16s: the wildest, most sci-fi feature about
1294.88s: them other than the suits they were
1296.24s: wearing. They were they had fishbowls.
1298.72s: Now, this is something straight out of
1299.92s: the Jetsons.
1301.64s: And the only reason I found that
1304.16s: intriguing is because there is another
1306.40s: case in the UK of a lady seeing a saucer
1310.80s: just hanging in the air and the
1311.92s: occupants being blonde. That's right.
1314.00s: Also had fishbowls.
 That's right. All I
1316.72s: can describe this huge Mexican
1320.04s: hat. It was stationary, this thing, and
1323.44s: it was bright silver in color. And it
1325.92s: had a dome. A dome. It was
1330.12s: tilted to sort of I could see the
1333.52s: occupants in it.
 You saw people in it.
 I
1336.08s: saw people in it. There were two people
1337.76s: in there.
1340.12s: Um, these
1341.96s: people were beautiful people. That's the
1344.72s: only way I can describe them. Um, they
1348.16s: had long golden hair like a page boy
1350.72s: page boy Bob just like the old kings.
1353.44s: You used to see photographs of the old
1355.20s: kings and the the color of the hair was
1357.60s: golden. Now I was really dressed in they
1362.88s: had a sort of a neck jumper affair like
1365.92s: a ski top suit
 in a in pale blue. Now,
1371.44s: these people weren't sat behind one
1373.60s: behind the other. They were sat
1375.04s: together. But this, whatever it was, was
1377.60s: tilted so that I could see them and they
1380.80s: could see me. They had beautiful faces.
1382.80s: I shall never forget their faces as long
1384.48s: as I live. Their foreheads seem to be a
1387.36s: bit larger than, you know, the the
1391.36s: bottom of their faces as as normal
1393.72s: people you would expect to see.
1397.12s: But um maybe this is what was was just
1398.88s: the whatever they had around their heads
1401.44s: which was like a transparent
1404.20s: fishbowl and they just looked and I was
1407.44s: absolutely paralytic with fear. I
1409.20s: couldn't move although my mind was
1410.72s: ticking
1412.20s: over and they looked so sympathetic.
1415.55s: [Music]
1418.16s: Um but it's the mantises that seem to be
1420.56s: calling the shots. So I'm very
1422.08s: interested in them. And the personal
1423.68s: side of it is I dig mantises. So, I I
1426.48s: had this um I have a mantis sanctuary at
1429.04s: my home. I I I had a I found this thing
1433.12s: floating in my pool. It's now 10 years
1435.24s: ago and I thought it was a piece of wood
1438.96s: and I scooped it out and I realized, oh
1440.88s: man, it's a praying mantis. Looks like
1442.72s: it's dead. You know what? I'm going to
1444.00s: put it over here in the in the courtyard
1445.76s: and see if it comes back alive. I come
1447.60s: out a half hour later, open the front
1449.60s: door, there's that damn mantis at the
1451.36s: doors stop looking up trying to get in
1453.76s: the house. I go, "No, no, no. Hold on
1455.52s: there, little buddy." Scooped it up and
1457.52s: I put it, we have a flower bed. And in
1460.00s: the spring, we grow mint and it flowers.
1462.32s: I put it in there. Best of luck to you.
1465.20s: And that was a girl mantis because every
1468.40s: year since then on the 1st of May, I get
1471.28s: a crop of mantises. And I made it into a
1473.76s: sanctuary. I protect it. I don't let any
1475.60s: yard guy come in. I don't let any
1477.76s: insecticides be sprayed there. But at
1480.56s: first it was a dozen mantises that I
1483.76s: were born. Suddenly I've got a bunch of
1485.84s: them. The second and third year it's
1488.16s: several dozen. Then it was hundreds. And
1491.60s: um and then we had a a year each year
1494.32s: gets a little harder because the climate
1496.24s: is changing whether people want to admit
1497.76s: it or not. But I protect that like it's
1500.32s: my own children. Um I I put up fences to
1503.44s: keep people and animals and danger away
1506.24s: from those mattises. And um you know,
1508.40s: it's part of it is because I just think
1509.68s: they're little fascinating creatures.
1511.12s: They're amazing. And then as I'm going
1513.92s: through UFO research, I learned that um
1517.60s: about these manted beings. And I
1519.44s: figured, well, you know, it doesn't help
1521.52s: to be in good with the mantises. When
1523.20s: the 8-ft tall ones land, maybe they put
1525.92s: a good word in with our new mantis
1527.68s: overlords. And I'm I'm only partially
1530.40s: joking about that, but uh but I I love
1532.88s: the mantises. I I protect them. I dig
1535.36s: them. They come back every year.
1537.44s: this year was I didn't know if I was
1539.20s: going to have any left or not because so
1541.12s: many of the adults ended up dead for one
1543.20s: reason or another last year and I didn't
1544.88s: see any of these little mantis condo
1547.20s: towers that they are like egg sacks that
1549.44s: they leave. I didn't see any new ones.
1551.12s: So, I didn't know if they were going to
1552.16s: come out until April 30th. I saw two
1556.32s: little mantises and I was just happy as
1558.00s:  And then May 1st, boom, there they
1560.16s: are. Like right on like they've got a
1561.52s: calendar or something. They
 every May
1563.28s: 1st.
 Yeah, every May 1st for This is the
1565.68s: 10th year. There was this story. Was it
1568.32s: called the mantis? This documentary
 man
1571.20s: versus mantis.
 Man versus mantis. This
1573.28s: was fascinating to me.
 So that was like
1576.00s: right in the middle of my mantis
1578.16s: experiment, my sanctuary. As I somebody
1580.56s: sent that story to me. I reached out to
1582.40s: that guy. I had him on coast to coast.
1584.32s: He's a musician and a filmmaker, a
1586.56s: fascinating guy, serious, smart, funny
1589.52s: as hell. And he told me about this man
1591.68s: versus man experience. And it what
1594.00s: happened to him has happened to so many
1595.52s: other people is that once you connect
1597.52s: with the mandises on some level you
1599.52s: start seeing them everywhere and maybe
1600.96s: it's just your awareness grows or
1602.64s: something like that or but in his life
1605.52s: suddenly it spread to everyone in his
1607.12s: family um they're seeing mantises all
1609.52s: over the place and
 have you ever had an
1611.84s: encounter with a mantis that wasn't uh
1614.32s: in my garden?
1615.88s: No I have not. That'd be pretty cool.
1619.20s: Scary as hell but it'd be pretty cool. I
1621.84s: hope so someday.
 What's your conviction
1624.40s: on these mantids being real?
1630.08s: I'd say somewhere around 60%. Um I don't
1633.84s: really know. Here's what I don't know.
 I
1636.56s: don't know what they really look like.
1638.32s: You know what what we have learned from
1639.92s: this phenomena in the big picture. Not
1642.24s: only did the the ships change shapes,
1644.88s: but the beings change shapes. Um, and
1647.52s: sometimes it happens while abductees are
1650.16s: on board these craft, if it's really
1651.92s: that craft. They manipulate our
1653.84s: perceptions in so many ways. I'm not
1656.08s: sure we really know what any of them
1657.44s: look
1658.33s: [Music]
1664.52s: like. I tend to think more of like
1667.40s: intradimensional. And the reason I
1669.36s: started doing DMT after maybe having
1671.44s: done lots of drugs in my younger days is
1673.68s: that I see it as perhaps not a
1677.64s: hallucinogenic psychedelic drug but a
1680.24s: plant medicine technology that allows us
1682.84s: access. So if I had to pick a
1686.36s: favorite, I would say yeah, maybe the
1688.88s: machine elves in the DMT realm because I
1691.52s: have a feeling that aliens as we know
1693.68s: them are probably AI. They've gone
1696.16s: through their own Kersswian singularity
1698.32s: probably millions of years more advanced
1699.92s: than us and then can perhaps instantiate
1702.24s: as needed in biological synthetic form
1705.44s: and that DMT denisens so to speak are in
1709.92s: turn billions of years more advanced
1712.32s: than us and I asked them during a DMT
1715.84s: session are you what we feel to be
1719.04s: aliens and UFOs and the answer I got
1721.48s: back trillions of miles of synapses
1723.92s: firing was we can't explain in a way
1726.32s: that you would understand.
1728.96s: That's powerful but also convenient.
1731.68s: Well, and it's not it didn't feel to me
1733.68s: like deflecting. Sure.
 But it it felt to
1735.76s: me like, okay, if an ant is looking at a
1738.08s: Chevrolet transmission, what are they
1739.84s: going to understand? Even if that you
1741.84s: started explaining
 there's no point.
 And
1743.44s: so,
 and I that's not no. And it just
1747.52s: seems to me a lot of people, especially
1749.76s: at this conference, my good friends are
1751.28s: working on disclosure. They got that
1752.64s: covered. So, I'm going the end round.
1754.64s: the exposure to see if I can't do the
1757.12s: Andrew Gallammorian route of going to
1759.84s: the source. And I think that's where
1761.92s: they are. That's where they're going to
1763.12s: be and where we're going to be. If we
1765.52s: can survive this transition, I'm less
1767.68s: afraid about the future of artificial
1769.28s: intelligence than the present of human
1770.96s: stupidity. We might not make it until a
1773.20s: singularity. Uh, one that I found very
1775.84s: interesting, we're filming an episode of
1778.24s: Australian TV show. They're doing like a
1780.00s: different psychedelic each episode. I'm
1781.44s: the DMT guy. And so we had a husband and
1784.24s: wife doing DMT and the wife was crying.
1788.16s: I mean deep sobbing the whole time. And
1790.96s: for those of us who've done
1791.92s: psychedelics, that's not necessarily
1793.44s: bad. This is not fun and games. It's
1795.68s: more like work. It could be therapy. And
1798.48s: so afterwards, we asked her on camera,
1800.72s: what did you experience? And this wasn't
1803.04s: so much an other entity story, but I'm
1805.76s: going to loop it back around. She said
1807.92s: that she saw the creation of her
1811.40s: soul and felt the attendant fear her not
1817.08s: yet instantiated soul felt about
1821.20s: assuming human form and that helped her
1824.32s: understand some of her legacy fears that
1827.52s: she carries with her today.
1830.16s: First time I did DMT and I asked that
1832.08s: question, I felt that I saw the creators
1836.00s: of the very fabric of the universe and I
1838.28s: saw the universe, the new material being
1842.08s: bubbled up and I saw the people around
1843.92s: almost like a cauldron, like a galactic
1845.44s: cauldron.
 What What do they look like
1846.64s: these people?
 Do you have a Do you have
1848.80s: like a a clear image or like a hazy
1851.04s: image or
 I don't Chris. Um I don't see
1854.32s: so much. I feel them,
 right? and I felt
1857.20s: them around there and I'm feeling wow
1859.76s: this this is the work of the universe
1863.04s: and the other feeling I had was I'm on
1865.36s: the other side of the universe but I'm
1867.68s: home and then later that night when I I
1870.00s: I circle back to DMT a lot I I did
1872.80s: another session and this time it
1876.60s: was the universe coming into me and
1879.52s: healing me of emotional
1881.40s: trauma and I'm trying to receive it as
1883.84s: much as I can two weeks later do it
1885.76s: again and it said to me, "Welcome back,
1889.20s: Paul. Let's resume where we left off
1891.04s: last time." So, the universe remembered
1892.56s: me by name and remembered our last
1894.32s: appointment.
 Like a therapy session.
1896.16s: Yeah. So, I I find these things, these
1900.16s: types of experiences, again, it seems to
1903.20s: for
1904.28s: me blur the lines between others and
1907.28s: ourselves and whether those others are
1909.60s: consistent permanent state entities or
1912.40s: if they may meld into others. What is
1914.56s: your
1915.40s: conviction on this particular type being
1919.68s: real? Is it very high?
 I can 100%.
 That
1922.32s: they exist
 that they exist.
 Do you think
1924.00s: they're among us? These ones?
 I believe
1925.68s: so. I don't know about 100% on that
1927.92s: because it's I I believe 100% that they
1931.40s: exist, that they live among us. My
1935.28s: conviction is maybe 95%. So I give 5% to
1939.84s: who knows it could be complete, you
1942.88s: know. bad misperceptions of people and
1945.92s: you always have to leave a little bit. I
1948.08s: do believe they exist. I don't know if
1950.08s: they're among us.
 What's your conviction
1952.88s: on these mantids being real?
1958.56s: I'd say somewhere around 60%.
 Um, what's
1962.00s: your conviction on the Nordics being
1964.24s: real?
1967.76s: All low. It's low on everything. Yeah.
 I
1970.72s: don't know. I the way I look at UFO
1973.12s: research is
1974.52s: uh that's not true. They're gradations
1977.04s: of probability. There being a phenomena
1979.12s: that's real, I'm very high conviction.
1980.88s: Yeah, of course. Reality being weirder
1982.40s: than we think. Very
 specific
 specific
1984.96s: Nordic. Super low. Um
 super low but not
1988.08s: zero.
 Not zero. Not zero. Yeah.
 High low
1992.96s: 50%
 at this point. At this point
 I'm at
1996.00s: 80%.
1998.08s: It's pretty high.
 Yeah. Because if I had
2000.72s: I was thinking about actually when I was
2001.76s: doing labs in the pool. I was thinking
2003.04s: to myself if I had to like someone said
2006.00s: you got to make a decision. You have to
2007.44s: make either yes or no. I was like I it
2010.08s: would be yes. It would be yes because if
2012.72s: it was a no I would have to dismiss so
2015.76s: many testimonies. I'd have to dismiss
2018.00s: all them including my own.
 Oh of the
2021.04s: human looking type.
 Yes.
 Yeah. I would
2022.64s: say 99 to 100%. I I have very little
2025.20s: doubt at this point. I mean it could be
2027.60s: anywhere. And I I do think there's
2029.20s: enough evidence in different fields to
2031.36s: suggest, let's say, metataterrestrials
2034.40s: that there's something beyond our
2035.76s: current awareness, something beyond
2037.28s: super secret military
2039.32s: capabilities. And I think there are is
2041.60s: an other. And you ask if they're real.
2044.48s: So I think there's an objective reality
2046.08s: to them, but there was kind of a nuance
2048.56s: and I want to tease out what you said
2049.76s: about are they real in how they appear.
2052.56s: That may not be the case. They may
2053.84s: instantiate. And I have a hunch that a
2055.60s: lot of things that we sort of silo as
2057.76s: different phenomena may be essentially
2060.64s: the same. There may be this root level
2063.40s: of Kurtakian consciousness that manifest
2067.12s: in different ways for different reasons.
2069.20s: You've got stories even go back
2070.88s: centuries
2072.72s: uh at times of
2075.00s: intriguing encounters with beings that
2077.44s: don't seem like they come from here. In
2078.96s: one of my books uh I recounted a story
2081.60s: from a guy named uh the hell was his
2083.04s: name? Fazio
2084.28s: Cardano. He was uh 16th century Italian
2089.04s: lawyer and uh I think he was a doctor,
2092.00s: physician, a brilliant man. His
2094.76s: father Gerro Lammo Cardano was a friend
2097.52s: of Leonardo da Vinci. So he's a very
2100.08s: like high level people. So Fazio
2102.72s: Cardano, who was known throughout
2104.24s: Europe, he was a brilliant man. He said,
2105.76s: "My father uh told me for years of an
2108.96s: encounter he had with this group of I
2111.04s: think five guys who came into his studio
2114.64s: one day and um told him
2118.92s: about he said, "We've been observing
2121.04s: your people for many many years." He
2123.76s: says, "Who are you people? What are you
2125.28s: like?" Apparently they live for hundreds
2126.80s: of years. He says, "Do you believe in
2128.56s: God?" And he said, "They looked at each
2131.12s: other and and they had they didn't all
2132.80s: have the same opinion on that."
 Whoa.
2134.96s: like in the same way like
 that's that's
2138.56s: a wonderful little
 it's a very
2140.48s: interesting yeah
2142.28s: um so a story like that I think I don't
2147.52s: I can't just throw that out it it comes
2149.60s: from it's 500 years old but Fazio
2153.92s: Cardano is a known highlevel individual
2156.96s: of his time had a very high reputation
2159.04s: he's just telling this crazy story he's
2161.12s: not talking about aliens
 no
 but these
2163.52s: were humanl looking beings He said their
2165.44s: robes, their clothing was like perfect.
2168.08s: It's like amazing.
2170.32s: Uh I don't know. I can't remember if he
2172.08s: gave it colors. If star to star travel
2174.40s: is possible, then let's go back in time
2177.88s: forever for millions and billions of
2180.56s: years. Various entities, various species
2183.28s: were able to move around the galaxy and
2186.32s: and and and where they really was their
2188.48s: interest, right? We want to check out
2189.84s: those moon rocks, you know, or uh you
2192.00s: know, just look at stars. They probably
2193.76s: teach their kids how stars work. The
2196.48s: only thing worth looking for in this
2198.64s: galaxy is life without question. Most
2202.00s: complicated thing we know and some life
2204.48s: forms might be more complicated than us.
2206.32s: And so they are moving around going to a
2208.40s: planet with life taking some samples of
2210.72s: it to study work with right and then
2213.76s: maybe giving somebody else. What I'm
2216.16s: trying to say is that logic says that
2217.88s: life types, forms, daily, whatever, has
2221.36s: been spread all around the galaxy by
2224.40s: civilizations that have come and gone.
2226.48s: They've taken and and they're working
2228.16s: with it. And so they they may be working
2229.92s: with DNA from 100,000 light years from
2232.40s: here and yet working with some of our
2234.08s: DNA. In other words, it is we are
2236.00s: connected already
2237.88s: galactically, genetically in a sense the
2240.72s: the life the life essence and whatever
2243.04s: forms DNA and other versions have been
2245.20s: taken and moved and integrated and what
2246.96s: have you and they've taken stuff from us
2249.52s: as well. And so that makes this much
2252.72s: more profound. If we can go to the stars
2255.60s: eventually we're going to learn that we
2257.36s: have a connection of various levels with
2259.76s: major parts of the galaxy that is a
2261.84s: fully living entity. makes Gaia look
2263.92s: almost pale in comparison.
 Which then
2266.40s: brings me to uh
2272.44s: this. We are about to get disclosure. It
2275.68s: is a long time coming. It's not like the
2277.60s: ancient times when they would come down
2280.16s: and they were just gods. That was just
2281.68s: that was it. You're gods. Okay. You're
2283.36s: gods. So if you're an ET, you need a god
2285.44s: time. Be treated like a god. Like a
2287.44s: vacation. Come to the earth and worship
2289.28s: the hell out of here.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 This
2291.28s: is not like that. We are an advanced
2293.12s: technological space fairy civilization
2295.04s: on the and we have massive weapons.
2296.80s: We're about to get more and we may have
2298.40s: inter interstellar travel pretty
2300.92s: soon. So this is a coming out party.
2303.44s: It's a bar mitzvah. It's the biggest
2305.20s: paradigm shift in history. We're only at
2307.52s: the beginning of of a kind of probably a
2309.68s: fundamental re understanding of of
2313.28s: reality like
2316.04s: um having the ability to manipulate and
2319.76s: control reality like like alchemists and
2323.20s: magicians. I I actually think that we're
2325.60s: we're probably getting close to that.
2329.28s: Um and and I think and and when we get
2333.12s: there, we're going to have a completely
2334.80s: different understanding of like what's
2336.56s: the substrate of reality. I I I'm
2338.40s: starting to think it's probably just
2339.56s: information and and intelligence is
2342.28s: simply organized information get to a
2346.24s: higher level of awareness what we might
2347.92s: call consciousness.
2351.16s: And and we we're now at we're just we're
2354.56s: just vessels for intelligence. That's
2356.64s: really I think where we are and they are
2359.96s: operating at a level of complex
2363.00s: information that we are not yet there
2366.72s: but we're we're improving by leaps and
2369.20s: bounds. So I wonder if in another let's
2373.92s: say 50 100
2375.96s: years we
2377.88s: are we might be able to have a
2380.00s: conversation with them about about the
2382.64s: nature of reality particularly if
2386.36s: we are able to I mean this is crazy and
2389.76s: it terrifies me to be honest with you
2391.84s: but like to create like a superhuman
2393.60s: being genetic enhancement. and we can
2395.52s: live for 500 years and we have genetic
2399.36s: uh intelligence now that's vastly
2401.60s: greater than what you and I have but
2403.76s: it's not impossible right you know we're
2406.24s: we're remaking ourselves as a species
2408.72s: right now right now and it's and that's
2412.08s: why actually when you look around the
2414.00s: world is it's crazy mental illness is
2417.24s: high why because we're going through
2420.16s: this incredibly rapid transformation as
2423.36s: a species and Like no one has to be
2425.76s: here. No one has to be dropped into
2427.84s: this. But like everything's changing so
2430.16s: amazingly fast. And and I think they the
2433.28s: observers, the monitors, the
2435.08s: manipulators, they see it all. They
2437.60s: know. And and we're just we're just
2440.32s: riding through this. We have no control.
2442.48s: We have no control over this. We really
2445.76s: we overestimate our power and our
2448.48s: control and our ability to navigate
2450.72s: this. We're not navigating man.
2453.04s: We're we're on a high-speed train and
2456.00s: it's got tracks and we argue over, you
2459.28s: know, like should we have guard rails on
2461.76s: AI or not? Like, are you kidding me?
2463.92s: None of that's going to matter. We can't
2466.24s: stop it. We can't help ourselves. This
2468.72s: is just going and so where will we be a
2472.48s: 100 years from now? They'll say, "Well,
2473.84s: we shouldn't do genetic modifications of
2475.76s: human beings." Well, someone's going to
2477.20s: do it. Doesn't really matter what you
2478.96s: think. It's going to happen. So where
2481.60s: we're going to be out in a century or
2484.24s: two is going to be a very different
2486.00s: place. Not just a different
2487.44s: civilization, not just a different
2489.12s: economy, not just different human
2491.64s: psychology, not just human capabilities,
2494.84s: cybernetic, but like a almost the
2497.52s: beginnings of a variation of a human
2499.76s: species.
2501.28s: Clearly, whoever they are, and I think
2503.44s: there could be different races, getting
2505.20s: back to your question about favorites,
2507.20s: they're not here with purely hostile
2509.04s: intent because almost overwhelmingly in
2512.16s: all their accounts, they're more
2513.20s: powerful than us, and they would have
2514.64s: killed us if that was their intent. So,
2516.76s: at at worst, they're here to manipulate
2519.52s: us in some way.
 Mhm.
 Um, and at best,
2523.20s: they're benevolent
 or us.
2528.00s: It is extremely uh dangerous for us to
2531.84s: assume anything in regards to them being
2535.64s: collaborating or independently have
2538.72s: different agendas because we just can't
2542.36s: assume that the species all have one
2546.80s: species all have the same agenda just
2550.72s: because they're the same species. But
2553.28s: one thing that I've been talking about
2554.56s: recently and one thing that really rings
2556.00s: true to me is this idea of belief and I
2558.96s: I I kind of like try to do away with it
2561.12s: a little bit and I'm not I'm not here to
2563.12s: believe. It doesn't matter what I
2564.32s: believe. What who cares what I believe?
2566.00s: It sounds like me when I started this 30
2567.44s: years ago. It's like I don't I don't
2568.64s: care what I think. You will want to
2570.40s: start putting it together and asking
2572.32s: yourself what do I really think? cuz
2575.04s: like I I' I've gone through that whole
2576.56s: phase and then
 maybe 5 10 years ago I
2578.80s: started thinking
2581.12s: I've looked at this long enough.
 Do I
2583.52s: really just want to pretend that I don't
2585.04s: have opinions?
 Yeah,
 it'll happen. It
2587.04s: all it always does.
 Well, you're a great
2588.72s: inspiration to me and a lot of people.
2590.16s: So, I really appreciate it, Richard.
2591.44s: Thank you.
 Total pleasure. Sitting down
2594.00s: with these experts was a truly
2595.84s: enlightening experience and I'm grateful
2598.32s: for the time they've given me. There's
2600.40s: much to ponder and so much left to
2602.88s: discover.
2605.28s: I hope you enjoyed this video and again
2607.76s: if you want to see the full unconut
2609.20s: versions of these interviews I've left
2610.88s: the link below.
