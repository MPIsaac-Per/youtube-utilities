2.64s: Hey, my name is Josh. When I was about
5.84s: 11 years old, I was in my living room.
8.88s: It was about 1:00 a.m. Everybody else in
11.12s: the house was asleep, and all of a
12.96s: sudden, I started seeing like a orange
15.44s: glow outside of my front window. We
17.76s: lived right next to an airport, so I
19.60s: really didn't think much of anything of
21.20s: it. Well, the glow started getting
23.04s: brighter and brighter and brighter, and
24.80s: I started hearing a low hum. Um, and it
28.00s: wasn't like an electronic hum that I've
30.32s: heard before. So, I kind of started
32.40s: freaking out a little bit, like, what's
34.16s: going on? Is there a helicopter getting
35.92s: close to my apartment? You know, I just
38.56s: really didn't know. So, I got up and
40.24s: looked outside and what I saw was a
42.96s: discshaped
44.28s: object hovering probably about 4 or 500
47.44s: ft
48.28s: away from the apartment up in the sky.
53.44s: Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Chris
55.28s: Ramsey and welcome back to yet another
57.68s: episode of Debriefed. And today we are
59.68s: going to be continuing our readthrough
61.92s: of the alien interview by Lawrence R.
65.12s: Spencer. Uh, allegedly 1947, this nurse
69.12s: was given permission or she was the only
71.52s: one able to communicate with the last
73.88s: surviving alien that crashed at Roswell
77.20s: and since then has sent her notes to the
80.64s: author here. And he took the transcripts
83.28s: verbatim and published them here. And
85.12s: this is basically a discussion between a
87.92s: person and an alien. And the alien uh
90.24s: known as Errol, who identifies as an
94.40s: Isby, an Isby being the spirit that
97.36s: inhabits all living sentient beings,
100.00s: including ourselves, has revealed to us
102.56s: that they've been monitoring and
105.28s: visiting Earth for thousands of years.
108.56s: And Arrol, as a matter of fact, is over,
112.88s: I think, close to half a billion years
114.72s: old. I don't know. This story gets a
117.12s: little wild. And starting now it gets
120.60s: even wilder. Before we get started,
123.12s: there are multiple ways that you guys
124.32s: can help out Area 52. If you want to do
126.40s: that for free, you know, obviously leave
129.68s: a like, subscribe, hit the notification
132.48s: bell, but also if you're listening to
134.24s: this on iTunes or Spotify, uh, leave us
137.04s: a review there. A fivestar review goes a
139.36s: long way. If you want to take it one
141.12s: step further, you can visit area52.shop.
143.76s: We got some merch. Not much left because
146.08s: it keeps selling out. uh thanks to you
148.32s: guys. But we got some stuff there that
149.84s: you guys can check out. And lastly, if
152.08s: you really want to support what we do,
154.00s: go ahead and and become an intern at
156.16s: Area 52, otherwise known as joining the
158.64s: memberships or the Patreon. You get
160.88s: weekly vlogs, access to the archive, and
163.92s: so much more, including early access to
166.96s: these videos. So, all of the interns
169.12s: actually got these videos early. If you
171.52s: want to do that, go ahead and do that.
172.64s: Folks, we paid the bills. It is time to
175.44s: continue with our read through. Let's
176.72s: get into it. Yeah, we left off talking
178.40s: about how space travel technologies
182.08s: started 80 trillion years ago. Yeah, I
184.80s: guess quick little reminder to check the
186.72s: disbelief at the door at least for the
188.80s: next hour or so. You know, it'll be
190.48s: right where you left it when you choose
192.16s: to pick it back up. But I often like
194.72s: reminding people that, you know, you you
196.80s: don't have to be religious to read the
198.56s: Bible. And you you don't have to be a
200.80s: physicist to read physics books.
202.60s: Although you probably have to be a
204.56s: physics physicist to understand what's
206.16s: in the physics books, but you can read
207.52s: them without becoming a physicist,
209.52s: right? And that's kind of what this is
211.28s: about. We're reading something that
213.36s: might be fiction, but that doesn't mean
215.28s: we have to believe it. This whole
217.20s: believe it or don't believe it thing
219.28s: frankly annoys me a little bit. You
221.12s: know, when people are like, "Do you
222.16s: believe in that or do you not believe in
223.52s: that?" Or, "I don't believe this guy. I
225.28s: believe that guy. This guy's lying. I
226.96s: don't believe him. He's telling the
228.24s: truth." Just it's information. Take it
231.04s: in. Don't believe anything. Don't not
233.52s: believe anything. Why do you have to
235.44s: commit to something? Why is everything
236.96s: so binary? Just absorb the
241.32s: information and that's it. Only when we
244.56s: have a strong conviction about something
246.24s: do we become defensive about that
247.92s: stance. And that's usually what we're
249.20s: seeing in these arguments in the
250.40s: community and everything else. So, you
251.92s: know, just just take it take take it as
254.00s: information. All right, let's go. Errol
255.92s: described the abilities of an Isby
257.68s: officer of the domain to me and she
260.32s: demonstrated one to me when she
262.00s: contacted telepathically a
263.84s: communications officer of the domain who
265.84s: is stationed in the asteroid belt. Whoa.
268.48s: So, she's got Arrol's got some type of
271.04s: instant Wi-Fi, you know, communication
273.84s: going here with uh with the domain in
276.72s: the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is
279.20s: composed of thousands of broken up
280.72s: pieces of a planet that once existed
282.72s: between Mars and Jupiter. It serves as a
285.52s: good lowgravity jumping off point for
287.76s: incoming spacecraft traveling toward the
289.92s: center of our
291.64s: galaxy. She requested that this officer
294.32s: consult information stored in the files
296.80s: of the domain concerning the history of
299.20s: Earth. She asked the communications
301.20s: officer to feed this information to
303.52s: Arrol. The communications officer
305.76s: immediately complied with the request.
307.76s: Based on the information stored in the
309.44s: files of the domain, Errol was able to
311.36s: give me a brief overview or history
313.60s: lesson. This is what Errol told me that
315.52s: the domain had observed about the
317.76s: history of Earth. Okay, here we go. She
321.44s: told me that the domain expeditionary
323.44s: force first entered the Milky Way galaxy
325.92s: very recently, only about 10,000 years
329.00s: ago. Their first action was to conquer
331.76s: the home planets of the Old Empire.
335.36s: This is not the official name, but a
336.96s: nickname given to the conquered
338.40s: civilization by the domain forces, the
340.80s: old empire that served as the seat of
342.96s: central government for this galaxy and
345.44s: other adjoining regions of space. These
348.24s: planets are located in the star systems
350.32s: in the tail of the big dipper
352.04s: constellation. She did not mention which
354.24s: stars exactly. About 1500 years later,
357.28s: the domain began the installation bases
360.08s: for their forces along the path of
361.76s: invasion, which led towards the center
363.76s: of this galaxy and beyond. About 8,200
366.88s: years ago, the domain forces set up a
369.52s: base on Earth in the Himalaya mountains
372.00s: near the border of modern Pakistan and
374.84s: Afghanistan. This was a base for a
377.44s: battalion of the domain expeditionary
379.60s: force which included about 3,000
382.24s: members.
384.72s: This is sounding a lot more like Star
387.08s: Wars. And you know that the beauty about
390.96s: Star Wars and the reason why I think it
392.72s: gained so much popularity is because at
394.88s: some level it resonates true with with
398.56s: our own perspective of what the universe
401.28s: or what the galaxies might be like if
403.60s: they were inhabited by, you know, an
407.12s: empire. And that's the one thing I will
409.12s: say about this topic in particular,
411.92s: especially when I hear about the
412.96s: Galactic Federation and things like
414.56s: that. Like I want nothing more, let's be
416.80s: clear, than for all of this to be
419.32s: real. I mean, if this is real, then it's
423.68s: then to some extent Jedi Force and
427.04s: lightsabers are real, right? I mean,
430.08s: where are we going to draw the line
431.32s: here? All right. They set up a base
433.76s: under or inside the top of a mountain.
436.08s: The mountain was drilled into and made
438.32s: hollow to create an area large enough to
440.40s: house the ships and personnel of that
442.48s: force. An electronic illusion of the
445.36s: mountaintop was created to hide the base
447.76s: by projecting a false image from inside
450.08s: the mountain against a force screen. The
454.16s: ships could then enter and exit through
455.92s: the force screen yet remain unseen by
458.24s: homo sapiens. This is interesting
460.96s: because Lerta in the Lerta files which
463.60s: we've read which was a reptilian who you
465.84s: know they said they lived underground
467.44s: they also had something similar wasn't a
469.92s: force screen necessarily unless we're
472.48s: talking about the same thing but I think
474.16s: the one that Lucerta described was
475.84s: something that interfaced with human
478.16s: beings perception of things. So they
480.00s: didn't actually have to distort anything
482.48s: visually. They just had to distort the
484.48s: impression of it in our minds. Shortly
486.80s: after they settled there, the base was
488.80s: surprised by an attack from a remnant of
491.60s: the military forces of the old empire.
495.44s: Unbeknouncsted to the domain, a hidden
497.92s: underground base on Mars operated by the
500.40s: old empire had existed for a very long
503.12s: time. The domain base was wiped out by
505.68s: the military attack from the Mars base
508.00s: and the Isbes of the domain
509.84s: expeditionary force were captured.
513.28s: You can imagine that the domain was very
515.28s: upset about losing such a large force of
517.44s: officers and crew. So they sent other
520.32s: crews to Earth to look for them. Those
523.04s: crews were also attacked. The captured
525.60s: isbes from the domain forces were
527.44s: handled in the same fashion as all other
529.84s: Isbes who have been sent to Earth. They
532.48s: were each given
534.12s: amnesia, had their memories replaced
536.48s: with false pictures and hypnotic
538.72s: commands, and sent to Earth to inhabit
540.96s: biological
543.32s: bodies. They are still a part of the
546.48s: human population today. Whoa. Hold on a
551.04s: second. Wait, what? What are we talking
553.52s: about here? Are we saying
555.80s: that some of these isbes are among us
559.20s: and they don't know it?
562.04s: Whoa. After a very persistent and
564.72s: extensive investigation into the loss of
566.80s: their crews, the domain discovered that
568.80s: Old Empire had been operating a very
571.92s: extensive and carefully hidden base of
574.56s: operations in this part of the galaxy
576.88s: for millions of years. No one knows
579.84s: exactly how long. Eventually, the
582.40s: spacecraft of the old Empire forces and
584.64s: the domain engaged each other in open
587.12s: combat in the space of the solar system.
591.12s: I wonder if this could be the war that
593.12s: Lerta was also referring to, but I feel
595.20s: like that war was much older, but
597.12s: perhaps this is No, actually it was that
599.36s: because it was like the younger dest,
600.96s: right? It was like 10,000 years ago or
602.64s: something like that. According to Arrol,
605.60s: there was a running battle between the
607.04s: Old Empire forces and the domain until
609.44s: about 1235
611.48s: AD when the domain forces finally
614.32s: destroyed the last spacecraft of the old
616.32s: empire. The domain expeditionary force
619.68s: lost so many of its own ships in this
621.68s: area during that time. Also, about a
624.24s: thousand years later, the Old Empire
626.48s: base was discovered by accident in the
628.88s: spring of 1914.
631.12s: The discovery was made when the body of
633.04s: an arch duke of Austria was taken over
636.88s: in quotes by an officer of the domain
638.96s: expeditionary force. This officer who
641.28s: was stationed in the asteroid belt was
643.44s: sent to Earth on a routine mission to
645.28s: gather reconnaissance. Okay, hold on.
647.36s: So, they sent one of the Isby spirits
650.12s: down to take over this Archduke of
653.76s: Austria. Now, we got a footnote here.
655.92s: I'm curious to know who this
658.04s: archduke might be. France Ferdinand.
661.28s: Whoa. Okay. He was an Archduke of
663.20s: Austria, Prince of Imperial of Austria,
665.60s: and Prince Royal of Hungary in Bohemia.
667.92s: But here we go. 1914, June 28th at 11:15
670.80s: a.m. France Ferdinand and his wife were
672.32s: killed in Sievo. The event known as the
674.88s: assassination Sievo, which triggered
676.96s: World War I. So, the purpose of the
679.72s: takeover was to use the body as a
682.16s: disguise through which to infiltrate
683.84s: human society in order to gather
685.76s: information about current events on
687.36s: Earth. The officer as an isby having
690.16s: greater power than the being inhabiting
692.56s: the body of the archduke simply pushed
695.12s: the being out and took control of the
697.44s: body. Whoa. Really treating them like
701.96s: puppets. However, this officer did not
704.88s: realize how much Hapsburg were hated by
708.24s: feuding factions in the country. So, he
710.80s: was caught off guard when the body of
712.40s: the archduke was assassinated by a
714.32s: Bosnian student. The officer or Isby was
717.60s: suddenly knocked out of the body when it
719.92s: was shot by the assassin. Disoriented,
722.24s: the Isby inadvertedly penetrated one of
725.28s: the amnesia force screens and was
729.24s: captured. Oh, okay. So, the Isby leaves
732.48s: the body of the arch duke, penetrates
734.96s: the force
736.20s: screen, gets
738.12s: captured by I'm guessing the the Empire.
741.68s: Eventually, the domain discovered that a
743.92s: wide area of space is monitored by an
746.40s: electronic force field which controls
748.96s: all of the isbes in the end of the
751.12s: galaxy in this end of the galaxy
753.04s: including Earth. The electronic force
754.96s: screen is designed to detect isbes and
757.28s: prevent them from leaving this
759.96s: area.
761.48s: Whoa. If an Isby attempts to penetrate
764.48s: the force screen, it captures them in a
767.92s: kind of electronic net. The result is
770.96s: that the captured Isby is subjected to a
773.76s: very severe brainwashing treatment which
776.88s: erases the memory of the Isby. This
780.00s: process uses a tremendous electrical
782.56s: shock just like Earth psychiatrists use
785.28s: electric shock therapy to erase the
787.36s: memory and personality of a patient and
790.00s: to make them more
795.32s: cooperative. Whoa, that's crazy.
798.72s: So like anyone who dies when their
801.04s: spirit goes, they're zapped if they go
803.92s: past this
805.24s: barrier and then their memories are once
807.60s: again erased and they have to go back.
810.56s: On Earth, this therapy use uses only a
813.60s: few hundred volts of electricity.
815.12s: However, the electrical voltage used by
817.28s: the old empire operation against
819.96s: Isby is in the on the order of magnitude
823.28s: of billions of volts. This tremendous
825.68s: shock completely wipes out all memory of
828.16s: the Isby. The memory eraser is not just
831.92s: for one life or one body. It wipes out
834.56s: all of the accumulated experiences of a
837.36s: nearly infinite past as well as the
840.32s: identity of the Isby. The shock is
843.28s: intended to make it impossible for the
845.12s: Isby to remember who they are, where
847.68s: they came from, their knowledge or
849.52s: skills, their memory of the past, and
852.32s: ability to function as a spiritual
854.36s: entity. They are overwhelmed into
856.72s: becoming a mindless robotic non-
860.68s: entity. Whoa. So, they're out here
863.20s: creating
864.68s: NPCs is what I'm gathering from this.
867.60s: But only if you sort of go out of line.
870.48s: only if you try to escape the matrix.
872.64s: Which is wild
874.44s: because if you have seen the recent
877.20s: interview featuring Matt Brown, a
879.08s: whistleblower, this interview was
880.88s: conducted by George Knapp and Jeremy
883.04s: Corbel on his show Weaponized. It was a
885.36s: three-part series, very fascinating, but
887.12s: this guy came across the documents now
889.84s: known, you know, now presented to
891.60s: Congress as Immaculate Constellation,
894.32s: which we've covered. If you want to see
896.56s: uh the entire readthrough of that
897.92s: document, very fascinating. go and check
900.08s: that out. But he does mention a few
903.20s: cryptic things. I think humanity to some
906.56s: level is a resource for them. Possibly a
910.20s: commodity,
912.20s: possibly form of entertainment,
915.56s: possibly medical
917.80s: related. We live in the
921.24s: matrix. You are not free.
925.12s: And this reality has far more to it than
928.32s: you have been allowed to believe.
931.68s: But that matrix comment really gels with
934.16s: what we're talking about here. It
937.64s: also really coaleses with, you know, the
941.20s: container
942.68s: idea. I don't like the sound of this.
945.04s: All right, let's keep reading. After the
948.00s: shock, a series of post-hypnotic
949.84s: suggestions are are used to install
952.00s: false memories and a false time
953.68s: orientation in each isby. This includes
956.48s: the command to return to the base after
959.12s: the body dies so that the same kind of
961.84s: shock and hypnosis can be done again and
964.44s: again again
966.36s: forever. The hypnotic command also tells
969.12s: the patient to forget to remember.
973.44s: What the domain learned from the
974.96s: experience of this officer is that the
976.88s: old empire has been using Earth as a
979.44s: prison planet for a very long time.
982.56s: Exactly how long is unknown, perhaps
984.80s: millions of
986.76s: years.
988.52s: Whoa. What's interesting about this
990.80s: theory, because I've heard this theory
992.08s: before, but it's almost like the sort of
995.04s: karmic circle that we're trying to
996.96s: escape, but we keep having to sort of
999.68s: relive something. Um, I've also
1003.08s: heard people remote viewers I think have
1006.48s: looked into this as well and have found
1008.32s: something some technology suppressing
1011.68s: the soul somehow. I don't even know,
1013.36s: right? It's very fringe stuff, but I've
1015.76s: heard like when you pass and you see the
1018.28s: light, that's actually like a whole
1020.88s: that's a ruse, right? That's like don't
1022.88s: go towards it cuz that's maybe what this
1026.04s: is.
1027.88s: Whoa. It's crazy to think about, dude.
1030.40s: That's so dark. You know, one thing I
1032.88s: always think about
1034.20s: is what is so
1037.08s: dark that when somebody finds out what
1040.72s: the secret of the phenomenon
1043.32s: is,
1045.08s: they refuse to share it with others.
1047.84s: What is that? How can it be so bad?
1051.12s: Because if it's
1052.28s: good, then there's no reason to keep it
1054.64s: secret, right? And I think Matt Brown
1056.00s: talks about that as well. There's no
1058.32s: reason to keep it secret if it's
1060.76s: good. So, okay, let's say it is
1064.44s: bad. It's got to be pretty
1067.32s: bad in order to keep it like that much
1070.64s: of a secret because I think pe the
1072.96s: public could handle aliens. Complete
1075.28s: speculation and they could be wrong, you
1077.36s: know, but I'm saying as a thought
1079.20s: experiment, what would that be? And I
1081.44s: think the scariest thing that I could
1083.52s: possibly imagine is when you're free of
1086.32s: the physical body and you go
1089.80s: beyond and you think, "Oh, this is, you
1092.80s: know, I leave the
1095.56s: matrix that that's still
1099.40s: them." I don't know if I like
1102.84s: that. Whoa. Yeah, that would be enough
1106.24s: for uh to drive people mad, but hey,
1108.96s: what are you gonna do?
1111.20s: If that is the case, I mean whatever,
1114.48s: you know, what do you want to do? So
1116.88s: when the body of an isby dies, they
1118.96s: depart from the body. They are detected
1120.64s: by the force screen. They are captured
1122.48s: and ordered by hypnotic command to
1124.32s: return to the light. Yep, there you go.
1127.68s: The idea of heaven and the afterlife are
1129.92s: part of the hypnotic suggestion, a part
1132.40s: of the treachery that makes the whole
1134.40s: mechanism work.
1136.92s: Whoa, crazy.
1139.92s: But also, if you give me heaven or
1142.92s: afterlife, be it real or fake. I mean,
1145.44s: if I don't know the difference, you
1146.96s: know, ignorance is bliss, but that would
1149.96s: suck. After the Isby has been shocked
1152.56s: and hypnotized to erase the memory of
1154.48s: the life they just lived, the Isby is
1156.80s: immediately commanded hypnotically to
1159.28s: report back to Earth as though they were
1161.68s: on a secret mission to inhabit a new
1163.68s: body. Each is told that they have a
1166.16s: special purpose for being on Earth. But
1168.48s: of course, there is no purpose for being
1170.16s: in a prison. At least not for the
1173.64s: prisoner. Whoa. I don't like this. I
1177.84s: don't I don't like if this is I don't
1179.92s: like this at all. If this is what's
1182.08s: going on, this is not cool. Don't do
1184.96s: that, old
1187.16s: empire. Quit it. Any undesirable isbes
1190.56s: who are sentenced to Earth were
1192.00s: classified as untouchable by the Old
1194.20s: Empire. This included anyone that the
1196.56s: Old Empire judged to be criminals who
1198.80s: are too vicious to be reformed or
1200.48s: subdued as well as other criminals such
1202.96s: as sexual perverts or beings unwilling
1205.44s: to do any productive
1207.88s: work. So a literal prison planet like
1210.72s: they're sending prisoners here. An
1212.56s: untouchable classification of isbes also
1215.36s: includes a wide variety of political
1217.36s: prisoners. This includes isbes who are
1219.52s: considered to be non-compliant
1221.28s: freethinkers or revolutionaries who make
1223.76s: trouble for the governments of the
1225.04s: various planets of the old empire. Of
1227.68s: course, anyone with a previous military
1230.00s: record against the old empire is also
1232.80s: shipped off to Earth. A list of
1235.88s: untouchables include artists, painters,
1238.56s: singers, musicians, writers, actors, and
1241.20s: performers of every kind. For this
1243.36s: reason, Earth has more artists per
1245.52s: capita than any other planet in the Old
1248.16s: Empire. Now, that's something I can get
1249.68s: behind, folks. Part of this is like nice
1252.80s: and neatly packaged, I will say, as
1255.12s: well, you know, for the reader, as in
1258.16s: we're like, "Yeah, but we can't all be
1259.76s: prisoners." And then like the next
1261.28s: sentence is like, "No, but there's also
1262.64s: really cool artists and really freeth
1264.24s: thinkers and like and we're like, "Yeah,
1265.60s: that's me." Everybody's like, "That's
1266.88s: me. That's me." You know? So it is I do
1270.12s: understand you know the fiction side of
1272.40s: it but again I will say for someone who
1275.52s: you know I think Lawrence R Spencer is a
1278.88s: fiction obviously a non-fiction or
1280.72s: science fiction writer but the depth of
1284.08s: lore here I mean it's really really deep
1288.16s: and I don't want to call you know
1290.24s: Lawrence an amateur writer because I
1291.68s: don't think he's an amateur writer but I
1293.28s: mean this is so deep it's easy to chalk
1296.80s: it up to oh this guy just made it up.
1298.80s: But kudos if you made it up because this
1301.68s: is a really
1303.48s: well-rounded hypothetical universe that
1306.64s: this person's created. And I think that
1309.12s: deserves merit in and of itself.
1311.12s: Untouchables also include intellectuals,
1313.24s: inventors, and geniuses in almost every
1315.84s: field. Since everything the old empire
1317.92s: considers valuable has long since been
1320.40s: invented or created over the last few
1322.32s: trillion years, they have no further use
1324.40s: for such beings. This includes skilled
1326.96s: managers also which are not needed in a
1329.52s: society of obedient robotic citizens.
1332.80s: We're trapped with all the Kairens here
1334.64s: folks. Anyone who is not willing or able
1337.12s: to submit to mindless economic,
1338.88s: political, and religious servitude as a
1341.12s: taxpaying worker in the class system of
1342.96s: the old empire are untouchable and
1345.28s: sentenced to receive memory wipeout and
1347.44s: permanent imprisonment on Earth.
1350.08s: The net result is that the Isby is
1351.92s: unable to escape because they can't
1353.68s: remember who they are, where they came
1355.36s: from, or where they are. They've been
1358.40s: hypnotized to think they're someone,
1360.08s: something, sometime, and somewhere other
1363.52s: than where they really are. The domain
1366.72s: officer, who is assassinated while in
1368.64s: the body of Archduke of Austria, was
1370.56s: likewise captured by the old empire
1373.00s: force. Because this particular officer
1376.00s: was a high-powered Isby compared to
1378.16s: most, he was taken away to a secret old
1380.32s: empire base under the surface of the
1382.32s: planet Mars. They put him into a special
1385.12s: electronic prison cell and held him
1387.32s: there. Fortunately, this domain officer
1390.16s: was able to escape from the underground
1391.92s: base after 27 years in captivity. When
1395.12s: he escaped from the old Empire base, he
1397.20s: returned immediately to his own base in
1399.52s: the asteroid belt. His commanding
1401.84s: officer ordered that a battle cruiser be
1403.96s: dispatched to the coordinates of the
1406.16s: base provided by his officer and to
1408.56s: destroy that base completely. This old
1410.64s: Empire base was located a few hundred
1412.88s: miles north of the equator on Mars in
1415.28s: the Sidonia
1418.28s: region. It is interesting just um right
1421.84s: here because this is all just notes.
1423.44s: This is all
1425.08s: apparently Matilda's translation of the
1427.92s: being's telepathic communications to
1430.60s: her. Pretty pretty intense and extensive
1433.96s: and like rather detailed, I would say,
1437.20s: like almost a little too detailed. You
1438.88s: know what I mean? This is turning slowly
1440.96s: into just like just a book and and less
1443.92s: of a
1445.96s: transcript. You feel me on that? Maybe
1448.24s: I'm just looking for a reason for this
1449.60s: not to be true at this point. You know,
1450.96s: I might I might be
1453.84s: But uh still fascinating man. Although
1455.84s: the military base of the old empire was
1457.60s: destroyed, unfortunately most of the
1459.12s: vast machinery of the ISB force screens,
1461.76s: the electroshock amnesia hypnosis
1464.16s: machinery continues to function in other
1466.40s: discovered locations right up to the
1468.40s: present moment. The main base or control
1470.64s: center for this mind control prison
1472.88s: operation has never been
1474.92s: found. So the influences of this base or
1478.24s: bases are still in effect.
1481.44s: The domain has observed that since the
1483.36s: old empire space forces were destroyed,
1485.92s: there is no one left to actively prevent
1488.32s: the planetary systems from bringing
1490.40s: their own untouchable isbes to Earth
1492.48s: from all over this galaxy and from other
1495.12s: galaxies nearby. Therefore, Earth has
1497.92s: become a universal dumping ground for
1500.56s: this entire region of space. Now, this
1503.36s: is ringing true. This is kind of hitting
1506.48s: home.
1507.84s: This in part explains the very unusual
1510.08s: mix of races, cultures, languages, moral
1512.56s: codes, religious and political
1514.56s: influences among the ISBY population on
1516.80s: Earth. The number and variety of
1518.88s: heterogeneous societies on Earth are
1521.20s: extremely unusual on a normal planet.
1524.00s: Most sun type 12 class 7 planets are
1527.36s: inhabited by only one humanoid body type
1529.92s: or race, if any.
1533.20s: In addition, most of the ancient
1535.28s: civilizations of Earth and many of the
1537.20s: events of Earth have been heavily
1538.64s: influenced by the hidden hypnotic
1540.72s: operation of the Old Empire base. So
1543.36s: far, no one has figured out exactly
1545.68s: where and how this operation is run or
1548.48s: by whom because it is so heavily
1550.72s: protected by screens and traps.
1555.96s: Furthermore, there's been no operation
1558.64s: undertaken to seek out, discover, and
1561.28s: destroy the vast and ancient networks of
1563.12s: electronics machinery that create the
1566.00s: ISB force screens at this end of the
1568.40s: galaxy. Until this has been done, we are
1571.52s: not able to prevent or interrupt the
1573.60s: electric shock operation, hypnosis, and
1576.32s: remote thought control of the old Empire
1578.96s: prison planet. Of course, all of the
1581.84s: crew members of the domain expeditionary
1583.76s: force now remain aware of this phenomena
1586.40s: at all times while operating in this
1588.56s: solar system space so as to prevent
1590.92s: detection and the capture by old empire
1595.64s: traps. Huh? I don't know how y'all are
1598.56s: feeling about this, but I'm feeling a
1600.12s: little I don't like it. You know what I
1602.52s: mean? But at the same time, it feels
1606.24s: like there is hope in this universe,
1608.32s: right? Perhaps this uh secret war going
1612.00s: on between governments or ungovernmented
1615.80s: factions of special forces. Perhaps
1619.44s: what's happening right now is is they're
1621.68s: trying to get a hold of this base and
1623.52s: destroy it. You know, that would be a
1625.76s: cool thing. I would love for that to be
1628.16s: the secret. You know, this whole time
1630.80s: we're thinking, "No, the US government
1633.12s: is completely nefarious and they are
1634.96s: hiding things from us for our
1636.64s: detriment." when in reality they're
1638.96s: actually fighting this secret war trying
1641.44s: to free our souls. That would be such a
1645.04s: cool plot for a movie. Oh my
1647.56s: god. We
1649.24s: proceed to the chunkier half of this
1652.64s: read through. Chapter 8, a lesson in
1656.56s: recent
1657.80s: history. Matilda's personal note and the
1660.40s: only little note that exists. This
1662.88s: interview taught me a history lesson I
1665.36s: will never read in any textbook written
1667.92s: on Earth. The domain has a much
1669.92s: different view of events than we do.
1671.68s: I've been reading a few prison planet
1673.28s: comments before this video and expected
1675.12s: to see it in this read through, but uh
1677.76s: even knowing what I was getting into is
1680.16s: still kind of upsetting. The domain
1682.48s: expeditionary force has observed a
1684.56s: resurgence in science and culture of the
1686.96s: western world since 1150 AD when the
1689.76s: remaining remnants of the space fleet of
1691.52s: the old empire in this solar system were
1694.92s: destroyed. The influence of the remote
1697.28s: control hypnosis operation diminished
1699.60s: slightly after that time but still
1701.44s: remains largely in force.
1704.96s: Apparently, a small amount of damage was
1706.72s: done to the Old Empire remote mind
1708.64s: control operation which resulted in a
1710.72s: small decrease in the power of this
1712.84s: mechanism. As a result, some memory of
1715.68s: technologies that is bees already knew
1718.40s: before they came to Earth started to be
1720.92s: remembered. Thereafter, the oppression
1723.28s: of knowledge that is called the dark
1725.36s: ages in Europe began to diminish after
1728.00s: that time. Whoa. So they're saying the
1730.16s: dark ages was a direct result of this
1735.36s: hypnotic sort of suppression tool that
1738.64s: the old empire had implemented. You know
1741.04s: the one thing I find interesting is that
1743.52s: they say they said prior that the
1746.92s: memories the shock was so strong that it
1749.68s: would completely erase and obliterate
1751.76s: people's memory of their almost infinite
1754.80s: existence. And now we take down a few of
1757.28s: these things and suddenly oh memories
1760.00s: coming back. Is it is it this this
1761.84s: suppression system that's keeping the
1763.60s: memories from coming back or is it this
1766.16s: electronic shock that's completely
1767.84s: erasing them? Or is it a mix of both? I
1769.44s: don't know. Since then, the knowledge of
1771.04s: the basic laws of physics and
1772.64s: electricity have revolutionized Earth
1774.72s: culture virtually overnight. The ability
1777.28s: to remember technology by many of the
1779.20s: geniuses in the Isby population of Earth
1781.60s: was partially restored when not so
1783.60s: actively suppressed as it was before
1785.48s: 1150. Sir Isaac Newton is one of the
1788.08s: best examples of this. In only a few
1790.00s: decades, he single-handedly reinvented
1792.72s: several major and fundamental scientific
1795.36s: and mathematical disciplines. I mean,
1798.00s: Nicola Tesla would be a great example of
1800.24s: that. I think, you know, this guy was
1802.92s: just literally getting information from
1805.92s: somewhere else. Maybe he was just an
1809.04s: officer Isby, you know, doing his job.
1811.36s: An officer of the domain, I should say.
1813.28s: The men who remembered these sciences
1815.20s: already knew them before they were sent
1816.72s: to Earth. Ordinarily, no one would ever
1819.20s: observe or discover as much about
1821.04s: science and mathematics in a single
1822.72s: lifetime, or even in a few hundred
1824.96s: lifetimes. These subjects have taken
1827.44s: civilizations billions and billions of
1829.52s: years to
1831.08s: create. Isbes on Earth have only just
1833.68s: begun to remember small fragments of all
1836.08s: the technologies that exist throughout
1837.92s: the universe. Theoretically, if the
1840.40s: amnesia mechanisms being used against
1842.48s: Earth could be broken entirely, isbes
1844.96s: would regain all of their
1847.00s: memory. See, that seems to be such like
1849.68s: a happy ending like type deal. It's
1851.92s: like, what is it, man? Are you erasing
1853.60s: all of her memory or is it this thing
1855.76s: suppressing them and destroying them
1857.92s: would free us all? This it sounds too
1860.80s: much like a Hollywood plot at this
1862.56s: point. I'm not trying to be a hater but
1864.92s: again I don't quite like the idea of
1867.60s: this. So that's why I'm all right just I
1869.52s: like the idea of this old empire. Okay.
1872.04s: Unfortunately similar advances have not
1874.32s: been seen in the humanities as the isbes
1876.72s: of earth continue to behave very badly
1878.80s: towards each other. This behavior,
1880.84s: however, is heavily influenced by the
1883.52s: hypnotic commands given to each isby
1885.60s: between lifetimes. And the very unusual
1887.60s: combination of inmates on Earth,
1889.68s: criminals, perverts, artists,
1891.92s: revolutionaries, and geniuses, is the
1894.40s: cause of a very restive and tumultuous
1897.04s: environment. The purpose of the prison
1899.04s: planet is to keep Isbes on Earth
1900.96s: forever. Promoting ignorance,
1903.28s: superstition, and war between isbes
1906.32s: helps to keep the prison population
1908.16s: crippled and trapped behind the wall of
1910.64s: electronic force
1912.20s: screens. Isbes have been dumped on Earth
1915.04s: from all over the galaxy, adjoining
1916.96s: galaxies, and from planetary systems all
1919.52s: over the old empire like Sirius,
1922.04s: Alderbron, the Plleades, Orion,
1924.72s: Draconus, and countless others.
1927.28s: There are Isbes on Earth from unnamed
1929.76s: races, civilizations, cultural
1932.08s: backgrounds, and planetary environments.
1934.88s: Each of the various ISBY populations
1936.88s: have their own languages, belief
1938.48s: systems, moral values, religious
1941.08s: beliefs, training, and unknown and
1943.44s: untold histories. These isbes are mixed
1946.56s: together with earlier inhabitants of
1948.64s: Earth who came from another star system
1950.48s: more than 400,000 years ago to establish
1953.36s: the civilizations of Atlanta and
1956.28s: Laamria. Those civilizations vanished
1958.56s: beneath the tidal waves caused by the
1960.24s: planetary polar shift many thousands of
1963.20s: years before the current prison
1964.80s: population started to arrive.
1967.84s: Apparently the isbes from those star
1969.68s: systems were the source of the original
1971.76s: oriental races of Earth beginning in
1973.64s: Australia. Okay. So if we recall Lerta,
1977.68s: she said that
1979.76s: uh this title event that happened was
1982.48s: younger dice. What was that like 12,000
1984.08s: to 15,000 years ago? What Lerta said
1987.36s: that that was actually the result of a
1991.12s: fight between two races, right? the
1996.04s: Elohim and the the other humanoid
2001.16s: beings or the humanoid and the reptilian
2004.00s: beings. Anyways, there was a war and
2006.80s: they kind of wiped everything out and
2008.80s: those waves weren't caused by a meteor
2010.64s: or anything. They were caused, you know,
2012.56s: by bombs essentially.
2015.76s: On the other hand, the civilizations set
2017.76s: up on Earth by the Old Empire prison
2019.76s: system were very different from the
2021.04s: civilization of the Old Empire itself,
2023.44s: which is an electronic space opera,
2025.52s: atomicpowered conglomeration of earlier
2028.28s: civilizations that were conquered with
2030.40s: nuclear weapons and colonized by Isbes
2032.80s: from another galaxy. The bureaucracy
2035.76s: that controlled the former Old Empire
2037.92s: was from an ancient space opera society
2040.32s: run by a totalitarian confederation of
2043.92s: planetary
2045.16s: governments regulated by a brutal
2047.92s: social, economic, and political
2049.68s: hierarchy with a royal monarch as its
2053.96s: figurehead. This sounds reptilian. This
2056.72s: type of government emerges with
2058.24s: regularity on planets where the citizens
2060.48s: abandon personal responsibility for
2062.56s: autonomous self-regulation. They
2064.72s: frequently lose their freedom to
2066.24s: demented Isbes who suffer from an
2068.40s: overwhelming paranoia that every other
2070.72s: Isby is their enemy who must be
2072.64s: controlled or destroyed. Their closest
2075.12s: friends and allies whom they espouse to
2077.92s: love and cherish are literally loved to
2080.72s: death by
2082.44s: them. This is interesting. the uh this
2085.68s: type of government. It says this type of
2087.28s: government government emerges with
2089.04s: regularity on planets where citizens
2090.88s: abandon personal responsibility for
2093.44s: autonomous
2096.44s: self-regulation. Sounds a lot like AI.
2099.60s: It does sound like AI. Like what if AI
2102.80s: happened and then these guys come along
2104.72s: cuz they're like, "Oh, you guys are just
2106.56s: going to give up. You're going to give
2107.84s: your souls to AI. We'll just take it
2109.52s: from here." Because such isbes exist,
2112.32s: the domain has learned that freedom must
2114.64s: be won and maintained through eternal
2116.48s: vigilance and the ability to use
2118.16s: defensive force to maintain it. As a
2120.56s: result, the domain has already conquered
2122.88s: the governing planet of the old empire.
2125.84s: Civilization of the domain, although
2127.76s: considerably younger and smaller in
2129.60s: size, is already more powerful, better
2131.84s: organized, and united by egalitarian
2135.48s: espred spirit of body never known in the
2139.12s: history of the old empire. So
2140.96s: togetherness defeats, you know, this
2143.44s: wararmongering mentality. The recently
2145.36s: desoiled German totalitarian state on
2147.68s: Earth was similar to the old empire, but
2149.76s: not nearly as brutal. Wo, really? and
2153.52s: about 10,000 times less powerful. Many
2155.76s: of the Isbes on Earth are here because
2158.00s: they are violently opposed to
2159.56s: totalitarian government or because they
2162.64s: were so psychotically vicious that they
2165.36s: could not be controlled by old empire
2168.24s: government. Whoa. So that would make
2171.88s: for a planet filled with turmoil and and
2175.44s: and conflict, right? If you send people
2177.92s: here who are literally against
2180.20s: totalitarian rule, but also people who
2184.72s: are psychotic and power- hungry, right?
2188.16s: That would
2189.24s: create consistent constant
2192.84s: conflict, which would essentially
2195.92s: perpetuate and propel this idea of a
2200.16s: prison planet. We'd just be fighting
2202.00s: each other blind to the fact that
2203.44s: there's a greater fight to be fought.
2205.84s: It's a good
2207.00s: plan. It's a good plan. Consequently,
2210.56s: the population of Earth is
2211.88s: disproportionately comprised of a very
2214.32s: high percentage of such beings. The
2216.56s: conflicting cultural and ethical moral
2218.40s: codes of the isbes on Earth is unusual
2220.88s: in the extreme. The domain conquest of
2223.76s: the central old empire planets was
2225.76s: fought with electronic cannon. The
2227.92s: citizens of the old planets forming the
2230.40s: core of government for the old empire
2232.48s: are filthy, degraded, slave society of
2236.24s: mindless taxpaying workers who practice
2239.56s: cannibalism. Violent automotive
2241.84s: racetracks and bloody Roman circus type
2245.24s: entertainments are their only
2249.16s: amusements. Whoa. Regardless of any
2251.84s: reasonable justification we may have had
2254.08s: for using atomic weapons to vanquish the
2256.32s: planets of the old empire, the domain is
2258.64s: careful not to ruin the resources of
2260.72s: those planets by using weapons of crude
2263.20s: radioactive
2265.08s: force. The current US civilization is
2268.16s: beginning to mimic some of the trappings
2270.08s: of that civilization, especially in the
2272.40s: design of airplanes, automobiles, ships,
2275.20s: trains, and telephones. Likewise,
2277.76s: buildings in the cities of Earth are
2279.36s: thought to be modern or futuristic if
2282.24s: their design resembles the architecture
2284.64s: of the Old
2287.00s: Empire. The government of the Old Empire
2289.44s: before being supplanted by the domain
2291.44s: was comprised of beings who possessed a
2293.44s: very craven intelligence, very much like
2295.60s: the Axis powers during your recent world
2298.24s: war. Those beings manifested precisely
2301.12s: the same behavior as the galactic
2302.96s: government that exiled them to eternal
2305.36s: imprisonment on Earth. They were a
2307.60s: gruesome reminder of the ageless maxim
2310.08s: that a Nisby will often manifest the
2312.32s: treatment they have received from
2313.96s: others. Kindness fosters kindness.
2317.56s: Cruelty begets cruelty. One must be able
2321.28s: and willing to use force tempered with
2323.60s: intelligence to prevent harm to the
2325.92s: innocent.
2327.08s: However, extraordinary understanding,
2329.80s: self-discipline, and courage are
2332.16s: required to effectively prevent
2333.76s: brutality without being overwhelmed by
2336.00s: the malice that motivated the brutality.
2339.68s: Only a demonic self-serving government
2341.68s: would employ a logic or science to
2344.32s: conceive that an ultimate solution to
2346.72s: any problem is to murder and permanently
2349.28s: erase the memory of every artist,
2351.12s: genius, skilled manager, and inventor
2353.92s: and cast them into a planetary prison
2356.32s: together with political opponents,
2358.00s: killers, thieves, perverts, and disabled
2360.56s: beings of an entire galaxy. We out here,
2364.16s: folks.
2366.24s: I mean, we out here, dude. It ain't
2370.28s: easy, you know, being
2373.08s: a Sun type 12 class 7 civilization. You
2377.16s: know, once the isbes expelled from the
2380.56s: old empire arrived on Earth, they were
2382.80s: given amnesia and hypnotically tricked
2384.64s: into thinking that something else had
2386.00s: happened to them. The next step was to
2387.84s: implant the Isbes into biological bodies
2390.08s: on Earth. The bodies became the human
2392.48s: populations of false civilizations which
2394.72s: were designed and installed in the minds
2396.48s: of isbes to look completely unlike the
2398.64s: old empire. All of the isbes of India,
2401.36s: Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, and
2403.68s: medieval Europe were guided to pattern
2405.92s: and build the cultural elements of these
2408.48s: societies based on standard patterns
2410.64s: developed by the isbes of many earlier
2413.44s: similar civilizations on Sunype 12 class
2416.72s: 7 planets that have existed for
2418.96s: trillions of years throughout the
2421.80s: universe. In the earliest times, Isbes
2425.76s: sent to prison Earth lived in India.
2428.80s: They gradually spread into Mesopotamia,
2431.68s: Egypt, Meso America, Archa, Greece,
2434.64s: Rome, medieval Europe, and to the new
2438.44s: world. They were hypnotically commanded
2441.04s: to follow the pattern of a given
2442.80s: civilization by the old empire prison
2444.92s: operators. This is an effective
2446.88s: mechanism to disguise the actual time
2448.96s: and location from the Isbes imprisoned
2451.28s: on Earth. The language, costumes, and
2454.24s: culture of each false civilization are
2456.08s: intended to reinforce amnesia because
2458.40s: they do not remind the isbes on Earth of
2460.72s: the original old empire planets from
2462.88s: which they were
2464.84s: deported. On the very far back track of
2467.92s: time, these types of civilizations
2470.08s: tended to repeat themselves over and
2471.92s: over because the isbes who created them
2474.48s: become familiar with certain patterns
2476.88s: and styles and stayed with them.
2479.68s: It is a lot of work to invent an entire
2481.84s: civilization complete with culture and
2483.76s: architecture, language, customs,
2485.52s: mathematics, moral values, and so forth.
2488.00s: It is much easier to replicate a copy
2490.48s: based on a familiar and successful
2495.24s: pattern. A sun type 12 class 7 planet is
2499.04s: the designation given to a planet
2500.88s: inhabited by carbon oxygen-based life
2504.08s: forms. The class of the planet is based
2507.20s: on the size and radiation intensity of
2509.44s: the star, the distance of the planetary
2511.60s: orbit from the star and the size,
2513.84s: density, gravity or chemical composition
2516.00s: of the planet. Likewise, flora and fauna
2518.96s: are designated and identified according
2521.20s: to the star type and class of planet
2524.40s: they
2526.60s: inhabit. Got that? So, what are the
2529.68s: other ones? Do we get
2531.08s: to we get to find out what our brother
2534.24s: and sister planets
2536.12s: are? On the average, the percentage of
2538.72s: planets in the physical universe with a
2540.96s: breathable atmosphere is relatively
2543.20s: small. Most planets do not have an
2545.92s: atmosphere upon which life forms feed as
2549.20s: on earth where the chemical compositions
2552.08s: of the atmosphere provides nutrition to
2554.96s: plants and other
2556.52s: organisms which in turn support other
2559.20s: life forms. When the domain force
2561.44s: brought the vetic hymns to the Himalaya
2564.48s: regions about 8,200 years ago, some
2567.60s: human societies already existed. The
2569.76s: Aryan people invaded and conquered India
2572.72s: bringing the Vic hymns to the area. Can
2575.68s: I just I'm I'm a little ignorant to
2577.36s: this. I don't know everything folks.
2579.84s: That's part of this journey is that we
2581.12s: get to figure it out. I'm sure there's
2582.96s: some of you out there that are also a
2584.16s: little lost here. What are the Vic
2586.00s: hymns? The Vadic hymns are a collection
2588.48s: of ancient religious texts that form the
2590.88s: core of the vadas, the oldest scriptures
2593.52s: of Hinduism composed in Sanskrit between
2596.72s: approximately 1500 and 500 B.CE. These
2600.56s: hymns are primarily found in the
2602.32s: Rigveda, the oldest of the four
2604.76s: vadas. They consist of praises, prayers
2607.68s: and mantras dedicated to various deities
2610.08s: like Agni, the fire god, Indra, the king
2612.80s: of gods and s a ritual drink. These
2616.32s: hymns are recited during rituals and
2618.32s: ceremonies and are considered to have
2620.24s: spiritual and philosophical
2622.04s: significance. They also cover a wide
2624.48s: range of topics including cosmology,
2627.20s: ethics and the nature of so the the
2630.32s: domain force brought the vdic hymns. I
2633.52s: mean that would make sense right? If
2635.60s: there is some like deeper knowledge out
2637.44s: there that exists that that would have
2640.08s: been brought to us by a more intelligent
2642.40s: species. So the vadas were learned by
2644.80s: them memorized and carried forward
2646.48s: verbally for 7,000 years before being
2648.72s: committed to written form. During that
2651.12s: span of time, one of the officers of the
2653.28s: domain expeditionary force was
2655.04s: incarnated on earth as Vishnu. He is
2658.32s: described many times in the Rigveda. He
2661.28s: is still considered to be a god by the
2663.52s: Hindus. Vishnu fought in the religious
2666.16s: wars against the old empire forces. He
2669.12s: is a very able and aggressive isby as
2672.16s: well as a highly effective officer who
2674.96s: has since been reassigned to other
2676.80s: duties in the domain. How
2679.08s: cool. That's such cool. That's such a
2681.60s: cool lore. This is so cool. If this is
2686.76s: reality reality is like the best science
2689.68s: fiction novel of all, right? If this was
2692.00s: true, that would be just the best. Now
2694.56s: you're thinking, which is it, Chris? Do
2696.08s: you like this? Do you not like this? I
2697.92s: don't know. I like the idea of this like
2701.20s: soul battle going on. Like the the
2703.28s: science fiction nerd in me is like
2705.04s: thriving right now. But, you know, the
2708.00s: human which uh which is which which is
2710.64s: on the outside of this isby is is kind
2713.12s: of scared. But, you know, either way, I
2716.80s: think incredibly entertaining uh to say
2719.36s: the least. This entire episode was
2721.80s: orchestrated as an attack and revolt
2724.40s: against the Egyptian pantheon installed
2726.56s: by old empire
2727.96s: administrators. The conflict was
2730.00s: intended to help free humankind from
2732.08s: implanted elements of the false
2733.76s: civilization that focused attention on
2736.16s: many gods as superstitious ritual
2738.80s: warships demanded by the priests who
2740.72s: managed them. It is all part of the
2743.60s: mental manipulation by the old empire to
2745.92s: hide their criminal actions against the
2747.52s: isbes on Earth. Whoa. Okay. So the
2750.16s: ancient Egyptians were the
2753.00s: empire and then the ancient Hindu
2757.72s: was you know the uh the domain isbes. A
2761.84s: priesthood or prison guards were used to
2764.08s: help reinforce the idea that an
2765.68s: individual is only a biological body and
2768.80s: is not an immortal spiritual being. The
2771.44s: individual has no identity. The
2773.20s: individuals have no past lives. The
2776.00s: individual has no power. Only the gods
2778.72s: have power and the gods are a
2781.12s: contrivance of the priests who intercede
2783.84s: between men and the gods they serve. Men
2788.00s: are slaves to the dictates of the
2790.00s: priests who threaten eternal spiritual
2791.92s: punishment if men do not obey them. What
2795.12s: else would one expect on a prison planet
2796.96s: where all prisoners have have amnesia
2799.20s: and the priests themselves are
2800.72s: prisoners? The intervention of the
2802.96s: domain force on Earth has not been
2805.28s: entirely successful due to the secret
2808.00s: mind control operation of the old empire
2810.40s: that still continues to
2812.36s: operate. A battle was waged between old
2815.12s: empire forces and the domain through
2816.96s: religious conquest between 1500 BC and
2820.48s: about 1200 BC. The domain forces
2822.56s: attempted to teach the concept of an
2824.64s: individual immortal spiritual being to
2827.04s: several influential beings on Earth.
2831.12s: One such instance resulted in a very
2833.44s: tragic misunderstanding,
2835.00s: misinterpretation and misapplication of
2837.28s: the concept. The idea was perverted and
2839.92s: applied to mean that there is only one
2842.76s: Isby instead of the truth that everyone
2845.36s: is an Isby. Obviously, this was a gross
2848.12s: incomprehension, an utter unwillingness
2850.32s: to take responsibility for one's own
2852.76s: power. Is he talking about
2856.12s: Jesus? What's going on here? The Old
2858.96s: Empire priests managed to corrupt the
2860.72s: concept of individual immortality into
2863.04s: the idea that there is only one all
2864.96s: powerful Isby and that no one else is or
2868.32s: is allowed to be an iss. Obviously, this
2870.72s: is the work of the Old Empire amnesia
2873.32s: operation. It is easy to teach this
2875.68s: altered notion to beings who do not want
2877.76s: to be responsible for their own lives.
2879.92s: Slaves are such
2881.80s: beings. As long as one chooses to assign
2884.64s: responsibility for creation, existence,
2886.80s: and personal accountability for one's
2888.48s: own thoughts and actions to others, one
2891.12s: is a slave.
2894.40s: As a result, the concept of a single
2896.64s: monotheistic god resulted and was
2899.52s: promoted by many self-proclaimed
2902.76s: prophets such as the Jewish slave leader
2905.96s: Moses who grew up in the household of
2908.40s: the pharaoh Amenoteep III and his son
2912.92s: Aenetan and his wife Nefertiti as well
2915.92s: as his son Tutankan.
2918.80s: The attempt to teach certain beings on
2920.88s: Earth the truth that they are themselves
2923.64s: isbees was part of a plan to overthrow
2926.16s: the fictional metaphorical
2927.80s: anthropomorphic paniply of gods created
2930.80s: by the old empire mystery cult called
2933.12s: the brothers of the
2934.76s: serpent known in Egypt as the priests of
2938.36s: Ammoon. They are very ancient secret
2941.04s: society within the old empire. Hold on.
2943.36s: Brothers of the
2944.68s: serpents. Is the old empire
2949.88s: reptilian? But didn't the reptilians say
2952.40s: that these other guys were evil? Got
2955.04s: some alien propaganda going on here. The
2957.36s: pharaoh Kennington was not a very
2958.80s: intelligent being and was heavily
2960.88s: influenced by his personal ambition for
2962.64s: self- glorification. He altered the
2964.64s: concept of the individual spiritual
2966.24s: being and embodied the concept in the
2968.16s: sun god a 10en. His pitiful existence
2971.20s: was soon ended. He was assassinated by
2973.84s: Maya and
2975.96s: Perennifer, two of the priests of Ammun
2978.88s: or Amen, which the Christians still say
2982.48s: who represented the interests of the old
2984.24s: empire forces. The idea of one God was
2987.60s: perpetuated by the Hebrew leader Moses
2989.92s: while he was in Egypt. He left Egypt
2992.56s: with his adopted people, the Jewish
2994.76s: slaves. While they were crossing the
2996.80s: desert, Moses was intercepted by an
2998.64s: operative of the Old Empire near Mount
3000.80s: Si. Moses was tricked into believing
3003.12s: that this operative was the one god
3006.48s: through the use of hypnotic commands as
3009.12s: well as technical and aesthetic tricks
3010.88s: which are commonly used by the old
3012.56s: empire to trap isbes. Thereafter, the
3015.36s: Jewish slaves who trusted the word of
3017.44s: Moses implicitly have worshiped a single
3019.68s: god they call Yahweh.
3022.56s: The name Yahweh means anonymous. As the
3025.52s: Isby who worked with Moses could not use
3028.40s: an actual name or anything that would
3030.40s: identify himself or blow the cover of
3032.08s: the amnesia/prison operation. The last
3034.88s: thing the covert amnesia hypnosis prison
3037.12s: system wanted to do is to reveal
3038.80s: themselves openly to the Isbes on Earth.
3041.84s: They feel that this would restore the
3043.52s: inmates
3045.16s: memories. This is kind of crazy. This is
3047.76s: kind of nuts right now. We're we're
3049.36s: we're we're in we're in pretty nutty
3051.52s: territory. All right. Now, you're I'm
3053.76s: not saying you lost me, but these are
3056.40s: really interesting details that I think
3059.16s: uh I guess are important for the I don't
3062.08s: know. This is the reason that all traces
3064.08s: of physical encounters between
3065.68s: operatives of space civilizations and
3067.92s: humans is very carefully hidden,
3069.36s: disguised, covered up, and denied or
3071.60s: misdirected.
3074.08s: This Old Empire operative contacted
3076.40s: Moses on a desert mountaintop and
3078.40s: delivered the 10 hypnotic commands to
3080.96s: him. These commands are very forcefully
3083.36s: worded and compel an Isby into utter
3086.20s: subservience to the will of the
3088.24s: operator. These hypnotic commands are
3090.24s: still in the effect and influence the
3092.88s: thought patterns of millions of iss
3094.96s: thousands of years later.
3097.52s: Incidentally, we later discovered that
3099.76s: the so-called Yahweh also wrote,
3102.08s: programmed, and encoded the text of the
3104.24s: Torah, which when it is read literally
3106.96s: or in its decoded form, will provide a
3109.68s: great deal more false information to
3111.52s: those who read it. Ultimately, the
3113.60s: Vicims became the source of nearly all
3115.68s: of the Eastern religions and were the
3117.84s: philosophical source of the ideas common
3120.40s: to Buddha, Zoroaster, and other
3123.44s: philosophers. The civilizing influences
3126.16s: of these philosophies eventually replace
3128.24s: the brutal idolatry of the old empire
3131.56s: religions and were the true genesis of
3134.08s: kindness and
3135.40s: compassion. You asked me earlier why the
3137.92s: domain and other space civilizations do
3140.16s: not land on Earth or make their presence
3142.44s: known land on Earth. Do you think we are
3145.88s: crazy or want to be crazy? It takes a
3149.28s: very brave Isby to come down through the
3151.36s: atmosphere and land on Earth because
3153.36s: this is a prison planet with a very
3155.52s: uncontrolled psychotic population. And
3158.64s: no Isby is entirely proof against the
3162.48s: risk of
3163.40s: entrapment. As with the members of the
3165.60s: domain expeditionary force who were
3167.36s: captured in the Himalayas 8,200 years
3170.36s: ago. I like how all of a sudden Arrol is
3173.96s: like, "You think I'm nuts, bro? Coming
3177.92s: to
3179.48s: Earth. Coming to this crazy
3182.28s: place. Yeah, Arrol can't hang with us,
3185.20s: man. We're too uncontrollable and
3187.60s: psychotic. No one knows what is bebs on
3189.76s: Earth are going to do. We are not
3191.76s: scheduled to invest the resources of the
3193.52s: domain to take total control of all the
3195.28s: space surrounding the area at this time.
3198.16s: This will occur in the not too distant
3200.24s: future, about 5,000 Earth years,
3202.24s: according to the time schedule of the
3204.84s: domain. At this time, uh, we do not
3208.16s: prevent transports from other planetary
3210.08s: systems or galaxies from continuing to
3212.24s: drop isbes into the Amnesia forcreen
3214.72s: area. Eventually, this will change. I
3217.44s: love how this just became like a
3220.12s: clerical bureaucracy related problem for
3224.20s: us. We're like, "Please free our souls
3228.08s: from this eternal prison planet." And
3230.24s: they're like, "Yeah, we'll get to it. Uh
3232.40s: yeah, we got you scheduled down for
3234.48s: 5,000 years. So, not too long
3236.80s: considering, you know, the 80 trillion
3238.96s: years of existence. Um should only be
3241.68s: another 5,000 years. So, hang in there
3244.96s: and uh we'll get back to you as soon as
3247.12s: we loop back around. All right, I'm
3248.88s: going to I'm going to circle back around
3251.04s: to this problem in 5,000
3253.32s: years. Warm regards the domain. In
3256.80s: addition, Earth inherently is a highly
3259.36s: unstable planet. It is not suitable for
3261.84s: settlement or permanent habitation for
3263.84s: any sustainable civilization. This is
3266.24s: part of the reason why it is being used
3267.92s: as a prison planet. No one else would
3269.76s: seriously consider living here for a
3272.08s: variety of simple and compelling
3273.84s: reasons. Well, let's hear them out
3276.72s: because I I tend to disagree. I think
3279.20s: the fjords are beautiful. Just some
3281.60s: amazing places on this earth that would
3283.44s: that would compel lots of people to want
3285.84s: to colonize us. Number one, the
3288.88s: continental land masses of Earth are
3290.80s: floating on a sea of molten lava beneath
3292.96s: the surface, which causes the land
3294.88s: masses to crack, crumble, and drift
3297.44s: continually. Okay, not a bad note. All
3299.92s: right, I'll give you one point. Number
3302.60s: two, because of the liquid nature of the
3305.20s: core, the planet is largely volcanic and
3307.52s: subject to earthquakes and volcanic
3309.40s: explosions. All
3311.72s: right. Okay. Number three, the magnetic
3315.44s: poles of the planet shift radically
3318.00s: about once every 20,000 years. This
3320.16s: causes a greater or lesser degree of
3322.00s: devastation as a result of the tidal
3323.68s: waves and climatic change
3328.04s: changes.
3331.48s: Okay. All right. Three for three. Uh
3334.48s: number four, Earth is a very distant is
3337.28s: very distant from the center of the
3338.48s: galaxy and from any other significant
3340.80s: galactic civilization. This isolation
3343.36s: makes it unsuitable for use except as a
3346.00s: pit stop or jumping off point along the
3348.40s: way between galaxies. The moon and
3350.96s: asteroids are far more suitable for this
3353.04s: purpose because they do not have any
3355.28s: significant gravity. Okay. Well, I don't
3358.08s: know about that, so you know, I can't
3359.92s: agree with it. Number five, Earth is a
3363.12s: heavy gravity planet with heavy metallic
3365.84s: soil and a dense atmosphere. This makes
3368.32s: it treacherous for navigational
3369.92s: purposes. That fact that I am in this
3373.20s: room as the result of an in-flight
3376.08s: accident in spite of the technology of
3378.24s: my craft and my extensive expertise as a
3380.64s: pilot are proof of these facts. That's
3384.32s: hilarious. That is pretty funny that
3387.84s: this, you know, salty little being is
3390.16s: like, "Your planet
3393.00s: sucks." And um the only reason I'm here
3396.56s: is because it is unnavigable. It is
3399.04s: dense. It is
3401.40s: gravitationally anomalous and we don't
3403.52s: like it. We don't like coming here. We
3405.44s: don't want to be here. This is a
3406.88s: disgusting prison planet. I don't know.
3409.36s: Our pilots seem to do just
3411.80s: fine. Maybe you could take a note,
3414.36s: Errol, on how to properly fly one of
3417.04s: these things. Number six, there are
3419.68s: approximately 60 billion Earthlike sun
3423.12s: type 12 class 7 planets in the Milky Way
3425.76s: galaxy alone. Not to mention the vast
3428.80s: expanse of the domain and the
3430.32s: territories we will claim in the future.
3432.64s: It is difficult to stretch our resources
3434.48s: to do so much more than a periodic
3436.72s: reconnaissance of Earth. Especially when
3439.12s: there are no immediate advantages to
3440.88s: invest resources here. Makes sense. I
3444.24s: I'll Yeah, I see you there. Not worth
3447.60s: stopping
3448.44s: by. Got it.
3451.20s: On Earth, most beings are not aware that
3453.44s: they are isbes or that they there are
3456.64s: spirits of any kind. Many other beings
3459.36s: are aware of this, but nearly everyone
3462.08s: has a very limited understanding of
3464.32s: themselves as an Isby. One of the
3466.40s: reasons for this is that isbes have been
3468.16s: waging war against each other since the
3470.16s: beginning of time. The purpose of these
3472.48s: wars have always been to establish
3474.08s: domination by one is or group of isbes
3476.96s: over another. Since an ISBY cannot be
3479.76s: killed, the objective has been to
3481.92s: capture and immobilize isbes. This has
3485.20s: been done in a nearly unlimited variety
3487.52s: of ways. The most basic method to
3489.60s: capture and immobilize an
3499.96s: issued the old empire beginning about 64
3504.16s: trillion years ago. Traps are often set
3506.80s: up in the territory of the issbes being
3509.12s: attacked. Usually a trap is set within
3511.28s: the electronic wave of beauty to attract
3514.16s: the interest and attention of the iss.
3516.40s: And when the iss moves towards the
3518.32s: source of the aesthetic wave, such a
3520.64s: beautiful building or beautiful music,
3523.12s: the trap is activated by the energy put
3525.36s: out by the Isby. One of the most common
3527.68s: trap mechanisms uses the Isisby's own
3530.32s: thought energy output when the Isby
3532.56s: tries to attack or fight against the
3534.48s: trap.
3535.60s: fight back against the trap. The trap is
3538.00s: activated and energized by the Isby's
3540.24s: own thought energy. The harder the Isby
3542.40s: fights against the trap, the more it
3544.48s: pulls the
3547.24s: IBS toward it and keeps them stuck in
3550.48s: the trap or the Isby. He probably meant
3552.72s: to spell Isby there. Throughout the
3554.48s: entire history of this physical
3556.56s: universe, vast areas of space have been
3558.88s: taken over and colonized by Isby
3561.12s: societies who invade and take over new
3563.52s: areas of space. in this
3565.72s: fashion. In the past, these invasions
3568.24s: have always shared common elements. All
3570.32s: right, let's see what they are. Number
3572.44s: one, the overwhelming use of force of
3575.20s: arms, usually with nuclear electronic
3577.20s: weapons. Number two, mind control of the
3580.48s: Isbes in the invaded area through the
3582.56s: use of electroshock, drugs, hypnosis,
3584.96s: eraser of memory, and implantation of
3587.20s: false memory or false information
3588.64s: intended to subjugate and enslave the
3591.20s: local ASB population. Check. Number
3594.80s: three, takeover of natural resources by
3597.28s: the invading isbs. Check. Number four,
3599.44s: political, economic, and social slavery
3601.28s: of the local population. These
3602.64s: activities continue in present time. All
3605.20s: of the isbes on Earth have been members
3607.12s: of one or more of these activities in
3609.20s: the past. Both as an invader or as part
3611.76s: of the population being invaded. There
3613.84s: are no saints in this universe. Very few
3617.20s: have avoided or been exempted from
3619.28s: warfare between isbes. Isbes on Earth
3621.84s: are still the victims of this activity
3624.00s: at this very moment. The between lives
3626.56s: amnesia administered to isbes is one of
3629.28s: the mechanisms of an elaborate system of
3631.52s: old empire is be trapped. Well, that's
3633.60s: interesting because again I reference
3635.28s: Dr. Michael Newton and his books journey
3638.16s: of souls and destiny of souls and so
3641.24s: forth where the focus of the books is
3644.48s: life between life. It is about our souls
3646.88s: and where they go between lives. Now
3650.00s: this is proposing that that whole life
3652.88s: between life thing might just
3657.16s: be
3658.92s: controlled suggestion. If you created a
3663.08s: being and wanted to control it, you
3666.48s: would have to have some type
3668.76s: of firewall or some type
3672.12s: of I don't know, some type of screen in
3676.20s: place
3677.72s: where if the physical body underwent
3682.48s: hypnotic regression, it would
3684.72s: automatically tap
3686.92s: into the information that was placed
3689.36s: there for it to be uncovered.
3691.76s: Right. So that all of these past life
3693.92s: regression or between life regressions
3695.92s: are actually just implanted false
3698.08s: memories that are at the base of our
3700.40s: consciousness in case you know we breach
3704.84s: this conscious barrier uh you know like
3709.84s: we do during hypnotic regression. I
3711.76s: don't know just an interesting thought
3713.60s: interesting and terrifying. This
3716.00s: operation is managed by an illicit
3717.76s: renegade secret police force of the old
3720.16s: empire using false provocation
3722.24s: operations to disguise their activity in
3724.64s: order to prevent detection by their own
3726.32s: government, the domain, and by the
3728.24s: victims of their
3729.56s: activities. They are mind control
3732.00s: methods developed by government
3735.08s: psychiatrists. Earth is a ghetto planet.
3739.04s: It is the result of an intergalactic
3742.00s: holocaust. ISBes have been sentenced to
3745.28s: Earth either because one they are too
3748.72s: viciously insane or perverse to function
3750.96s: as a part of any civilization no matter
3753.20s: how degraded or corrupt. Two or they are
3757.60s: a revolutionary threat to the social,
3760.00s: economic and political cast system that
3762.40s: has been so carefully built and brutally
3764.24s: enforced in the old empire. Biological
3766.56s: bodies are specifically designed and
3768.24s: designated as the lowest order of entity
3770.56s: in the old empire cast system. When an
3773.36s: ISB is sent to Earth and then tricked or
3776.08s: coerced into operating in a biological
3778.08s: body, they're actually in a prison
3779.60s: inside a prison. Okay, it gets worse.
3783.24s: Cool. Um, I will say it is kind of funny
3787.04s: that they're like, you're either a
3788.48s: deviant pervert or, you know, a freedom
3792.56s: fighter. And I bet like most people
3794.96s: watching out there are like, "Well, I
3797.44s: think I know which one I am." It's kind
3800.16s: of insane that like they
3802.20s: just, you know, put two categories out
3804.72s: there. Number three, in an effort to
3806.80s: permanently and irreversibly rid the old
3809.04s: empire of such
3810.52s: untouchables. The ethereal the eternal
3814.36s: identity, memory, and abilities of every
3817.44s: Isby is forcefully erased. this final
3820.24s: solution uh was conceived and carried
3822.32s: out by the psychopathic criminals who
3824.08s: are controlled by the old empire. I mean
3825.84s: that's that's a bit of a you know final
3829.92s: solution in
3831.24s: quotes obviously referring to Hitler and
3834.32s: yep here we go. The mass extermination
3837.12s: of untouchables and prison camps created
3838.96s: by Germany during World War II were
3841.04s: recently revealed. Likewise, the isbes
3844.00s: of Earth are the victims of spiritual
3847.32s: eradication and eternal slavery inside
3850.00s: frail biological bodies inspired by the
3852.80s: same kind of craven hatred in the old
3855.24s: empire. So, we're just
3857.88s: basically incarnations of the worst of
3861.28s: the worst the universe has to offer or
3865.84s: some of the best. The kind and creative
3868.24s: inmates of Earth are continuously
3870.00s: tortured by butchers and lunatics who
3872.16s: are controlled by the old empire prison
3874.00s: operators. The so-called civilizations
3876.24s: of Earth, from the age of useless
3878.16s: pyramids to the age of nuclear
3880.00s: holocaust, have been a colossal waste of
3882.48s: natural resources, a perverted use of
3884.96s: intelligence, and an overt oppression of
3887.52s: the spiritual essence of every single
3889.52s: isby on the planet. If the domain sent
3892.32s: ships to every corner of the universe in
3894.32s: search of hell, their quest could end on
3898.44s: Earth. What greater brutality can be
3901.20s: inflicted on anyone than to erase their
3903.52s: spiritual awareness, identity, ability,
3905.76s: and memory that is the essence of
3908.36s: oneself.
3909.88s: Oof.
3913.00s: Wow. Yeah, that would be a big tragedy,
3915.68s: wouldn't it? The majority of the lost
3918.00s: members of the domain force have
3919.92s: followed the general progression of
3921.36s: Western civilization from India into the
3923.36s: Middle East, then to Chaldi and Babylon
3926.56s: into Egypt, through Archa, Greece, Rome
3930.24s: into Europe, to the Western Hemisphere,
3932.08s: and then all around the world. The
3934.24s: members of the Lost Battalion and so
3936.08s: many other isbes on Earth could be
3938.00s: valuable citizens of the domain, not
3940.08s: including those who are vicious
3941.28s: criminals or perverts. Unfortunately,
3943.84s: there has been no workable method
3945.28s: conceived to emancipate the Isbes from
3948.08s: Earth. Therefore, as a matter of common
3951.20s: logic, as well as the official policy of
3953.92s: the domain, it is safer and more
3956.56s: sensible to avoid contact with the Isby
3959.28s: population of Earth until such time as
3962.00s: the proper resources can be allocated to
3964.64s: locate and destroy the Old Empire force
3967.60s: screen in amnesia machinery and develop
3970.48s: a therapy to restore the memory of an
3974.08s: Isby.
3977.20s: So once again, we're kind of we're kind
3979.20s: of here waiting for our ride, but um
3982.64s: ain't quite ready. You know, one thing I
3985.28s: will say though, if this is the worst,
3988.40s: how can we still feel love? How can we
3990.64s: still feel joy, right? Maybe the amount
3993.92s: of joy we feel just pale pales in
3995.92s: comparison to what's actually out there.
3997.60s: Who knows? But I'm quite happy with this
4000.24s: place. And if I can be happy in hell,
4004.48s: well, I can be happy anywhere.
4008.28s: So, I'll leave it at that. Let me know
4011.20s: your thoughts below. There's a lot to
4013.04s: digest there. Some of this, you know,
4017.12s: does
4019.00s: feel somewhat like it could have legs.
4024.80s: You know, I again, I'm not here to ask
4027.28s: you to believe or not to believe, and
4028.88s: I'm not going to tell you whether or not
4030.32s: I believe it or don't believe it, but I
4032.32s: do feel like it's very interesting in
4034.40s: that some of the concepts that have been
4037.20s: talked about here, uh, were actually
4040.00s: mentioned by the Farsight community, who
4042.08s: I've looked into quite extensively
4044.08s: recently, which is a group of like
4046.16s: remote viewers that task themselves with
4048.08s: certain things. They remote view this
4050.24s: book, uh, for instance. they'll remote
4052.00s: view Bob Lazar for instance and all
4054.08s: these other things that are just out of
4056.00s: our reach and then you know report on
4058.16s: that and they have like different remote
4060.20s: viewers. So a lot of the stuff that
4062.32s: comes up in here you know has been
4064.88s: corroborated by them and take that for
4067.36s: what it's worth. A lot of other you know
4070.64s: books when you look at Journey of Souls
4072.72s: and you know you look at some of the
4074.80s: stuff that uh Matt Brown the
4077.44s: whistleblower has talked about. Yeah.
4079.60s: There just seems to be more and more
4082.24s: corroborating evidence, but you know, is
4085.76s: what it is. It's a story for now, maybe
4090.16s: forever, but an interesting one at that.
4092.72s: Thanks for watching, guys. We'll see you
4094.24s: on the next video. Peace and love.
4098.00s: [Music]
