3.84s: me I've been asked to go to
6.84s: S4 way down under the ground and he said
9.68s: they going in he saw he saw actual
12.80s: saucers that were there he said you know
15.60s: kind of just floating there they were
18.12s: there like three or four of them
19.24s: underground yeah down underground at S4
22.20s: we come into this area and he said there
23.84s: was this this room there with this big
27.32s: uh one-way mirror and there was a being
31.16s: there his Commander went in to the room
34.80s: uh and was having this telepathic
37.12s: communication with them and they said
38.72s: they had these index cards that had the
41.92s: questions and answers and one of the
44.24s: questions that they asked him he said
46.00s: was you know like where are you guys
48.20s: from and what are you doing here right
50.00s: the ET guy said I am one of a a PE a
53.72s: person person from different star
56.12s: systems in our galaxy uh who have all
59.44s: been Ted with going around together to
61.96s: different planets where life has
63.80s: actually begun and to monitor what how
67.32s: it's
69.04s: going that's where I saw the photographs
72.48s: of a crash retrieval wasn't any doubt
74.96s: about what it was it was not Roswell
77.48s: because it was snow on the ground there
79.60s: was snow on the ground you can see in
81.84s: the photos that it had plowed it plowed
84.40s: through this field and it plowed up all
86.40s: the dirt into the in the snow I saw that
88.96s: there were symbols actually on the the
92.28s: bottom or along the bottom of the Dome
95.36s: that was at the top of this it was a
97.08s: classic saucer I actually traced every
100.04s: single one of the symbols oh yeah sure
104.08s: yeah here I'll I'll show you could you
105.92s: draw what you saw in the picture yeah
107.40s: here here's the here's the big Hillside
109.44s: and so I can see that all along the
111.84s: bottom right along the bottom of the
113.68s: disc right here bottom of the Dome the
115.48s: bottom of the Dome that I could see
117.56s: these symbols and they they look like
120.92s: [Music]
123.56s: this the Church of
125.64s: Scientology believes that there's a
128.64s: major confrontation going on between
131.84s: reptilian extraterrestrial species from
134.64s: Zeta reticuli and the uh people from the
138.48s: PES in the next 4year period we're
141.40s: getting set to lay the groundwork for
144.08s: establishing the protocols that are
146.08s: going to govern our relationship with
147.80s: this extraterrestrial civilization for
150.00s: the next 10,000
152.24s: years uh and I was sworn to secrecy when
155.28s: I was told about the Pion it's called
157.48s: psionic assists that there's a
160.84s: technology that they've got that devel
163.72s: that is amping up the capacities of
169.16s: individuals to do uh telepathic
172.68s: communication and it's very dangerous
175.40s: and it's frying out the brains of people
179.24s: that they're
180.40s: testing if you had full authority to
182.60s: subpoena anyone or any person or any
186.20s: entity who would it
190.35s: [Music]
192.36s: be are you aware of any whistleblowers
194.84s: or evidence not known by the public
197.20s: about to come out in the next
201.20s: months
206.12s: yes I was wondering if you could find an
208.88s: answer for this question is it possible
211.40s: that the National Institute of Health in
213.20s: Bethesda Maryland is working with
217.20s: non-terrestrial biological material the
220.28s: reason why I asked that is because back
222.12s: when I was uh a roofer I went to go work
226.08s: at that particular installation on a
228.16s: building with three smoke stacks and
230.52s: when we were on our way up to the top of
232.20s: the building a guy came out of the room
235.20s: with a triangular headed
237.20s: entity that was maybe about 2 and 1/2 ft
240.96s: tall in a jar of liquid and as soon as
244.44s: he saw me and my partner he told us that
247.16s: he was very sorry and he retreated back
249.64s: into the room ladies and gentlemen today
252.64s: we are joined by Danny Sheen who is a
254.84s: constitutional lawyer who's been
256.88s: involved in some of the most important
258.16s: cases in US history including Watergate
260.76s: the Pentagon papers Iran Contra uh he's
263.92s: also a key figure in UAP disclosure and
267.16s: an advocate for government transparency
270.00s: uh he's represented people like Lewis
272.44s: alzando and he's also founded uh the new
276.16s: paradigm Institute and has been um sorry
281.08s: uh your your role with with uh the
283.32s: disclosure project as well you you're
285.44s: chief counil 20 years i' general counsel
287.80s: for the disclosure project for for Dr
289.84s: Steven Greer that's right um so
292.64s: obviously this makes you one of the most
294.44s: important figures in the fight for UAP
296.72s: transparency today so thank you Danny
299.36s: she for joining me I appreciate it thank
302.00s: you Chris yeah absolutely I'm so looking
305.04s: forward to today's conversation because
306.64s: it isn't every day that I get to speak
309.12s: with uh first of all a Harvard trained
311.24s: lawyer also studied uh Divinity School
314.36s: um you've got just probably the thickest
316.56s: resume out of anyone who's ever sat here
319.72s: um and possibly anyone will ever meet so
321.92s: it it is truly truly an honor to be able
324.16s: to chat with you about about all this I
326.32s: appreciate it I appreciate a chance to
328.04s: do it yeah so um for those of you
332.20s: interested in what Danny's doing I would
335.00s: highly encourage you I do this at the
336.44s: top so people have a chance to look at
338.28s: it but uh go check out the new paradigm
340.64s: Institute and what they're doing I left
342.24s: the link below um it's it's wonderful
345.24s: what you guys have set up and how long
346.68s: you've been working on this I didn't
348.04s: know we've talked a lot behind the
349.52s: scenes about this and we'll get into
351.32s: that also a little bit later sure uh
353.68s: first I kind of I've got a bunch of
356.36s: questions here that I want to get to but
358.96s: ultimately I would like us to use this
361.64s: time to get a little
363.00s: weird um you're you're someone who I've
366.24s: been fascinated with uh with your
367.92s: interviews because you always have these
370.12s: really interesting nuggets of
371.64s: information that I've never heard
373.12s: anywhere else and I I also want to let
376.56s: the audience know that this isn't coming
378.92s: from you know a lot of times there is
381.04s: this frustration with I can't say this
383.60s: or I can't say that right right but
385.56s: you're a public interest lawyer that's
387.32s: right can you give us a little bit of a
388.68s: definition of what that means well it's
390.68s: it's interesting it's a it's sort of a
392.80s: thing that we created uh back in the 70s
396.56s: that I graduated from Law School in 1970
399.72s: and we were the classes that were coming
402.52s: out of the law schools at that time
404.48s: didn't think that any of the other kind
406.48s: of slots uh were appropriate and we'd
409.44s: end up working for major corporations or
412.04s: we'd work for the government as a
413.32s: prosecutor or a public defender's office
415.84s: and so the one spot that they had to go
418.40s: to was ACLU
420.48s: if you were going to be doing kind of
421.80s: civil liberties work but ACLU was not as
425.88s: aggressive uh as a lot of us wanted to
428.80s: be so uh at the Harvard civil rights law
431.44s: review I had sent out letters to lawyers
434.64s: all around the country saying that you
436.64s: know if you have a really interesting
438.04s: and important constitutional law issue
440.24s: send it to us and let us we'll pick some
443.20s: and we'll write briefs and stuff about
444.76s: it and that's where the the very first
447.24s: case we did ended up esta lishing the
450.00s: right of journalists to protect their
451.48s: confidential news sources so so that uh
454.52s: so it it went all the way to the United
456.04s: States Supreme Court uh and it
458.28s: established uh the right of journalists
460.12s: to protect our confidential news sources
462.12s: against government compelled disclosure
464.20s: and grand juries mostly and so we ended
467.48s: up making friends with a lot of
468.80s: investigative journalists and so there
470.96s: were we started discovering all kinds of
473.08s: uh issues that were going on that needed
474.96s: to have lawyers and so we kind of
477.16s: developed this whole kind of public
478.84s: interest trust uh of lawyers alog
481.96s: together working on these things uh and
484.28s: so we developed this kind of category of
486.16s: a public interest lawyer so whenever I
489.28s: agreed to represent someone later I
491.72s: would say look you know you've come to
493.68s: me usually and ask me to represent you
496.56s: uh and it's because you've got some kind
498.16s: of a cause a really important thing that
500.44s: you're trying to achieve as a matter of
502.32s: public policy I agree with you on that
505.48s: otherwise I wouldn't be representing you
507.56s: and so you have to understand that in
509.08s: addition representing you and your
511.28s: particular interest in this you know we
513.64s: represent the issue itself uh and the
516.52s: people who need to get access to this
518.40s: information so we have to have an
520.24s: agreement kind of upfront that uh you
522.84s: know that I'm here working with you on
525.80s: this uh and we've got our own public
528.80s: interest objectives uh and so that uh
531.72s: you need to understand that as a
533.16s: condition of our working together so
534.52s: I've had those conversations with Dr
537.48s: John Mack for example in Harvard uh I
540.40s: had that conversation with Marsha Smith
542.36s: when she asked me to come and work on
544.52s: the major investigation for the uh the
547.36s: uh Library of Congress the Congressional
549.16s: research Service uh for for president uh
551.92s: Carter you know and I explained that to
554.08s: Luis alzando I've explained it to uh you
557.28s: know to Stephen uh Basset when I was
560.44s: working with them you know so I've had a
562.28s: whole series of these clients as it were
565.84s: it wasn't that popular when I was at
567.44s: this Law Firm the Cahill firm we
569.88s: represented the New York Times and NBC
572.72s: uh you know cuz I would tell them that
574.72s: that you know I'm I'm not going to just
577.08s: do whatever it is you tell me to do you
579.28s: know um in in fact after two years at
581.60s: the firm they explained to me that they
583.84s: thought that uh my interests were not
585.92s: necessarily the same as all of their
588.36s: clients uh in sort of ask red flag ask
591.28s: me to leave you know and I said no I'm
593.84s: fine I'm fine you know I'm I'm
596.08s: representing the New York Times NBC and
598.36s: doing you know I get 50% of my time
600.60s: doing public interest cases you know so
603.60s: that's how I was at Attica prison the
605.12s: night everybody was killed there you
607.16s: know I you know did the represented the
610.00s: the men in the Manhattan House of
611.48s: Correction for men dud that filed the
613.44s: big lawsuit against them for cruel
615.00s: unusual punishment you know and uh lots
618.12s: of these other cases that I was doing um
621.16s: and then I said it to Lee Bailey F Lee
624.16s: Bailey when he asked me to come to join
626.16s: his firm when we were doing the
627.72s: Watergate burglary case and for example
630.52s: I investigated the reason why the
634.48s: trafficante people were in the Watergate
636.68s: hotel right yeah Bailey didn't seem to
639.36s: care or he may have already known but I
642.48s: conducted that investigation that's how
643.96s: I figured out what was going on why they
646.04s: were in the Watergate hotel and all that
648.12s: so this is all um because this seems to
650.64s: be
652.08s: the mo uh that the the through line with
655.92s: your work is that you're all about
658.08s: transparency yeah you're really really
660.24s: fighting for the people's right to know
662.76s: about UAP about this uh Consciousness
666.36s: work but also about these other fronts
668.60s: uh these other civil uh cases that
670.64s: you've that you've represented and um
672.96s: being a you know being this type of
675.48s: lawyer also a lot of this is pro Bona
677.72s: work it's all proon it's all pro Bona
679.76s: work well except when I was at the law
681.40s: firm they they it was kind of bizarre I
684.32s: was actually getting paid for it you
686.16s: know it was kind of unique cuz I wasn't
687.76s: doing anything I was working all the
688.88s: time so I didn't ever get to use the use
691.08s: it that's a surprise to a lot of people
693.44s: I think you know most people when they
694.80s: hear lawyer they think oh this person's
697.32s: all about the bills and all about and
699.40s: it's not necessarily the case it
700.68s: actually isn't the case at all with you
702.16s: and um so you know to hear that and this
704.56s: extends Beyond uh just legalities this
708.96s: actually touches into uh like TS
711.80s: clearance opportunities that you've
713.36s: denied as well that's right for the same
715.44s: reasons oh yeah no I refuse to ever
718.28s: accept a security parents because then
720.32s: I'll never get to tell anybody about all
722.04s: the other stuff that I know yeah uh you
724.24s: know of course I spent 10 years uh at
727.20s: Jesuit headquarters yes in Washington DC
729.68s: as their general counsel and what they
731.32s: call their Social Ministry Office and so
734.12s: I was into this whole thing of not
736.36s: needing to get paid for anything you
738.76s: know or charging anybody anything and it
740.88s: and it therefore gives you the
742.40s: additional uh freedom to say look we're
745.24s: representing the public interest here
746.84s: you're here because you agree with me
749.36s: that we have to be meeting the public
751.00s: interest so you know you're not paying
753.00s: me yeah you know uh you can't be strong
754.92s: armed by a paycheck yeah yeah but even
756.96s: though I joke once in a while I mean
758.20s: people say you know what do you what do
759.96s: you guess is going on here what do you
761.56s: guess about this or that I say you know
763.08s: I don't get paid to guess you know and
765.76s: of course I don't get paid at all as it
767.72s: as it turns out uh so so we raise money
770.52s: we get contributions from people that
772.32s: get tax deductions and just like ACLU or
775.28s: NAACP or anything else so that's that's
778.56s: I've set those up over the years I think
780.68s: that's uh tremendously commendable and
783.36s: obviously very important for this
784.84s: conversation that we're about to have as
786.16s: well because um I think we needed that
788.20s: at the top because there is a growing
791.04s: frustration among the community with
793.92s: this um you know with with this topic
796.84s: because people want to they you know
799.04s: they don't want people to have some
800.40s: weird hidden agenda because that has
802.28s: happened in the past and there's been
803.96s: you know we've been slighted before by
805.72s: this stuff and so I think I think people
807.36s: are um you know
809.68s: to to they're they're just really
811.92s: critical of of whoever you know talks
814.36s: about this subject so I thought that was
816.04s: really really commendable but also
817.72s: really important to get out of the way
819.28s: great um right before we were setting up
822.12s: the cameras you had mentioned something
824.20s: that uh we spoke about last night now um
827.52s: You' mentioned this gentleman Oscar wolf
830.56s: oh Oscar yes yeah yeah I mean this is an
833.96s: amazing story um it is a great story
837.12s: yeah because it ties into
839.88s: S4 uh which ties into inevitably Bob
843.00s: Lazar but also Dan burish and all these
845.96s: other really Fringe sort of cases um but
850.24s: there's a really interesting portion of
852.44s: the story that you're about to tell and
854.40s: that has to do with a deathbed
855.72s: confession yes that's right oh the FBI
858.12s: finds secret JFK assassination
862.24s: records but how can I trust
865.56s: this that's why this video today is
868.24s: sponsored by ground news in today's
870.64s: landscape it's quite difficult to locate
873.96s: unbiased news especially regarding uaps
877.76s: and UFOs and secret documents covered up
881.24s: by the
882.48s: government where do you look well ground
885.52s: news compiles all of the internet's
887.72s: articles into one place and tells you
890.68s: which ones are centered left leaning
892.64s: right leaning uh which ones have private
895.00s: Equity interests in them which ones are
897.36s: geared more towards marketing and lets
899.76s: you choose the news you want to read
902.04s: that isn't affected by some type of
904.04s: hidden agenda take this story for
906.00s: example the FBI finds secret JFK
909.40s: assassination records well on the ground
911.44s: news app it gives me a full biased
914.40s: breakdown as you can see 14% of the bias
917.40s: is leaning towards the left 43% is
920.28s: leaning towards the right and 43% is
923.28s: right down the middle if we look at a
925.08s: left leaning article it says scoop FBI
927.68s: finds secret JFK assassin records after
930.04s: Trump
930.92s: order now if we look at the right it
933.04s: says FBI uncovers thousands of
935.28s: undisclosed records regarding JFK
938.04s: assassination and right down the middle
940.32s: FBI finds secret JFK assassination
942.60s: records and you can see how even the
944.36s: article's title might sway you one way
947.40s: or the other so if you're demanding
949.52s: transparency on the UFO and UAP topic
951.88s: why not also demand transparency on the
953.92s: news that you're consuming subscribe to

971.32s: wolf and he calls me on the phone uh at
974.72s: uh my headquarters office in Washington
977.72s: and wants me to come and see him that
979.84s: he's dying uh he's in a hospice actually
983.24s: uh and he wants me to come see him and I
984.84s: said well look you know I've got a lot
986.44s: of things to do I've got a lot of people
987.96s: I need to see you know why should I make
990.32s: this a priority he said that you know I
992.24s: was he said in the classified portion of
994.72s: Project Blue Book I was fully employed
997.76s: there uh as a US Army uh in the
1002.36s: stenographer uh and uh and bookkeeper so
1005.68s: I said okay uh so I fly out there he was
1009.24s: out in Minnesota I so I flew into
1011.36s: Minneapolis and rent a little car and
1013.08s: drove up into this little teeny town
1015.12s: where he was so I go to the little
1017.20s: Hospice place and there is with all the
1019.56s: tubes in him and in his arms and he's
1021.84s: got one of those little things on Wheels
1023.20s: he's carry he's having to walk around
1025.20s: with um and so we sat down uh and he
1028.24s: started explaining to me that he was
1030.64s: assigned to the portion of Project Blue
1033.20s: Book uh that they never admitted they
1035.76s: had which was over 700 uh incidences
1039.92s: incidents in which they couldn't
1041.84s: conceivably explain it away there were
1043.96s: too many people had seen it the
1045.72s: witnesses who had seen it were too
1047.04s: credible they had photographs or video
1049.12s: or something of it and they just
1051.04s: couldn't call it swamp gas you know or
1053.60s: you know search lights on the bottom of
1055.32s: clouds yeah yeah right or Venus in the
1058.20s: morning so so he was in that section he
1061.36s: said he started telling me so I'm
1062.64s: sitting down with him you know just like
1064.16s: this you know we're sitting off in a
1065.24s: little table at the little hospice and
1067.92s: he starts telling about how that he was
1069.52s: a clerk typist from the US Army he was
1072.04s: in the US Army assigned as a clerk
1074.16s: typist to this unit and uh he would just
1076.88s: be in the office all the time and he
1079.24s: gave me the name of the base where he
1080.60s: was and everything uh and uh and so I
1083.40s: started pressing him to you know say who
1086.32s: was your commander you know what was the
1087.64s: name of your unit you know what years
1089.44s: were you there Etc uh and he was
1093.00s: forthcoming and telling me this stuff
1095.00s: right uh and then he he gets the point
1097.48s: of saying that he would stay in the
1099.60s: office and they had these guys would get
1101.72s: assigned from different military units
1104.12s: mly US Air Force and and but some army
1106.64s: people and they would come through and
1108.44s: they would spend a year sometimes two
1110.64s: you know going out and doing field
1112.20s: interviews uh and interviewing the
1114.00s: people and trying to either talk them
1115.92s: out of believing that it was a UFO or
1118.16s: but finally coming back and saying look
1119.96s: at uh this is the real deal you know
1122.20s: here's my information and he would take
1123.96s: it all down and and keep the records
1125.76s: right then they would go and others
1128.12s: would come but he stayed uh All Through
1130.40s: The Years uh at the at the in the
1132.76s: special Division and it turns out it was
1135.08s: because he belonged to the same church
1138.96s: the commander of that unit was in there
1141.36s: was a thing called the worldwide Church
1143.00s: of God uh and it was this really
1146.44s: fundamentalist deep kind of Conservative
1149.80s: Christian sect uh and so that he got on
1153.84s: really well with the commander so he
1155.84s: ends up the commander comes to him one
1157.76s: day and he says look uh I need you to
1159.68s: come with me I've been asked to go to
1162.96s: S4 uh uh out in the the the West we have
1167.20s: to leave cuz he was like in New Jersey
1169.92s: so he said and uh he didn't tell him
1172.88s: what they were going to do there he just
1174.20s: you have to I want you to come with me
1176.16s: so we they go together and they go to
1178.00s: Area 51 then they take them all the way
1179.92s: like 11 miles away or something they go
1181.36s: to S4 do you know do you know Sor to
1182.96s: interrupt do you know if they took a bus
1184.36s: or anything or how did they got to say
1186.12s: that somebody somebody took them from
1189.32s: Area
1190.32s: 51 he he said they were he started out
1193.80s: just kind of saying I went to area I was
1195.52s: at for Area 51 then they put them in
1197.64s: this vehicle and took him and his boss
1200.28s: drove drove to to the S4 yeah so he said
1204.68s: they way down under the ground and he
1206.48s: said they go and he saw he saw actual
1209.84s: saucers that were there he said you know
1212.64s: kind of just floating there they were
1215.12s: there like three or four of them
1216.28s: underground yeah down underground at S4
1219.12s: and they were just like in these little
1221.24s: uh uh hangers little little like little
1223.84s: garage like thing each one of them a
1225.68s: little area and they were just kind of
1226.92s: floating there and he was kind of you
1229.24s: know floored by that and they they went
1231.88s: and they said that we we went into this
1233.68s: other section and we come into this area
1235.76s: and he said there was this this room
1238.24s: there with this big uh one-way mirror
1241.56s: like and you could see through into the
1243.20s: room uh but you could tell it wasn't a
1245.32s: window it was like a mirror and there
1247.36s: was a UFO being there but it was tall it
1251.60s: was like like 5 and 1/2 ft tall and it
1254.80s: had like this little they had a little
1256.48s: blue jumpsuit on him and uh
1259.16s: he was in the room uh and he he thought
1262.60s: it was demonic he said and he didn't
1265.44s: want to go near it and but his his his
1269.36s: Commander went in to the room uh and was
1272.36s: having this telepathic communication
1274.92s: with him and he was afraid of the the
1277.56s: being he was afraid of it yeah uh so he
1279.76s: stayed outside uh and the people that
1282.24s: were there they obviously were having
1285.12s: some process they were going through
1286.72s: with this ET guy uh and that they'd been
1290.24s: questioning him and they said they had
1292.16s: these index cards that had the questions
1295.36s: and answers that he had provided they
1297.40s: were going to show them to uh to Wolf
1300.20s: right and so he's so in sorry index
1303.00s: cards uh they would of the
1305.12s: communications that they had previously
1307.04s: yes they were earlier ones and they
1308.24s: would they would transcribe them yes
1309.72s: they were all transcribed and he didn't
1311.32s: tell me whether they were printed out or
1313.36s: typed or what they were I I didn't he
1315.88s: just said they were they had it there
1317.68s: and one of the questions that they asked
1319.44s: him he said was you know like where are
1322.16s: you guys from and what are you doing
1323.64s: here right and he said uh the ET guy
1326.84s: said uh you know that I am one of uh PE
1331.08s: a p person from different star systems
1334.64s: in our galaxy uh who have all been
1337.20s: tasked with going around together to
1339.40s: different planets where life has
1341.28s: actually begun and to monitor what how
1344.80s: it's going he said and uh uh and just
1347.96s: get giving reports on this uh and so
1351.20s: he'd been asked to follow because well
1352.80s: like who's in charge of that who's
1354.72s: tasked you to do all that and he said
1357.28s: well you you people would would probably
1360.16s: consider God uh but it's very different
1364.32s: than you think it is that's what he said
1366.80s: he said and I didn't believe him uh
1369.48s: because I thought it was demonic and
1371.48s: I've never told anybody never told my
1373.24s: wife I never told anybody about this uh
1376.00s: but I he said I'm dying as you can see
1378.52s: he said so I wanted to tell you that
1381.40s: that this is true so that's what he
1382.96s: explained to me so and and the reason I
1385.80s: was telling you is we were joking about
1387.60s: you know failing to turn on the recorder
1389.44s: cuz I had this little camera that I
1391.24s: brought with me the staff said you got
1393.16s: to record this guy so I put it on the
1395.44s: table and I he so I I got it with I
1398.92s: forgot to turn the sound on you know so
1401.40s: I I sat there I interviewed the guy for
1402.80s: like a whole Saturday afternoon then all
1405.08s: Sunday morning the next day I'm just I'm
1407.60s: double checking myself double check your
1409.40s: mics you know but it was really a bummer
1412.00s: oh my gosh but anyway uh that that that
1414.56s: was uh wolf wow yeah so I'm I'm
1419.12s: fortunate that I I have things like that
1421.84s: that happened in the past to get to talk
1423.40s: to interesting people you know that
1425.52s: instantly makes me think of Dan bur with
1428.12s: jrod yeah you know so many people
1431.00s: dismissed that
1432.60s: story it would be interesting to see him
1435.56s: and Bob and all them just be Vindicated
1438.20s: one one day you know you well bur you
1441.08s: know the T three different times that I
1443.28s: had people set up meetings that I was
1445.56s: supposed to go and meet burish and every
1447.80s: single time you know he have some kind
1450.44s: of an excuse like you know his mother's
1452.04s: horse died or you know right you know
1454.56s: and and uh that his wife had decided he
1456.88s: didn't she want talking to anybody
1458.44s: anymore and so finally I just sort of
1460.72s: dropped it I've got a whole stack of
1463.20s: stuff in my office uh there uh of all
1466.84s: the burish stuff and lots of details
1469.16s: about it so someday I may you have to
1471.48s: sit down go through it again and and
1473.16s: talk with him what's one question you
1474.92s: would ask Dan bur if you could ask him
1476.72s: right now and it would be like the last
1477.88s: time you ever saw him what would that
1479.56s: question be does he have any idea of
1483.12s: where the where jrod you know is now or
1487.36s: is there anybody else that are there any
1489.00s: other beings that we are presently in
1492.28s: direct communication with you know
1494.12s: because we've gotten a lot of
1495.16s: information since that time of different
1497.28s: people that say they've been in
1499.88s: underground facilities and that there
1502.32s: are actually different beings there from
1505.44s: different species yeah actually working
1508.48s: together in some of these bases I me
1511.00s: some people have some type of Coalition
1513.76s: yeah that we or agreement that some
1515.88s: something now the what we're going to do
1517.72s: now at the new paradigm Institute now
1519.84s: that we've turned our kind of full
1521.40s: attention to this because this this work
1524.04s: has been basically kind of ancillary to
1526.64s: a lot of the other major stuff that I
1528.16s: would was doing sure you know doing the
1530.32s: Iran cont case the Ken silkwood case you
1532.84s: know uh and all these but you so I would
1535.40s: go and work with Dr Mack on the side
1537.96s: basically and and work as general
1539.88s: counsel to his peer group the project
1542.04s: for Extraordinary experience research
1544.04s: but it was all kind of like on my free
1546.76s: time uh and but now that since Luis
1551.60s: alzando called me and asked me to
1554.36s: represent him you know I've I've given
1556.80s: this kind of a higher priority
1558.84s: and our whole organization the Romero
1561.24s: Institute that is the progeny of our old
1563.92s: christic The christic Institute is what
1566.20s: we set up out of Jesuit headquarters
1568.04s: yeah uh to do the Karen silwood case
1570.08s: originally uh then we did The Three Mile
1572.68s: Island case to stop them from pumping
1575.04s: all the radioactive affluence into the
1576.88s: cesco Hanah River we did the Greensboro
1579.76s: case against the Klux Clan and the
1581.32s: American Nazi party that gunned down all
1583.64s: those labor organizers down in
1585.48s: Greensboro uh we did the Eddie karthan
1588.32s: the first elected mayor in the black
1590.32s: delta Mississippi first-degree murder
1592.68s: case where we caught the guys doing it
1594.44s: and and put them on the stand and broke
1596.52s: there's lots of really good stories
1597.88s: there but but th those are kind of the
1600.04s: cases in Chief that I was doing all the
1601.96s: time and all the other stuff was like
1604.76s: weekends uh and and I would you know go
1607.68s: and do talks at the inter International
1610.80s: you know uh UFO Congress for example and
1614.16s: and then these Consciousness things
1615.88s: conscious life living Expo and so I
1618.32s: would just go and do these on the
1620.52s: weekend and then come back and go right
1622.00s: back to work on Monday but this is what
1623.80s: you were always really passionate about
1626.20s: this is what drove your curiosity for
1629.00s: years you know we'd spoken last night
1630.52s: and You' said initially you'd set out to
1632.32s: be an astronaut yes uh ear yeah early on
1635.44s: in your you know you want to join the
1636.92s: Air Force you were like this is my way
1638.80s: into becoming an astronaut that's right
1641.48s: and the reason you wanted to become an
1643.04s: astronaut cuz I I wanted to get to meet
1645.84s: people from other star systems and
1648.32s: thought that during my lifetime this is
1650.20s: what was going to happen we were going
1651.92s: to in the hundred years or so that I had
1654.36s: here in this in this particular
1656.32s: Incarnation you know that we would be
1659.00s: actually encountering the beings and so
1661.28s: I told that to Jacob Javis as I
1663.12s: mentioned to you last night you know I
1664.64s: was one of the top three uh nominees for
1667.24s: the Air Force Academy appointment in
1670.16s: 1963 uh I know I don't look that all but
1673.68s: but the bottom line is you know when he
1675.36s: asked me why I wanted to be an astronaut
1677.00s: I said well because I want to get to go
1679.56s: into outer space and get to meet these
1681.60s: other beings from these other star
1683.44s: systems and and he looked at me he said
1685.24s: you actually believe that there's other
1686.60s: people on planet I said well sure I said
1690.40s: so do you you must I mean you're United
1691.92s: States Senator I said you got to know
1694.28s: that you got to know that you so I was
1696.72s: right from the very beginning I was
1698.52s: dedicated to wanting to do that yeah but
1700.64s: but you know that as I mentioned to you
1702.60s: last night that you know he ended up he
1704.76s: was so stunned by what I said as he said
1707.72s: uh that he look he said look I've got to
1709.24s: admit to you I'm not supposed to say
1710.68s: this but I've already given the
1713.04s: appointment to the Air Force Academy to
1715.24s: the son of one of my major funders and
1717.44s: supporters that's just the way it really
1719.08s: is Dan so but but I I'll give you the
1721.32s: appointment to the Naval Academy you
1723.24s: know and I said I'm not in the boats I
1725.24s: want to fly I want to get to be he said
1727.16s: no no you can get to fly in the Navy and
1728.80s: be I said no I don't want have to go
1730.68s: through all the boat stuff yeah you know
1732.24s: I want to do the planes uh and so he
1734.48s: said well look you can you can get your
1736.36s: the appointment from your Congressman he
1737.88s: said
1739.20s: uh and you don't have to have the
1740.28s: senatorial appointment you know there
1741.80s: there's you know like a few dozen
1744.84s: Congressional appointments from New York
1746.84s: you who's your Congressman he said and I
1748.52s: said it's Carlton King he said oh I know
1750.96s: Carl King I I'll give him a call he said
1753.28s: I'll just tell him to give it to you
1755.80s: well it turns out that he gave the
1757.36s: appointment Carlton King gave the
1758.76s: appointment to the son of the Republican
1761.36s: mayor of Glenn's Falls you know who was
1763.28s: number seven in our congressional
1765.20s: district competition number seven you
1766.88s: know yeah and so I said oh our our
1768.68s: government I thought is a little bit Out
1770.08s: Of Tune here I said so I I better become
1772.64s: a lawyer and then I can work a little
1775.20s: while and help get our government back
1777.16s: into tune and and do and actually when I
1779.52s: got out to practice I discovered that
1781.60s: that our government wasn't just a little
1783.04s: out of tune it was playing an entirely
1785.68s: different song yeah than we'd been
1787.76s: taught you know uh and so that I got
1790.20s: caught in this and doing the Iran Contra
1793.20s: case doing the Pentagon papers case and
1795.32s: and discovering this entire Nether world
1798.16s: but all the while still yeah still
1800.92s: pursuing nhi yeah so well actually it
1803.80s: reached out to me a bit uh I was at
1806.24s: Jesuit headquarters uh right when in
1809.52s: 1976 when President Carter got
1812.40s: elected and when President Carter got
1814.72s: elected is you know one of the very
1816.80s: first things he did before he'd even
1818.72s: come into Washington of having been the
1821.04s: governor down in Georgia he gets elected
1823.68s: president uh on November 4th of 1976 and
1827.24s: on the 19th of November of 1976 he
1830.80s: orders the head of the CIA to come down
1833.88s: to Plains Georgia to come to his home
1836.20s: and brief him on the UFO issue because
1839.12s: he had seen a UFO when he was governor
1842.36s: uh and not just a little light in the
1844.36s: sky but I mean like the length of a
1846.24s: football field away you know and there
1848.92s: were 11 other guys with him who saw it
1851.36s: you know and so he filed the report with
1853.32s: naikap at the time about it and so the
1856.64s: bottom line he he demanded to get
1858.76s: briefed in and the the person who was
1861.32s: the head of the CIA in on November 19th
1864.12s: of 1976 was George H W bush that's right
1868.08s: and uh George Bush said to him look uh
1871.04s: he said what I want to do is before I
1873.04s: decide to whether to brief or not I want
1875.48s: I want you to agree to leave me on as
1878.08s: your CIA director I want to become like
1881.36s: Jer Hoover was for the FBI I want to be
1884.52s: able to stay one Administration after
1886.56s: another in the fuel appoint me to be
1889.16s: your CIA director I'll agree never to
1891.56s: run for public office anywhere ever you
1894.16s: know and uh and uh in President Carter
1897.40s: said president-elect Carter at that time
1899.32s: said no I've got somebody in mind
1901.72s: already you know uh but uh but he so he
1906.24s: wouldn't so Bush refused to brief him
1909.28s: saying he had no need to know the
1911.12s: information and he wasn't going to tell
1913.44s: him so so President Carter after his his
1917.24s: inauguration
1919.04s: contacted the head of the Science and
1921.28s: Technology Committee of the House of
1923.24s: Representatives and asked them if they
1926.08s: would task the Congressional research
1928.68s: service to find out everything that we
1931.60s: knew about the UFOs you know what
1934.00s: documents we had and what Witnesses we
1936.36s: had or anything at all and so that that
1938.52s: was assigned to Dr Mara Smith uh who was
1941.24s: the head of the Science and Technology
1942.88s: division uh you know and people people
1945.36s: all sound it sounds more impressive than
1948.08s: really really was uh you know people go
1950.76s: oh oh Dr Marsha Smith called you you
1953.96s: know at the headquarters just picked up
1955.52s: the phone and called J to no what
1958.36s: happened is is I was uh I was a
1961.04s: candidate for the Jesuit priesthood at
1962.64s: the time uh and uh I was like I was over
1966.00s: going to the mass at uh Dan baragan
1969.04s: father Dan baragan was the roommate of
1971.08s: my Jesuit Superior uh and so I was I
1974.60s: actually represented Baran uh Phil and
1976.80s: Liz mallister during some of them and
1978.84s: some demonstrations and stuff and so
1980.92s: that I would I would go over to the mass
1982.92s: when he was in Washington and I was at
1985.56s: mass and there was this one woman had
1987.84s: this matron young woman who was there
1991.80s: and she came over to me and introduced
1993.68s: herself uh and it was Rosemary chalk and
1996.56s: she was the executive secretary of the
1998.92s: national uh National Academy of Science
2002.12s: uh and she uh said that she wanted to
2005.08s: take me to lunch uh so we went to lunch
2008.08s: and uh she started talking with me she's
2009.88s: saying that oh you know that you've you
2012.52s: know you I know you because you did the
2014.72s: some of the baragan stuff and she was a
2017.16s: big kind of Catholic person U and so she
2020.28s: said uh uh and I looked at you up and I
2023.36s: found out these other cases that you did
2024.96s: you know the Pentagon papers case and
2026.48s: wargate and all that and so she said uh
2028.68s: you must have always wanted to be a
2030.60s: lawyer it just must come naturally to
2033.08s: you I said no actually I wanted to be an
2034.68s: astronaut and she said you wanted to be
2036.52s: an astronaut why you know I oh and I
2040.00s: told her and she said really you know
2042.40s: you're so you're really interested in in
2044.08s: this UFO stuff and I said yeah she said
2046.56s: look you should meet my one of my best
2048.92s: friends Mara Smith she's the head of the
2051.52s: Science and Technology division of the
2053.88s: at the uh Congressional research service
2055.88s: and she's been tasked to do this major
2059.24s: study for for the president you know
2062.44s: would you mind if she gives you a call
2064.52s: and so that's how it happened wow so
2066.24s: Marshall Smith called me uh and I went
2068.84s: to lunch with her and she said asked me
2070.64s: if I could get at the Vatican archives
2074.24s: uh as a Jesuit Council in Washington uh
2077.44s: yeah probably a better better odds yeah
2079.80s: yeah come through the kitchen window
2081.44s: sure you know so so uh I I went back and
2084.76s: checked with Father Bill Davis who was
2086.52s: my Jesuit Superior he checked with Terry
2089.52s: and the other guys that were at the
2091.00s: headquarters and they ran it up the flag
2093.00s: pole to the provincials the 10
2094.84s: provincials of the Jesuit order in the
2096.56s: United States and they agreed to have me
2099.56s: do this that was very important because
2101.80s: that you know that isn't you're you're a
2103.60s: person sort of under Authority uh when
2106.00s: you're in the Jesuit order and so that I
2108.76s: made sure that we got permission all the
2111.12s: way up so I wouldn't run into some you
2113.60s: know Crossfire sure yeah so the bottom
2116.00s: line is that they all agreed for me to
2117.80s: do it and so I did and in that context I
2122.40s: said I want to get at the classified
2124.60s: portions of Project Blue Book and she
2127.36s: said Oh Oh They'll Never they'll never
2129.76s: give us that and I said well you got to
2131.84s: ask you know and tell them who it is and
2134.32s: that I want to give this and uh and so
2137.40s: she said well okay we'll ask and then
2138.92s: she got surprised and a couple weeks
2140.60s: later she called me back and said you
2142.00s: know I'm I'll be darned you know that
2143.56s: they said you could do it and we'll
2145.56s: we'll bring them to this new Madison
2147.84s: Building this brand new building that
2149.44s: just got finished getting built actually
2151.84s: in Washington was nobody even in it you
2154.04s: know that you just go over there uh
2155.92s: bring two different photos official
2157.92s: photo IDs and uh you can get to see
2160.32s: these things that's and that's where I
2161.60s: saw the photographs of a crash retrieval
2165.16s: wasn't any doubt about what it was it
2167.32s: was absolutely photographs you know of
2169.56s: of Crash retrieval which craft which
2172.20s: crash I don't know don't know I don't
2174.20s: know it you know where it was it was not
2176.52s: it was not Roswell because it was snow
2178.88s: on the ground it was snow on the ground
2181.68s: you can see in the photos that it had
2183.48s: plowed it had plowed through this field
2185.96s: and it plowed up all the dirt into in
2187.88s: the snow and it was stuck in the side of
2190.12s: this embankment you know that uh it was
2193.24s: it was kind of like some big Earth and
2195.28s: Bank it was all covered with snow it was
2197.56s: stuck in the side of it so so so the
2200.08s: bottom line is that uh that i' had seen
2202.92s: I I saw the photographs and so what I
2204.72s: did is I I saw that there were symbols
2207.84s: actually on the the bottom along the
2210.96s: bottom of the Dome that was at the top
2213.76s: of this it was a classic saucer you know
2216.00s: with a dome on top and the big W uh and
2219.16s: so I I actually traced every single one
2222.32s: of the symbols you know Trac them I they
2225.56s: told me I couldn't take any notes or
2227.04s: anything so they took my briefcase away
2228.84s: actually before I went in the room but I
2231.00s: I had I had put a a yellow pad you
2233.80s: smuggled it out well I I'd be careful to
2237.56s: use those terms but the bottom line is
2239.84s: it just for some reason when I was you
2241.68s: know I when I showed up at the Madison
2244.12s: building that as I recall it was a
2245.56s: Saturday morning there these two suits
2248.12s: guys out front of the place like said
2250.12s: there was nobody in the building it was
2251.52s: completely empty uh cuz they just got
2254.08s: through building it yeah you know and so
2255.56s: they hear these two suits these big no
2257.20s: neck guys at the door you know and they
2259.56s: sure they weren't Air Force they weren't
2261.44s: OSI guys you can tell OSI guys are
2263.68s: different you know uh these are kind of
2265.68s: no neck dudes no badges no no they just
2269.36s: uh they were there for my ID not me for
2271.96s: their ID I see and so so I had to show
2274.76s: them my ID and they said okay now you go
2276.92s: you go in and you just go down the hall
2279.44s: uh To the Left To That elevator there
2280.88s: and you go down to the basement uh and
2283.08s: you'll see them down there so is I got
2285.28s: in the elevator uh and was going down I
2287.88s: just I just happened to think I I just
2289.64s: open up my briefcase took out a yellow
2291.88s: pad and kind of put it under my arm kind
2294.20s: of lengthwise just put it under my arm
2296.16s: so I get out of the elevator and I look
2298.44s: down I can see the door open down the
2300.16s: hall I can see the light coming out I
2301.92s: can see these other two suits down there
2303.92s: so I go all the way down the hall right
2306.40s: away he said no you got to turn over
2307.96s: that briefcase you you can't bring
2309.88s: anything in there with you uh and they
2311.76s: took it and and they said you can't take
2314.24s: any notes or anything it's just so there
2316.04s: you go they were kind of resenting you
2318.76s: could tell there was this kind of
2320.08s: resentfulness they didn't want to let
2321.64s: you in yeah it didn't seem right yeah
2324.40s: that that I was getting to see this they
2326.08s: didn't seem to agree with it but so I go
2328.80s: in there and here here's this room you
2331.16s: know about I don't know 20 20 ft wide
2333.80s: about maybe 10 15 ft deep and there were
2336.64s: these three big uh cardboard foldout
2340.36s: tables uh with all these little shoe
2343.04s: boxes these big kind of big shoe boxes
2346.28s: kind of light off green government like
2349.48s: stuff like that and and so the the
2351.96s: bottom line is and and they had these
2353.56s: little Ties on them you know so and it
2356.16s: was a microfish machine that was there
2358.20s: so you had to open up the box and take
2359.76s: out these little canisters and take the
2361.56s: film and put it in the little microfish
2363.24s: machine real high-tech stuff you know
2366.00s: crank it with your and and so that's how
2368.08s: I found the photographs uh wow so and
2370.84s: but once once I saw the symbols I said
2373.00s: you know I'm I want to get this
2374.64s: absolutely correct so what I did is I
2376.96s: took the little yell yellow pad on I
2379.00s: opened it up to the and it was weird
2382.16s: because I wasn't I I wasn't planning it
2385.12s: in any kind of real but I just opened it
2386.96s: up and I I slid the cardboard uh
2389.68s: underneath the underneath there the
2392.28s: inside of the cardboard and then I
2394.20s: traced exactly cuz I wanted to have the
2396.12s: exact order that they were in the exact
2398.64s: shape that they were in I traced these
2400.76s: and I closed them up and I said okay
2403.04s: look I better get out of here done you
2405.80s: know I I I don't know how long I would
2407.44s: have been allowed to stay in there but
2409.56s: but as soon as I found the photographs
2410.96s: and I traced them I said okay I'm I'm
2412.88s: getting out of here you got what you you
2414.36s: got what you needed so so I put them all
2416.20s: back and I put the little yellow pen on
2418.56s: my arm and I just walked right back out
2420.52s: and I picked up my briefcase and started
2422.16s: going down the hall and one of the guys
2424.04s: goes hey hold it Sheen hold it uh and I
2426.92s: turn I said what have you got there said
2428.96s: I said oh it's my briefcase I just
2430.84s: picked up my briefcase it was just there
2432.76s: and he said no under your what and they
2434.60s: both came over to me you know and they
2436.40s: kind of you know one of them just yanked
2439.28s: the yellow pad and he flipped through
2441.20s: the pages and the course there nothing
2442.44s: on him and so he handed it back to me
2444.48s: like that so wow so so I so I bring it
2449.52s: bring it all back over to to the Jesuit
2451.68s: headquarters and I go to Father Davis
2453.92s: who was my Superior and I showed it to
2456.48s: him said look what look at this I said
2458.52s: and I've got absolute I've seen the
2460.88s: photos of this crash retrieval going on
2463.64s: and that's what he just he just lean
2465.44s: down and he kind of slid open the drawer
2467.20s: on the desk and he takes out this little
2468.72s: 8 1/2 by 11 manila folder with a little
2472.52s: clasp on it and handed it to me and so I

2565.48s: retrieval this this thing had obviously
2569.00s: hit into this field you can tell because
2571.00s: it had plowed This creepy was a yeah it
2573.80s: was a it was a a big disc with the with
2577.32s: the Dome on top it was it was like a
2579.84s: classic flying a glass Dome like no no
2583.00s: it was a metal it was a metal Dome uh
2586.00s: and it was clearly to me like a metal
2588.52s: craft any panels or no seamless no
2591.68s: seamless and there were US Air Force
2593.88s: guys all around it I could see them cuz
2596.48s: and they they had they were taking
2598.08s: photographs of it and one of the guys
2600.44s: actually had a a movie camera and you
2604.24s: you could tell it had those two big
2605.76s: canisters on top of oh the can the big
2608.60s: canister so it's like I don't know in
2610.48s: the 1950s or late 50s whatever that was

2623.52s: worried about it you could tell they
2625.40s: were you could tell they were excited
2626.96s: and they were taking photographs of this
2628.52s: thing so uh so that's what I I saw it
2631.44s: and I knew then do you still have the
2635.04s: that drawing no it's a it's such a
2638.28s: bummer is with the Jesuit files you I I
2640.88s: put in with the Jesuit files and we
2642.44s: brought the Jesuit files with us out to
2645.08s: California when we came there after the
2647.40s: Iran Contra case and we stored them this
2649.80s: is one of those terrible stories sure
2651.96s: that we stored them Riverside uh uh
2655.96s: where we were going to be staying
2657.60s: temporarily and there was one of these
2659.56s: big uh things these big storms that they
2662.20s: have in California whatever they uh yeah
2664.76s: they I don't know they call them
2666.00s: something the fire
2667.88s: no this was a huge rainstorm it rained
2670.80s: for like 12 days in a row and it flooded
2673.56s: out and the people down at the storage
2675.80s: facility actually took it upon
2677.56s: themselves to throw some stuff out we
2679.88s: didn't know exactly what they'd all
2681.36s: thrown out until we all moved to Jackson
2683.48s: Brown's Ranch Jackson Brown invited us
2685.92s: to stay at his Ranch up in uh in h Santa
2689.16s: Barbara and then we were teaching at the
2691.16s: University because we were this was just
2693.68s: after the Iran Contra case and uh and so
2696.40s: that we were teaching all about what we
2698.72s: discovered during the Iran Contra case
2700.12s: and the off the shelf Enterprise all the
2702.16s: assassination programs and everything so
2704.72s: that uh and so they they they tossed it
2707.40s: out I I know I knew what they looked
2709.48s: like and you know I've I've redrawn them
2712.84s: if you don't mind
2714.52s: yeah oh yeah sure yeah here I I'll show
2722.64s: you we interrupt this broadcast to bring
2725.04s: you a brief update the store over at
2727.84s: Area 52 has now been
2730.64s: replenished visit area 52. shop to pick
2733.68s: up your exclusive Area 52 merch
2736.80s: today I'll show you that I don't know if
2739.12s: they can I we'll show it after okay well
2741.52s: here here's here's the uh could you draw
2743.88s: what you saw in the picture yeah here
2745.24s: here's the here's the big Hillside and
2747.44s: here's this field it's over here right
2749.72s: and here's the here's the saucer the
2751.40s: saucer is stuck in the the embankment
2757.80s: like this right see yeah and along the
2762.00s: bottom of the and what I did is I blew
2764.72s: it up with the with the little microfish
2767.28s: machine I could twist a little dial and
2769.48s: get a bigger bigger picture of and so I
2771.48s: could see that all along the bottom
2774.12s: right along the bottom of the disc right
2775.96s: bottom of the Dome the bottom of the
2777.60s: Dome that I could see these symbols that
2780.52s: were there and so were they etched they
2783.88s: were etched they were they were in the
2785.64s: they were in The Craft it looked like
2787.88s: there was there was like a depth to the
2789.52s: symbols well it was it was far away I
2791.92s: mean it was it was far away like this
2793.84s: the photograph that was taken you could
2795.40s: see the guys you could see the little
2797.52s: guys uh you know running around here uh
2800.60s: you know uh these two guys were taking
2803.40s: photographs there was a guy over here
2805.64s: that uh that uh had the had the camera
2808.76s: you know with the two little two little
2810.44s: balls on the top of it and he was taking
2812.92s: pictures of it and they were they were
2814.36s: all around it and it was Winter cuz you
2816.56s: can see all the snow on the ground and
2817.96s: they they had these little you know
2819.40s: fuzzy hoods on you know those little
2822.00s: guys yeah so you could see it and so
2824.44s: when when I saw those symbols I said oh
2826.16s: oh look I'm going to I've got to trace
2828.44s: these exactly so I blew it up uh and
2832.16s: here we'll do this little guy uh we and
2836.24s: so so that you have the you have the
2838.48s: Dome like like this mhm and the big
2842.40s: craft like that right and and so they're
2845.20s: all along here and they they look like
2861.56s: this yeah and and and they and they went
2866.00s: all around the whole 180 degrees that I
2868.88s: could see of it there were a whole
2870.40s: sequence of them like this and that they
2872.96s: were like different different
2874.52s: combinations of these straight lines
2876.68s: like like this point pointing from in
2879.24s: different directions from left to right
2881.28s: and right to left and and then they had
2883.32s: these little dots here and some of them
2885.64s: were like little long lines and others
2887.60s: were these little horseshoe shaped kind
2890.12s: of little U's like that and and they
2892.56s: just repeated like that and they went
2894.12s: all around this looks a little bit um
2896.80s: what Bob
2898.96s: Lazar described on the inside of the
2902.16s: craft he had this panel which went
2905.00s: transparent M and then there these
2907.08s: symbols that appeared well that's what
2908.84s: it was and so I said you know I better
2911.76s: CU I said I figured that what we could
2913.72s: do even though I could only see this
2915.64s: half of them that you know someday we
2917.92s: were going to be able to figure out by
2919.56s: putting them into a computer of some
2921.16s: sort to figure out what what that was uh
2926.08s: so so so I brought it back to the
2929.00s: headquarters that is fascinating I have
2931.64s: seen those symbols I I don't know where
2933.80s: but I've I mean I've got so many books
2935.56s: in these old like they always just come
2937.92s: across my desk in old files you never
2939.56s: know what's real and what isn't and
2941.40s: right but this to me is like is very
2944.20s: credible that's the that's the real deal
2946.92s: what was your feeling when you saw this
2949.72s: because that is for some people that
2952.08s: would be enough for them to lose their
2953.68s: minds well no what what it was was that
2956.04s: I'd always assumed that there you know
2959.76s: ever ever since I was really little and
2961.92s: I first got to be outdoors at night when
2964.88s: the stars would come out and when I
2966.84s: realized what stars were that they were
2969.36s: like Suns of uh with planets I obviously
2974.04s: they must have planets going around
2975.44s: because if they're like Suns like ours
2977.36s: you know they must have these planets
2978.68s: and there's people probably on them you
2981.00s: know and and I never thought much about
2982.80s: what the people would be like I just
2985.08s: said I thought it was fascinating the
2987.24s: perspective of being down here like
2989.60s: sitting in the grass in my yard and
2991.48s: looking up and seeing these stars and
2993.00s: say look at how weird it is of all of
2995.32s: what we're doing down here running
2996.84s: around not even paying attention to that
2999.92s: you know uh in the in not of that but
3002.28s: doing these weird things to each other
3004.76s: you know without taking into account you
3007.40s: know the kind of perspective that this
3010.28s: really brought to us uh and so I'd
3012.36s: always been confident was true then when
3014.48s: I I guess the the Betty and Barney Hill
3017.44s: thing I I was really fascinated by that
3019.40s: and got a copy of that incident of exor
3021.92s: and and Reddit Fuller thing and and I
3025.16s: was always kind of keeping track of of
3027.96s: all of this and that that I would always
3031.00s: uh when whenever I was out uh at night I
3034.16s: would always kind of take time to pull
3037.16s: step aside and just stop and look up at
3039.92s: the stars and pick pick out a a
3042.24s: particular star and and just were I I
3045.76s: realized when I was young that the Stars
3047.96s: pulse you know in the planets don't you
3050.84s: know the planets just are just a beam of
3052.56s: light like that it's how I could tell
3053.88s: the difference I would pick out one star
3056.44s: and and it was just sort of pulsing and
3058.28s: I always kind of had the sense of like
3060.28s: maybe maybe that's like Morse code or
3062.56s: something maybe they're kind of sending
3064.40s: little little messages to us and we just
3067.04s: don't haven't kind of figured out how to
3068.96s: interpret those things yet uh uh and so
3071.84s: so the bottom line is I'd always been
3074.04s: that way and so when when I saw this
3077.28s: when I when I saw this thing I looked at
3079.24s: I my feeling was just like yeah there it
3081.40s: is you know there it is there's one of
3083.68s: them right there you know and and i' i'
3085.84s: seen I almost any photograph or anything
3088.24s: that I've ever seen that was purported
3090.12s: to be one I would find it look at it and
3092.48s: say w how are we doing on getting these
3094.40s: things identify so when I saw this thing
3097.12s: and I said yeah that's that's one of
3099.08s: them right there and so but it was the
3101.56s: first time I'd seen symbols like that I
3103.80s: mean it's it's something to see it in
3106.84s: the setting that you saw it into I think
3108.96s: that that makes it yeah you know much
3111.40s: more important as a you know it's
3113.88s: official exactly this this was official
3116.08s: these these were the files this isn't in
3117.92s: some obscure magazine or or you know
3121.00s: these were the the the classified Blue
3123.76s: Book stuff that they brought and so this
3127.16s: is one of the first things that that I
3129.16s: that I told um uh what's this head at
3132.64s: the uh uh in the U Arrow office that uh
3138.12s: uh what's his name Sean Sean kpatrick
3140.48s: yeah that's the first thing I told him I
3142.64s: said you know I've seen it you know I I
3144.64s: saw them direct and this was a crash
3146.64s: retrieval I said you know so there's
3149.24s: there's a a direct not exactly
3152.32s: eyewitness but but there's also video
3154.28s: apparently I said I said they've got to
3155.96s: have the photographs and videos and and
3158.00s: they got to have the records of having
3159.20s: brought them to Washington that's right
3161.00s: they've got to have those records and so
3163.08s: there's there's four guys because I saw
3165.24s: the two guys at the front door and the
3166.60s: two guys downstairs so there's there's
3168.52s: records there you know they they'll have
3170.16s: all their their reports so those are all
3173.28s: there you know so so when he when he you
3176.08s: know published this thing saying they
3178.00s: had no evidence of any sort had no one
3179.92s: had ever given them any information or
3181.48s: evidence you know and I told them all
3183.32s: about Clifford Stone all about my
3185.36s: interviewing Clifford Stone you know for
3187.36s: the disclosure project uh and and said
3190.40s: look get get all of his records find out
3192.24s: what his was so I I laid the stuff out
3195.08s: in detail to them you know that's
3198.24s: remarkable yeah it's remarkable that
3201.28s: it's so close yet so far yeah you know
3204.32s: it's like right under their noses and
3206.20s: yet
3207.04s: well it we acting like we're looking in
3208.84s: space and at the bottom of the ocean and
3210.48s: it's like hey it's in a shoe box
3211.80s: somewhere under your feet well the thing
3214.36s: that was we about it is that that uh
3216.28s: that father Davis was so impressed by
3218.56s: this that what he did is he talked to
3220.44s: the other people at Jesuit headquarters
3222.24s: and we got permission to go to the
3224.88s: Washington interreligious staff Council
3228.44s: uh in Washington DC that had
3231.00s: representatives of the the major 54
3234.16s: major religious denominations in the
3236.44s: United States and made an official
3238.64s: presentation to them about this asking
3241.16s: them to put a put together a task force
3244.44s: uh so that we could start getting all
3245.96s: the churches and synagogues and stuff
3247.88s: together in temples to come to grips
3250.24s: with this thing uh I remember Judy Stone
3252.80s: was the was the head of that at the time
3255.00s: and uh and she she kind of stared around
3257.76s: the room she said well are there any
3260.24s: other suggestions you
3263.24s: know they just were not going anywhere
3265.44s: near this but the but the Jesuits were
3268.00s: all supportive of trying to get them to
3270.36s: very intellectual the Jesuits though
3271.88s: they're all very intelligent you know
3274.84s: there's that uh yeah that they're able
3277.84s: to perhaps fit that into their ontology
3280.72s: sure whereas it's much harder for I
3282.56s: think some other well they're they're
3283.76s: smart enough to to alter their ontology
3286.44s: take it into account once they've got it
3288.60s: you know do that's that's their job is
3291.16s: to reform the Church um you know
3294.44s: speaking of Jesuits and religion and
3298.72s: uaps I mean there's also you know this
3302.44s: this connection between uh not only
3306.64s: Scientology and the UAP subject but also
3309.76s: uh Mormon yes um connection as well um
3313.60s: in intelligence specifically you know
3316.04s: and um we can get into each of those
3318.52s: separately but i' I'd like to start with
3320.60s: the um with the Mormon Stu something we
3323.32s: didn't talk about last night either but
3324.88s: I thought it was really interesting
3326.68s: because obviously you have Doug way
3327.96s: that's out there which is Area 52 which
3330.20s: is like you know seems to be one of the
3332.68s: most interesting places um you know uh
3335.92s: save S4
3337.76s: perhaps but you also have BYU that's
3341.64s: there you've got all this sort of um you
3345.12s: know and and and there's a long history
3347.44s: of there was even uh there was even a
3349.28s: civil case against the FBI for um uh I
3354.80s: think it was discrimination because they
3356.72s: were only hiring Mormons at one point
3358.80s: yeah they were pretty close they were
3361.32s: pretty close I I actually did a case on
3364.00s: that that really yeah there was a a
3367.12s: Mormon guy who had uh uh he'd been
3371.92s: approached by the FBI no he he was
3374.56s: approached by the CIA actually to plant
3378.64s: false uh intelligence information with
3381.88s: Russians some Russians had approached
3383.96s: him for some I don't know exactly what
3386.64s: he was doing but he got approached and
3388.56s: so the CIA approached him to to Salt in
3391.96s: false information so they could track
3394.32s: where that false information went and
3396.44s: they could figure out the chain uh and
3398.60s: so and then it turns out someone
3401.20s: reported him to the FBI and the FBI
3404.04s: arrested him all right uh and he went to
3407.36s: his local Bishop uh in the Mormon church
3410.72s: and told him all about this and it was
3413.64s: the Mormon Bishop that turned on him wow
3418.00s: uh and and actually is the guy who
3420.12s: contacted the FBI on him Wow when he
3422.32s: told him about it and so uh I got I got
3425.00s: contacted by the some of the hierarchy
3427.16s: in the the Mormon church because I had
3429.44s: done the cases I did the case for the
3432.48s: Church of Scientology people who got
3434.80s: subpoenaed uh in New York to be dragged
3438.16s: into a grand jury up in New York uh and
3441.24s: I was upset about the fact that they
3444.00s: were that the justice department was
3445.72s: trying to compel them to reveal
3447.60s: information about the internal workings
3449.36s: of the church and so I went up and did
3452.52s: the case to quash that that
3455.52s: subpoena uh and uh that's why I got
3458.80s: asked eventually to be the lawyer for
3460.80s: elron hubard and his wife Susan um
3464.48s: anyway long story we'll get into that
3466.40s: after yeah but but so so so the the bot
3468.64s: put pin there yeah yeah but but the
3470.36s: bottom line is I so I had done that case
3472.92s: and so that they contacted me to say
3475.16s: look at can't you make some kind of an
3476.96s: argument that that was a violation uh of
3479.72s: his priest penitent kind of uh
3482.76s: confessional relationship with his
3484.44s: bishop and that the FBI didn't have any
3486.76s: right to do that uh well what I did
3490.32s: instead is I brought in a a fellow who
3493.80s: I'd also been approached by a fellow Ron
3496.96s: rewald Ron rewald was a CIA guy who
3500.68s: actually ran a hello hello phone base
3503.80s: for the agency out of Hawaii that uh
3506.96s: pretended to be a private investment
3508.76s: firm and CIA guys would be given
3511.28s: credentials at being agents for his
3513.56s: investment firm and they were running
3515.28s: around all over Asia spying you know uh
3518.88s: and uh funny story his brother his
3522.76s: brother comes walking into my office at
3524.68s: Jesuit headquarters pleading with me to
3526.92s: do something to help him because he'd
3528.84s: been arrested uh out in Hawaii and and
3531.96s: what had happened is that this hello
3533.92s: phone operation had been set up by the
3535.72s: agents
3537.08s: as a front for giving credentials false
3540.08s: credentials to these alleged investment
3542.96s: agents that he worked with ran around
3545.04s: spying on people in Asia and uh and what
3548.40s: happened is he only had six uh investors
3551.84s: in his investment firm and one of them
3554.04s: was the head of six-pack the six Fleet
3556.20s: the Admiral one of them was the head of
3557.56s: the CIA in in Hawaii another one was one
3560.40s: of the major generals there and FBI he
3562.92s: he he had these kind of select group of
3565.60s: hand Pi government officials that he was
3569.56s: benefiting by having this private
3571.80s: investment firm as the front for these
3574.16s: other guys uh and and it turns out that
3577.40s: he gets contacted by the agency and they
3579.52s: said you know this is not good to have
3582.12s: just these guys this is kind of
3583.40s: suspicious you know that you got you
3584.80s: ought to have more investors in this so
3587.24s: he ends up putting an ad in the
3589.20s: newspaper in a Honolulu newspaper
3592.64s: advertising his private investment firm
3595.00s: guaranteeing you one 100% return on your
3597.56s: money every year annually right uh in
3600.40s: the head of the Bunko
3602.16s: Squad a police department someone
3604.76s: reports this to him look at what and so
3607.12s: he drives up to this guy's estate this
3609.04s: Ron rewald say here these Arabian horses
3611.80s: racing you know in in Lamborghini sports
3614.96s: cars all whatever and so he says this
3616.92s: guy's a total fraud and he arrested him
3619.76s: uh and brings him down and puts him in
3621.24s: The Slammer down and so he's freaking
3623.48s: out around reall trying to tell him say
3625.12s: look at I can't tell you this but you
3626.92s: know I I work for the agency that this
3628.88s: is a an operation you need to contact
3631.28s: and of course the agency denied no
3632.76s: anything of course and so he's freaking
3634.92s: out and he calls his brother to come to
3637.16s: Hawaii to help him so his brother gets
3639.64s: briefs in on this and he comes to me at
3641.44s: Jesuit headquarters I don't know why
3643.00s: exactly but anyway he ended up coming to
3644.92s: me uh and and I said look at I don't
3648.48s: necessarily believe your brother or you
3650.84s: you know that he's really running a
3653.00s: legit hello uh phone place for the
3655.52s: agency you're going to have to bring me
3657.04s: some kind of documentation of this so he
3659.00s: goes back and talks to his brother and
3661.92s: and he tells him to these documents are
3664.32s: and he brings them back to me and here
3665.68s: they are they're copies of the the
3667.68s: Japanese blueprints for the bullet train
3670.28s: that they' heisted somewhere uh also all
3672.84s: the stuff about Bo GES you know going
3675.08s: into LA and Cambodia looking for our PS
3678.20s: and it was all run by the agency you
3680.20s: know and so I said oh well this is the
3682.80s: real deal and so I started uh doing
3685.92s: something to try to help him and I
3687.80s: realized that when I got contacted by
3690.56s: this uh the Mormon some of the Mormon
3693.20s: leadership because I was at Jesuit
3694.88s: headquarters right uh and uh and uh so I
3698.60s: said oh what I can do is have this guy
3700.76s: Ron reall flown in to the eastern
3703.44s: district of Virginia which is the CIA
3706.60s: Court the federal district court for the
3708.84s: eastern district is everybody knows it's
3710.64s: the agency that kind of runs it uh and
3713.28s: so I'd have him flown in and have him
3715.44s: testify on behalf of the Mormon guy that
3718.24s: you know that they did the same thing to
3721.12s: him that he was a full agency guy and
3723.28s: they lied and wouldn't acknowledge it he
3724.88s: was there and so that there was credible
3727.00s: it was credible evidence to support the
3728.96s: fact that what this other guy was saying
3730.32s: was true and so incomes around rewal and
3734.04s: uh and the two two you assistant us
3737.32s: attorneys show up opposing my being able
3740.16s: to present him uh asserting that it
3742.96s: would reveal National Security
3744.48s: information and so the judge said oh so
3746.76s: that you're acknowledging then that Mr
3748.76s: is and they said no no we're we're not
3750.44s: acknowledging that he he really is a CIA
3752.96s: person but but we're asserting National
3755.40s: Security you can't Mr shean can't talk
3757.48s: to him he doesn't have an adequate
3759.04s: security clearance and so the judge says
3760.96s: to me Mr sh what kind of a security
3762.96s: clearance would you like and I said a q
3765.84s: clearance you're I'll take a q clearance
3767.80s: and he said good you have it you know he
3769.40s: so I got issue a c clearance by the
3771.36s: Eastern sister not that not that would
3774.16s: have held up anywh this what I got the
3776.36s: got to talk with him at Great length
3778.60s: about all the stuff that that they were
3780.04s: doing yeah and that's how I got to meet
3781.72s: Bo GES you know who was running Bo was
3785.04s: running those those p uh field but
3788.96s: that's I guess how you found out that
3790.96s: there was a long tie between recruiting
3794.64s: oh yes Mormons that's right you know
3796.48s: part of that goes into their specific
3799.60s: belief system as well allows for life on
3802.28s: other planets yes it does not
3804.20s: necessarily non because that's how it
3806.52s: started I mean that that that's how the
3808.24s: Mormon Church started was these these
3810.24s: beings of light Yes actually presenting
3813.04s: Joseph Smith with these plaques these
3815.92s: these plates that had all these these
3818.72s: writing and stuff on them yeah that the
3820.88s: and and that said that there was they
3822.32s: were seeding life on these other planets
3825.16s: um human life yeah um so you know
3828.40s: already in their own religious belief
3830.72s: they're already inclined to expand their
3834.64s: Universal or Galactic awareness uh into
3838.48s: other beings secondly they don't smoke
3842.32s: they don't drink they don't swear
3844.44s: they're all ready for the FBI they don't
3845.72s: drink caffeine yeah they don't party
3848.24s: they're all ready for the FBI yeah and
3850.16s: lastly uh collateral they have large
3853.60s: families yes and so you look at this and
3856.68s: you're like and I mean you know also
3860.88s: ethnically speaking they're all white
3862.60s: guys and that's like it's also also the
3865.28s: FBI is very happy with exactly crew cuts
3868.92s: they also have crew cuts exactly all
3870.20s: three letter agencies I would I would
3871.88s: say well FBI especially specifically FBI
3875.24s: you can tell a FB you know across the
3877.32s: street right you know they fit the bill
3880.48s: you know yeah yeah yeah yeah they do so
3883.08s: you know because because I've heard um
3885.76s: through reports that I've read that
3887.12s: there was like active recruiting at BYU
3889.56s: and and that the funnel to go into these
3891.92s: three-letter agencies was quite direct
3894.56s: like it was pretty like you apply your
3897.52s: in well so it's like Yale with the
3899.52s: agency yeah you know the yeles lean in
3902.52s: heavy on on the agency they tried some
3904.96s: of the recruiting at Harvard it didn't
3906.52s: work as well you but uh but Yale is very
3909.68s: responsive Skull and Bones especially
3912.00s: they're pre- selected you know yeah so
3914.88s: that's that's really interesting um when
3916.76s: you can have trustworthy people like
3918.60s: that work in those capacities around
3921.20s: these secret you know deep underground
3922.92s: military bases and makes it really
3925.72s: interesting now uh transitioning into
3928.68s: Scientology you'd mentioned quickly and
3932.12s: passing that you were offered to
3935.44s: represent elron Hubbert yes now that's
3939.92s: quite the
3940.84s: opportunity well it's it's interesting
3943.60s: that the the way that it happened is
3945.80s: that that when when when I came to
3948.00s: Jesuit headquarters that they they came
3950.20s: up to Harvard div school to ask me to
3952.52s: come down to uh to Washington to be
3955.76s: legal counsel for the Jesuits uh and uh
3960.12s: I had I had uh when I arrived one of the
3964.16s: first things I did is I went over and
3965.76s: saw Bob dryan uh Bob father Bob dryan
3968.68s: was a Jesuit priest who was the
3970.72s: congressman from Brookline uh outside of
3973.08s: Boston then he was the chairman of the
3975.80s: house Judiciary
3977.32s: Committee so I had to go over to see him
3979.64s: another thing we were opposing Senate
3981.36s: bill one which was this big Senate bill
3983.48s: that was uh prepared by Richard Nixon
3987.28s: just after he came in and he'd had
3989.36s: ranquist as a Special Assistant Attorney
3991.56s: General redraft the entire Federal
3993.88s: criminal code into this kind of totally
3996.40s: reactionary hardcore it's sort of like
3999.32s: you know project 2025 you know for the
4002.36s: back then but to redraft the entire
4004.48s: Federal criminal code and so we were
4006.84s: opposing that and we' helped organize
4009.00s: this Coalition of uh of 81 different
4012.20s: Federal organizations citizens groups to
4014.96s: oppose it so I went over to see Bob
4017.84s: dryan uh as the head of the Judiciary
4020.00s: Committee to get them to bottle up the
4022.56s: Senate bill and on the house side and
4024.20s: just not let it even go to the floor
4026.04s: right uh and so when I was there talking
4027.96s: to I was saying you know why is it that
4030.08s: you know down here in Washington you
4031.40s: know you got the uh you know you got uh
4034.12s: green piece for all the
4035.16s: environmentalists you got the National
4036.60s: Organization for Women you got ACL why
4039.20s: don't the churches you know have some
4041.56s: kind of organization Collective
4043.20s: Organization for dealing with public
4045.12s: policy
4046.20s: you know we've got some basic values you
4048.36s: know human rights values Etc and he said
4051.20s: oh well you know that they're afraid of
4053.72s: the church and state you know blending
4055.44s: together and I said well the
4056.60s: fundamentalists aren't paying any
4058.16s: attention to that you know why aren't
4059.48s: the Liberals and progressives doing
4060.92s: anything said well you know that they're
4063.04s: really leery about the Catholic church
4065.52s: because of the long history of the
4066.84s: Catholic Church dominating in all of
4068.80s: Western Civilization for a thousand
4070.80s: years you know uh and especially the
4073.32s: Jesuits uh and so I said well look at me
4075.96s: try to reach out to some of the folks uh
4078.64s: to see if we can get past that and so I
4081.20s: did I went and met with the rabbi David
4083.60s: sapin the union of American Hebrew
4085.72s: Congregation I met with Joe Elders over
4087.40s: at the methodists and met with Bob elper
4089.60s: over at the unitarians I I went around
4091.24s: to actually meet the people and so we
4093.52s: organized a thing called the Washington
4095.64s: interreligious staff Council and we put
4099.20s: together this group that would meet once
4101.88s: a month and we would discuss all the
4103.88s: different public policy issues that were
4105.56s: going on and we' put together task
4107.88s: forces we put uh together a task force
4111.00s: on nuclear disarmament a task force on
4113.84s: more just economics you know we had
4115.72s: these task forces and one of them was
4117.68s: the task force on human rights uh and
4120.28s: criminal justice and I chaired that
4122.92s: right for the country uh and so that
4126.20s: that one of the things I did is I wanted
4127.76s: to have Consultants come in like ACLU
4130.92s: and some others to be able to be in our
4132.88s: meetings so we could talk with them and
4134.96s: uh all of a sudden I don't know about
4136.72s: the third or fourth of these monthly
4138.20s: meetings that we gotten organized this
4140.72s: young couple shows up and says that
4142.72s: they're from the uh the the the uh
4146.28s: Institute for human rights I was going
4148.76s: Institute for human rights I've never
4150.08s: even heard of that at all you know but
4151.92s: they were extremely well-dressed and
4153.40s: very polite and everything and and and
4156.16s: they started advocating that we do
4158.12s: something about Psychiatry and
4160.12s: psychiatrists that they were you know
4162.04s: the bane of our existence and we got to
4164.08s: do something about making illegal and
4166.68s: you know and I said this kind of a weird
4169.20s: topic uh and I checked out and it turns
4171.80s: out that the Church of Scientology was
4174.40s: deep into uh opposing
4177.24s: psychiatrists uh and uh and so uh the
4180.76s: next time the kids the couple came over
4183.24s: I pulled them aside and I said you guys
4185.00s: are scientologists right and they were
4187.60s: going uh well no I mean individually but
4191.44s: you know not that's not why I said you
4193.20s: you don't have to do that to me I said
4195.12s: you know I'm very open-minded and you
4197.96s: guys are recognized by the IRS as a
4200.24s: church it's you know okay with me
4202.96s: besides you know I have just Consulting
4204.60s: groups so they were totally delighted
4206.64s: that I was tolerant you weren't
4208.20s: judgmental no no so they were very happy
4210.24s: about it uh and so they they came and
4212.76s: then a couple months later they asked to
4215.40s: apply to become members of the
4217.40s: Washington in religious staff uh Council
4219.56s: as a church and I said now that's a
4221.60s: little more formal so I went and talked
4223.08s: to Jim Hamilton who was the head of the
4224.80s: national Council of churches and he said
4226.52s: absolutely not you know we're not we're
4228.60s: not going to allow them in I said well
4230.76s: that's kind of a strange position to
4232.28s: take you know you're just kind of asking
4234.28s: them out have you done any research or
4236.08s: anything on them and they said no but we
4237.88s: know you know that they're having a
4239.20s: whole bad thing with the IRS IRS is
4241.64s: trying to take away their tax exemption
4244.00s: I said well the I'm I'm going to just
4246.80s: let them stay as a consultant to our
4249.16s: thing so they were very happy and then
4252.56s: uh I don't know couple months later into
4254.80s: the process
4255.88s: you know I'm getting set to go out of
4257.64s: town this one one Friday morning uh and
4262.04s: uh I stopped to the phone booth because
4264.56s: we didn't have cell phones back then
4266.44s: it's I'm I'm older than I look yeah so
4269.72s: so I didn't have cell phones we're we're
4272.64s: good okay but you didn't have I I would
4274.60s: didn't have television okay anyway so
4277.76s: the the bottom line is so I I call into
4280.64s: the the headquarters and I say is there
4282.00s: anything going on that I need to do
4283.20s: before and Bill David Father David oh
4285.60s: ABS I'm so glad he said the Church of
4287.80s: Scientology people have been calling the
4289.28s: phones off the hooks all morning you
4291.08s: know the the the FBI has shown up at
4293.52s: their place and they've chainsawed off
4295.28s: their doors uh and they it turns out the
4299.08s: FBI showed up uh chainsawed the doors
4301.68s: off the headquarters in Washington and
4303.68s: contemporaneously saw the doors off the
4306.32s: headquarters in Los Angeles at the same
4308.28s: time uh you know and and uh I drove over
4311.72s: there uh and here's this big mass arrest
4314.72s: wagon you you know with all antennas on
4316.88s: and they've got people in and they were
4318.60s: rolling they had rolled these uh uh
4321.36s: Xerox machines into the headquarters and
4323.84s: they were xeroxing every piece of paper
4325.52s: in the entire place right and so I said
4328.08s: to I said to the the guardian or the
4330.24s: legal council for the Guardians office I
4332.28s: said you know is there a warrant here
4334.20s: somewhere and he said well that's the
4335.68s: guy over there he's got the warrant so I
4336.96s: go over and I confronted the guy you get
4339.12s: a look at the warrant you know and the
4340.68s: warrant said you know that they're
4342.44s: looking for any evidence of electronic
4345.20s: listening devices and they go down
4346.44s: through this whole thing and they get
4347.36s: all the way to the bottom of the thing
4348.48s: say and any evidence of any other
4351.08s: potential violation of federal or state
4353.00s: law I mean it was an absolute General
4355.72s: warrant I mean you couldn't have drafted
4358.00s: a more you know illegal
4360.24s: UNC overb anything you can find right so
4363.80s: I went over immediately over to judge
4365.20s: green over in the federal district court
4367.32s: because I was admitted there and got a
4369.48s: restraining order against them and
4371.08s: struck down the warrant uh and came
4374.04s: right back and and delivered it to the
4376.16s: people and I got to write the actual
4378.44s: order for the judge uh and it was
4380.76s: demanding that they return all
4382.00s: fingerprints off documents any Xerox
4383.96s: copies you know any any photographs
4386.32s: they' taken inside the facility you know
4387.84s: it was just completely thorough so it
4389.96s: just extracted every last thing out of
4392.48s: the hands of the Feds that had come in
4394.80s: uh and so that they were ecstatic there
4397.12s: the at the church of Scientology right
4400.16s: and and it was just two weeks later that
4402.16s: the subpoenas were issued up in New York
4404.44s: for the top 20 leaders of the Church of
4406.60s: Scientology to come to a grand jury and
4409.20s: I was totally offended at the fact that
4410.84s: they were doing that so I went up and
4412.72s: struck down that one too you know just
4415.52s: as an ancillary thing and and so that's
4418.36s: when uh I got these guys showed up at my
4420.68s: office Jesuit headquarters saying that
4422.56s: you know uh Elon hubard would like you
4425.32s: to consider becoming a lawyer the lawyer
4427.68s: for him and his wife Susan and I said uh
4431.56s: well no I said is a a condition
4434.60s: proceeding from even being willing to go
4437.20s: meet with him you know I'd have to be
4439.00s: given access to every single document
4442.52s: anywhere in the world of the Church of
4444.48s: Scientology to be able to review ahead
4446.24s: of time uh you know and I fig that's
4449.36s: just not that's a non-starter right two
4452.00s: weeks later they come back and said it's
4453.36s: a deal you know that's uh around wants
4456.40s: you to be the lawyer and so that they
4458.44s: fly me down to the blue cube down in uh
4461.12s: in uh where was it in Florida uh anyway
4465.32s: that they fly they fly me down there so
4467.96s: I I get a hold of Bill Taylor uh who was
4470.36s: my investigator at Lee Bailey's office
4473.24s: and he's the president of the Florida
4475.04s: Association of professional private
4476.64s: investigators so I bring him with me and
4478.84s: we we go to the the blue cube down there
4481.48s: in in Florida so we go in and I we come
4484.40s: into this they bring up in this big room
4486.28s: and one of them is the head of the
4487.88s: Guardians office for the Church of
4489.28s: Scientology for the country and they had
4491.44s: the international guardian of the Church
4495.28s: of Scientology worldwide sitting there
4497.24s: at the table and so he says to me uh
4499.96s: what's uh what's the uh first thing that
4503.00s: that you'd like to see and I said uh I'd
4506.20s: like I I think I told you this the other
4508.08s: night I said I said I'd like to see the
4509.88s: file that you got on me uh in the the
4512.76s: other guy from the US I said no no we
4514.76s: don't we've got we wouldn't and I said
4517.04s: excuse me I said well look I fell off
4519.52s: some melon wagon somewhere coming out of
4521.12s: the country I said you know that if if
4523.16s: you ask me to be the lawyer for Ron h
4525.00s: you don't have any file on me and the
4526.80s: guy said turn the international guy says
4528.56s: go get him the file so he goes and
4530.36s: brings me the file so I I leave through
4533.20s: the whole thing look I'm showing it to
4534.56s: Bill Taylor and you know he got pictures
4536.20s: of me in restaurants and meetings and
4538.52s: different things recent pictures or yeah
4541.24s: yeah they were staking you out yeah yeah
4543.08s: had pictures of you know the blue flame
4544.68s: that we drove father D Davis's little
4546.84s: Ford Falcon we had the license plates on
4549.76s: it and all that so then I said okay I
4551.96s: just wanted to make sure it was accurate
4554.08s: you know and and so then the
4556.32s: international Guardian said so what what
4558.44s: is it you want to see now and I said I
4560.68s: want to see the the three most sensitive
4563.68s: documents anywhere in the world uh
4567.44s: according to your opinion as the head
4569.64s: guardian and he went oh oh no yeah
4573.60s: he said that he did he said uh and so he
4577.64s: went off to get him but he could have
4579.00s: showed you anything yeah he could have
4580.76s: he could have but on the other hand then
4582.56s: I wouldn't have even considered being
4584.36s: the lawyer yeah so so that's how that's
4586.40s: how I got shown the uh the first the
4590.64s: first ones it was it was all about it
4592.72s: all Ingo Swan's reports Ingo Ingo was a
4595.44s: high level clear of District of
4597.04s: Scientology and he was one of the main
4599.56s: remote viewers uh in the remote viewing
4602.28s: program with hell put off star yeah hell
4606.72s: put off and uh and uh Russ Russ tar and
4610.80s: so that so they had all the reports
4613.04s: there and it turns out that inos was
4615.12s: filing reports with the Guardians office
4617.24s: on this top secret you Office of Naval
4619.84s: intelligence operation they had going on
4621.92s: of the remote viewing because they were
4624.24s: trying to figure out how to communicate
4625.80s: with our nuclear submarines so because
4628.28s: the submarines would have to come to the
4629.68s: surface and put up an antenna the
4631.48s: Heavenly communication and then they get
4633.20s: picked up by the Russian satellites wow
4635.00s: so that was the goal there that was how
4636.44s: it started yeah that's right what they
4638.64s: had done what they had done I saw in the
4641.84s: F they had they had uh uh
4645.40s: gotten this mother rabbit uh in her
4647.76s: litter and they had taken the mother
4650.08s: rabbit and they had her there in
4652.40s: Connecticut at one of the big Naval
4654.08s: bases there uh and uh in this little
4656.68s: cage and they hooked her all up to these
4658.44s: electrograms electrocardiograms and
4660.52s: everything and they took the little
4662.28s: members of their litter and they put
4663.72s: them in these different nuclear
4665.60s: submarines around the world uh and then
4669.04s: at a absolute designated second you know
4672.52s: on these like atomic clocks they would
4675.40s: start torturing one of the little babies
4678.32s: uh and
4680.08s: instantaneously the brain waves and the
4682.60s: mother would start freaking out uh and
4685.60s: going all off the thing and she start
4687.12s: banging around Inside the Cage trying to
4688.96s: figure out what to do to how to get to
4690.32s: go and so they realized that there was
4692.64s: some something that was going on here
4695.76s: that enabled the the baby rabbit and the
4698.60s: mother to have this kind of
4699.84s: communication that was like
4701.52s: instantaneous W and so that that's how
4703.92s: they started that's how that's how the
4705.56s: program started uh of saying look
4707.64s: there's something going on there's some
4709.16s: phenomenon here uh pursuant to which
4711.88s: these mammals can do this uh and so
4714.88s: that's how the thing started and it was
4717.36s: all in the files survival again yeah
4719.72s: yeah and so I started looking through
4721.68s: the stuff and then uh Ingo Swan uh was
4724.96s: filing these reports uh and they they
4727.32s: filed this report about this one fellow
4729.76s: named Pat price uh who was there and
4733.08s: they went had the details of this uh uh
4736.12s: challenge that they gave to him to to
4738.68s: try to uh promote view a particular
4741.36s: place uh in in real time uh and he did
4746.32s: and he said uh okay I can see where
4749.20s: where the place is here they gave him
4750.96s: the longitude and latitude right and so
4753.16s: he started saying it's a some kind of a
4755.76s: facility it's got like a big fence with
4758.40s: razor wire at the top of it and this big
4760.56s: kind of no man's land around it and and
4763.96s: uh and Russ tar was kind of processing
4767.24s: him through this thing he said okay can
4769.28s: you uh can you go on the other side of
4771.24s: the fence can you see can you get over
4773.00s: to the other side of the fence and he
4774.20s: said okay okay okay I'm over on the
4777.44s: other side of the fence now he said can
4779.76s: you go up to the front door of the place
4781.72s: and said okay I can yeah I can see over
4784.56s: I see over there okay I'm in front of
4786.52s: the door he said can you go through the
4788.72s: door and he said uh okay yeah I can see
4792.28s: what's on the other side of the door I
4793.44s: can go over to the other side of the
4794.44s: door
4795.20s: and they said what do you see he said I
4796.48s: can see this big Hall uh and there's
4798.68s: these three doors on the right and two
4800.44s: doors on the left and he said okay now
4802.44s: go down to the center door on the left
4805.00s: uh he said okay I'm down there by the
4807.00s: door I says can you see what's inside
4809.08s: the room he said okay yeah there's this
4811.80s: big table and desk and stuff and there's
4813.44s: big file cabinet in the right corner
4816.04s: they said okay go over to the file
4817.64s: cabinet uh now second drawer uh the
4821.44s: first file can you read what's in the
4823.76s: file and he read off to them what was in
4826.48s: the file and it turns out this was a
4828.92s: highly secret CIA base uh out there
4832.32s: around Washington and so they could
4834.36s: confirm that he had AC accurately read
4837.72s: the content of the file wow okay and
4841.32s: that's this is this is there right in
4844.24s: the file in front of me uh and so I'm
4846.40s: saying wow that's something uh and uh
4850.52s: and I said and the pat price was so good
4853.08s: that what they could do then is they
4854.92s: could just show him the photograph of a
4859.84s: uh uh a boomer class Russian nuclear
4863.44s: submarine mhm and then he could find
4867.44s: it right down to the the minute and
4870.72s: second uh longitude and latitude of
4873.24s: where it was and the depth where it was
4874.72s: in the ocean yeah uh and he did it and
4878.00s: the first time that he did it and
4879.52s: located this this gu there was a
4882.96s: UFO hovering right over the top of where
4885.92s: the where the the submarine was and
4887.84s: following it around and it was there it
4890.64s: was there in the file uh and he remove
4893.76s: viewed the UFO yeah yeah and uh and so
4897.44s: it was all there uh and uh and so that
4901.48s: then I I started talking later with with
4904.16s: the guy but then they showed me another
4906.00s: file that uh showed this thing uh that I
4910.20s: told you about that uh made me not I
4912.84s: said I'm not going to have anything to
4913.60s: do with this and I just refused to to
4916.24s: work with them anymore but they tried to
4917.84s: talk me into doing it still there was
4920.08s: the other thing with the radar that the
4923.56s: just not it's the uh the uh it wasn't
4927.24s: radar it was a it was a thing that Pat
4929.92s: price did it was a center in Canada it
4933.44s: was in south central Canada just across
4936.76s: the border uh north of the Peninsula
4940.28s: Michigan and it was this little it was
4942.72s: like a little little
4945.32s: Observatory the little Dome building uh
4948.08s: and it had these big antenna on top of
4950.16s: it these radar these dishes these
4953.00s: broadcast dishes uh and they brought Pat
4955.96s: price there and they put this helmet on
4958.64s: him uh in this chair and they put this
4960.96s: helmet on him uh and had him just
4964.12s: concentrate on sending this message out
4967.84s: telepathically uh and then they turned
4970.20s: the the little uh antenna or the domes
4974.04s: or the
4975.36s: dishes down onto the peninsula of uh of
4979.56s: uh pennsylv of Michigan and he kept
4982.80s: broadcasting sing here file your next
4985.92s: federal income tax forms in this little
4990.24s: post office box in this little tiny town
4992.64s: in West Virginia and like 80% of all the
4996.16s: people did
4997.80s: it and so that they've got this capacity
5001.64s: they've got that capacity that's mind
5003.20s: control yeah that that's that's not it's
5005.36s: mind control on a massive scale yeah
5007.20s: it's yeah massive massive scale it's
5009.00s: like a neural linguistic programming
5010.84s: like but for for like a whole slew of
5013.48s: people all at one time but it's not even
5015.84s: linguistic no it's just neural
5017.92s: programming neural programming uh and uh
5020.60s: and so the so I uh uh when I saw the
5024.16s: third program they had that I refused to
5026.72s: participate with you so I ended up that
5029.40s: uh that the the fellow who's still legal
5031.76s: counsel mhm main legal counsel for the
5034.00s: Church of Scientology was there uh and
5036.36s: they were trying to talk me into it I
5038.00s: kept asking more questions about and
5040.24s: what it was is that that the Church of
5042.80s: Scientology believes that the that
5046.72s: there's a major confrontation going on
5049.72s: between
5051.32s: reptilian uh uh extraterrestrial species
5055.28s: from Zeta reticuli uh and the uh uh the
5060.52s: people from the
5061.92s: plees uh and that the plees of the good
5064.72s: guys that look just like us they're like
5066.36s: Homo sapiens they're these reptilians
5068.92s: and the reptilians are trying to take
5070.48s: over our planet uh and that they've
5072.80s: struck a deal with an element inside our
5076.04s: United States intelligence in defense uh
5080.20s: in
5081.12s: infrastructure uh and that they're
5082.80s: engaged in uh trying to transform the
5085.84s: climate of our planet to turn the heat
5088.40s: up on our planet and have it be more
5090.16s: jungly and and uh uh and hot and stuff
5093.72s: because the reptilian people want to be
5095.92s: able toy the warmth yeah uh and uh and
5099.84s: they believe that uh that they are uh
5103.88s: assigned or they've taken upon
5105.44s: themselves the assignment to stop this
5107.32s: horrible thing from happening uh that
5109.48s: they're on the side of the pans and that
5111.80s: they're opposed to the reptilians and
5113.88s: they're opposed to this deep National
5115.92s: Security State here United this the
5117.72s: Church of Scientology Church chologist
5119.68s: you and they they believe that they're
5121.44s: they're entitled to all the same uh
5123.76s: sovereign immunity of Any Nation State
5126.44s: uh claiming they are entitled to at
5128.60s: least the same status that the Catholic
5130.20s: church has and their goals to help the
5133.28s: pleadians to so what's inter protect our
5135.96s: planet against being invaded and
5137.36s: occupied by the reptilians that's that
5140.16s: that's the bottom line wild where where
5142.48s: they're at um there's I'm reading a file
5144.76s: right now have you ever heard of the
5145.60s: lerta files lerta yeah not the circle
5150.40s: I've heard lerta no so lerta is
5155.00s: apparently in 1999 this man who remains
5158.40s: Anonymous met with a
5160.36s: reptilian and who calls herself lerta
5163.68s: she's like you can't pronounce my name
5165.20s: it's like a bunch of hissing and
5166.60s: whatever uh but she meets with him in
5168.92s: her true shape or form or whatever and
5171.96s: fills him in through this document they
5174.08s: met twice I'm reading I've read through
5176.92s: you know the part one of it and she's
5180.28s: basically filling them in on the history
5183.44s: of the rep Ian and what happened on the
5187.08s: planet and so basically and it's funny
5189.12s: that you say like these humanoid looking
5191.60s: pleadians because according to lerta
5194.16s: those are the bad guys uh yes and she
5196.60s: says they're um she says they're very
5198.52s: conniving because they look like us but
5200.76s: here's okay so in a nutshell yeah yeah
5203.72s: uh 65 or like 100 million years ago
5206.72s: whatever it was uh this planet had
5209.84s: nothing really going for it um and there
5213.84s: was sorians as she call them like
5216.24s: dinosaurs were here and intelligent life
5218.48s: naturally evolved into what she called
5220.68s: like the iguanodons the ones with the
5222.32s: thumbs she's like those were actually
5224.32s: intelligent beings and like they lived
5226.16s: here whatever but then there was a war
5228.88s: being fought between these humanoids and
5231.20s: these other reptilians now they don't
5233.08s: know exactly where they're from they
5234.64s: think possibly a separate Universe even
5237.24s: uh but they came here and they were
5239.76s: fighting for this planet one of them was
5241.84s: fighting for
5243.12s: resources and the other one was fighting
5245.48s: for uh they what I think we refer to
5249.08s: them as the Elohim or like Elohim yeah
5251.84s: exactly Elohim Elohim yeah and so uh
5255.60s: basically the Elohim were coming here to
5259.16s: manipulate these um these monkeys that
5262.24s: were hopping around in trees and and the
5263.84s: reptilians were already living here
5265.44s: underground and everything else it was
5267.48s: their planet and then the Elohim came
5270.08s: here manipulated uh the the monkeys to
5273.00s: turn them into humans that they could uh
5275.56s: mine the planet for them and act as
5277.36s: their slaves that thing the gold thing
5279.08s: yeah yeah gold and copper as well they
5281.08s: said um so anyways uh they ended up
5284.40s: leaving for whatever reason it was and
5287.76s: the reptilians were living were kind of
5289.60s: like being forced underground because of
5291.56s: these others but they were like this is
5293.28s: our planet we were here first and so
5295.64s: they were just trying to defend their
5297.28s: planet and what happened is in the Bible
5300.20s: they wrote that Elohim and all of these
5302.60s: human-looking creatures in as Angels
5306.04s: because the Elohim would start scoping
5308.40s: humans and telling them the reptilians
5310.64s: are evil uh we're good uh we're here to
5313.84s: help you and when in fact as reptilians
5316.24s: that were good and they weren't
5318.64s: interfering with us at all and they
5320.16s: weren't they were trying to be peaceful
5322.40s: so it's really interesting you hear that
5324.04s: side there there see I mean that's one
5326.84s: one of one of the many challenges that
5330.64s: we have in the whole UFO investigation
5333.28s: and community because people get
5335.56s: extremely creative yeah uh down into
5338.84s: detail I mean look at the people with
5340.40s: Star Trek I mean they're people who
5343.00s: basically even believe sard Trek is true
5344.88s: yeah they built the universe yeah and
5346.64s: they they know all the the different
5348.12s: names of everybody they know all the
5349.56s: different plants they know all the
5351.12s: different series you know and they like
5353.52s: they've got no life yeah and they live
5356.12s: in this complete fictional construct of
5358.52s: some sort and and now with the the games
5361.40s: that they have the computer games
5363.12s: they're people that are just their whole
5364.84s: life yeah is made up of playing these
5367.52s: games uh and and they they've somehow
5370.64s: despaired I think of the of the
5373.48s: legitimacy of Truth you know and and the
5376.60s: importance of truth because theyve
5378.36s: they've despaired of being able to trust
5380.68s: any people in positions of authority
5383.48s: because the POS the people in positions
5385.56s: of authority have been so discredited
5388.00s: I'm afraid I have to take some credit
5389.40s: for that over the years you know cuz I
5392.32s: thought that that it was not good to
5394.32s: have people just blindly believing
5396.88s: whatever the authorities told us you
5398.72s: know and I took the Constitution
5400.20s: seriously that you know don't don't
5401.60s: blindly trust the government you know
5403.76s: challenge them you know make sure they
5405.24s: prove what they're doing and if they're
5406.92s: doing things incorrectly correct those
5408.88s: things uh in the the in some people I
5412.20s: think in kind of a reductionist mindset
5415.36s: the minute they can't have absolute
5417.52s: confidence and what the government says
5419.00s: they have none at
5420.36s: all uh and the minute that you point out
5423.16s: that there's some pretty various things
5424.80s: going on with the government and you try
5426.52s: to mobilize them to cure those things
5429.12s: they just throw in the towel yeah and
5431.40s: say I don't believe any that any anymore
5433.88s: but but when you when you find people
5436.28s: you know spending entire weekends
5439.04s: sitting watching Men knock a little ball
5442.12s: as far as they can and knock it into a
5443.84s: hole and they spend the you know
5446.12s: millions of dollars uh you know watching
5448.68s: that stuff and listening to that or
5450.20s: chasing a football up and down the field
5452.56s: or you know basketball Bang bangity bang
5455.32s: sticking in the hoop you know that
5457.00s: they've they've what they've done is
5458.32s: they've
5459.24s: substituted some kind of uh you
5463.24s: know constricted uh realm of absolute uh
5468.88s: attention that they can pay to something
5471.08s: where you get winners and losers uh in
5473.92s: in a in a in a dialectical Dynamic that
5476.20s: is somehow energizing uh and and it
5479.12s: provides some kind of a sense of purpose
5480.96s: or value to their lives some of them are
5483.32s: are just these fanatical I mean take a
5485.52s: look at the Los Angeles Raiders fans you
5488.52s: know who dress up in these crazy
5490.00s: Montreal Canadians we got some wild fans
5491.96s: here too yeah yeah I mean it just I mean
5494.56s: in they've they've substituted really
5497.84s: trying to pay attention to anything
5499.64s: really important in the world uh because
5503.44s: they're despairing of being able to
5505.12s: trust the people in the authorities
5507.36s: right and so that they've attached
5508.68s: themselves to this other completely
5510.48s: artificial binary world uh and and in in
5516.24s: and meanwhile you know 10 million people
5518.64s: world a year starve to death on the
5520.84s: planet you know millions of others die
5522.92s: of diseases that we've known the cure
5524.76s: for for hundred years and the people
5527.64s: aren't paying any attention to that at
5529.08s: all they've been they've been burnt
5531.04s: before and that's as far as they're
5532.48s: willing to go and so that we we have
5534.20s: this important responsibility to try to
5538.32s: reestablish legitimacy in the if we
5542.48s: believe that there are some legit imate
5544.36s: institutions that can be helpful to
5546.72s: people collectively our collective
5548.68s: decision making as a human family you
5551.56s: know that we we have to try to
5553.28s: resuscitate some trust in the
5555.24s: institutions even though you know I I
5558.20s: found it fairly simple early on just to
5561.20s: take a kind of just go after them
5563.28s: attitude you know find out what they're
5564.88s: doing wrong go after them bring them
5566.80s: into court you know but all the time I
5569.48s: was attempting to prove that the
5571.64s: judicial system could work yeah you know
5574.68s: so therefore that we can we can you know
5577.68s: you know theer Channel get get our
5579.72s: government back in tune yeah as I said
5582.04s: that I started out thinking I just had
5583.64s: to kind of help retune the government to
5585.96s: be doing what it's supposed to be doing
5588.88s: uh but the real problem is that I have
5592.20s: discovered that you know that our our
5594.40s: country had been captured by this
5598.04s: National Security element that was
5600.12s: directly linked with corporate power uh
5602.88s: and private
5604.32s: greed uh and and I can see where people
5607.72s: would almost despair of being able to to
5611.24s: break that hold you know uh and and also
5615.08s: ched us for only being able to get
5617.56s: partial victories each time you know you
5620.00s: know that we can get them to stop doing
5621.76s: like the enterprise we can get them to
5623.64s: stop you know shipping weapons to the
5625.96s: the government you know the the Contra
5627.92s: forces against the Nicaraguan government
5630.08s: you know or we can get them to stop the
5631.60s: heroin smuggling coming out of Southeast
5633.56s: St into Havana you know with Batista no
5637.08s: but but the bottom line is that they
5639.12s: still keep on coming yeah you know and
5641.32s: so that a lot of the young people just
5643.00s: give up on that naturally and and so
5645.64s: that this this uh this issue here with
5648.68s: the with the UFO stuff in the
5650.60s: Extraterrestrial civilization you know I
5652.60s: go all the way back to when I was 7
5654.64s: years old of realizing that that the
5658.24s: kind of the things that we're doing to
5660.24s: ourselves here uh are are so
5664.36s: incompatible and inconsistent with the
5666.92s: larger perspective that if we could just
5669.32s: get people to to shift over to this
5671.48s: larger perspective and and really
5674.56s: understand you know where we really are
5676.64s: in the universe that hopefully we could
5679.48s: atrophy some of this uh desire to engage
5683.28s: in these completely false dialectics
5685.60s: against each other yeah and and trying
5687.48s: to find meaning out of vanquishing some
5690.20s: ultimate other uh and and get into a
5692.64s: much more colleg ual Collective
5695.32s: consciousness of of doing good for our
5697.80s: people uh and I'm I'm hoping that we can
5700.36s: do that I think that this particular
5702.52s: subject uh in addition to the original
5705.52s: just complete
5707.32s: awesome effect that it had on me uh to
5710.60s: to understand kind of a practical
5712.72s: application of this to be able to make
5714.88s: an argument to people look this is a
5716.52s: really practical program that we're
5718.84s: engaged in here trying to elevate the
5721.24s: consciousness of our human family so
5723.48s: that we can stop threatening to destroy
5725.52s: ourselves with thermonuclear weapons or
5727.76s: or destroy our planet by you know
5729.92s: contaminating it with you know chemicals
5732.32s: pouring chemicals into the atmosphere
5734.00s: and into the rivers you know that that
5736.12s: we ought to be able to solve these
5738.20s: problems if we have a a more expansive
5740.96s: uh perspective yeah and that's why it's
5742.92s: so important to really come to
5744.80s: understand what the agenda is of the
5747.92s: Extraterrestrial beings if there's any
5750.32s: truth at all in these these others
5754.00s: stories nightmare stories you know if
5757.12s: there's a bad guy you know species
5759.80s: that's trying to come in and take over
5761.04s: our plan we need to know that yeah you
5763.00s: know or if there's some kind of
5764.04s: Confrontation between some good guys and
5766.04s: bad guys in outer space and they're
5768.64s: they're struggling over what's going to
5770.40s: happen to our planet we need to know
5772.24s: that you know how do you discern as well
5775.44s: as a lower you know species in in you
5780.04s: know we're we're pretty much the bottom
5781.92s: of the totem pole when it comes to you
5784.48s: know I would suspect I don't know this
5786.40s: but I mean when you know when when you
5788.72s: witness these Feats of incredible magic
5792.84s: that we see you know with these
5794.16s: creatures you assume that they're so
5795.88s: much more intelligent and have access to
5798.28s: so much more of the quantum field than
5799.96s: we do that they're able to pretty much
5803.64s: manipulate Us in any way right so
5808.52s: being being benevolent or seeming
5811.56s: benevolent shouldn't be that hard to
5813.84s: convince us you know what I mean it
5815.48s: shouldn't be it's not going to be that
5818.04s: difficult if they wanted to deceive us
5820.40s: it shouldn't be that difficult for them
5822.60s: you know and I always hold that position
5824.52s: you know you you talked about John Mack
5826.44s: he had much more of like a a um a
5829.00s: positive outlook for uh for the nhi John
5832.32s: did and then David Jacobs you know had
5834.36s: much more of like no they're deceiving
5836.52s: and you know the truth is it could be
5838.92s: both it could be a spectrum there could
5841.20s: be many different types of nhi and all
5844.16s: this I often think like when I have this
5848.24s: example like if my if my water bottle
5851.00s: started speaking to me right now if it
5852.64s: grew a mouth and just started speaking
5854.12s: to me and once I get over the fact that
5855.60s: I'm not having a psychotic break or
5857.52s: hallucinating and that this was real um
5861.00s: I would probably be inclined to believe
5863.12s: everything it
5864.60s: says yeah I hear you simply on the fact
5867.28s: that it's proven to me that on some
5869.48s: level my reality is a lie it's already
5871.40s: blown out your analogical
5874.04s: and it's created a new reality a reality
5876.72s: it's a very dangerous situation yeah and
5878.84s: so I must be cautious in listening to
5882.00s: anything that it says because at this
5883.56s: point I'm very vulnerable and I'm very
5885.92s: you know capable and and that's sort of
5888.52s: what I see happening with a lot of these
5891.00s: prophetic messages or a lot of these
5893.00s: communications with nhi with a lot of
5895.40s: abductees specifically is that they're
5898.20s: given this message of oh the world's
5900.76s: going to blow up if you don't do
5901.88s: something and I'm always struggling with
5903.76s: that because I'm like what the what the
5905.52s: hell you want me to do well well the the
5907.60s: the the advantage that I've taken on
5909.36s: that is that you know if what it is that
5912.00s: they're advocating we do such as stop
5914.20s: polluting our planet yeah or stop
5916.68s: threatening to blow the whole planet up
5918.36s: to smithin I mean it's hard to find a
5920.96s: downside to that uh except they do I
5924.44s: mean I know that the people in the
5925.72s: National Security State say oh well you
5927.48s: look they're trying to talk us out of
5928.84s: using our nuclear weapons because our
5931.28s: nuclear weapons can be used against them
5933.00s: and so they're trying to get us to
5934.12s: voluntarily disarm so they've already
5936.48s: gotten out ahead of that one yeah you
5938.20s: know but but the fact of the matter is
5940.68s: that the nuclear weapons don't make any
5943.84s: sense anyway I mean we all know that I
5946.48s: mean and as long as we could get some
5948.04s: kind of mutual standown on that of
5950.32s: course that's what John Kennedy was
5951.56s: attempting to do with with cruff uh in
5955.60s: 1963 uh you know after the Cuban Missile
5957.88s: Crisis they were actually engaged in the
5959.72s: process of trying to figure out how to
5962.00s: disassemble the nuclear warheads in both
5964.80s: nuclear arsenals and Destroy them to get
5967.64s: rid of this thing once and for all uh
5969.84s: you know but we we have to get back to
5972.24s: that and and it does if if conceivably
5977.28s: you know the nuclear weapons are the
5979.20s: only mechanism that we would have that
5981.72s: could really we could defend ourselves
5984.68s: against an invasion this would be part
5987.08s: of their agenda yeah to do that and so
5989.80s: that that's a that's a a major risk in
5992.60s: and of itself but I mean the risk of our
5995.00s: own self-destruction with the
5996.88s: thermonuclear weapon just as great is is
5999.24s: probably a little more immediate
6000.76s: probably yeah more immediate yeah that's
6002.40s: that one that one we got a pretty good
6003.92s: grip on know we know that one's true the
6006.72s: other one we don't uh and so that uh
6010.04s: I've been devoted my whole professional
6012.48s: life to trying to support the uh the
6016.40s: disassembly and destruction of all of
6019.00s: the nuclear warheads on the planet and
6021.40s: now that that doesn't destroy the
6023.60s: technology and the knowledge of know how
6025.08s: to do it again if you want to sure yeah
6027.24s: uh so it doesn't cure the problem but it
6029.84s: can it can definitely eliminate the
6031.92s: immediate threat of our of our going to
6035.12s: that yeah there is there is something um
6037.72s: you know
6039.52s: to there is something to the idea that
6042.40s: like in order to get to that next level
6045.16s: we have to cooperate and that's just
6047.28s: like that's plain as day um you know we
6051.08s: have this unfortunate
6053.60s: record of coming up with the greatest
6055.88s: technology
6057.48s: through the most violent atrocities yeah
6062.20s: right that's that's our that's our track
6063.76s: record how how do we come up with the
6066.36s: best technology well we literally have
6068.76s: to kill each other and be in a position
6071.08s: of survival where we through pressure
6074.12s: dig in dig into our our greatest
6076.12s: intellectual resources exactly and and I
6079.44s: you know there's part of me that feels
6081.00s: like man this would be much easier if we
6082.76s: just work together like I mean you could
6084.84s: probably achieve that even quicker and
6088.00s: you know when you look at the the fmy
6089.64s: Paradox or or the uh or you know that
6092.68s: sort of breaching breaching this level
6096.44s: of uh intelligence in order to get to
6099.32s: that next level like first we got to get
6100.68s: off the planet and then we got to get to
6102.72s: that next level we got to get before the
6104.36s: planet dies like we're in this small
6106.04s: little pocket yeah I mean I feel like
6109.84s: any civilization who has ever
6114.00s: broadened their reach outside of their
6117.08s: own solar system had to have worked
6122.72s: together to get there I can't believe
6125.64s: that there's war going on in these
6127.32s: places meanwhile they're also leaving
6129.76s: the planet and exploring the universe
6131.68s: like I mean that that seems to be to me
6133.84s: anyways fundamental in order to you know
6137.84s: whether it's seeding life Across the
6139.40s: Universe or whether it's just visiting
6141.08s: other you know galaxies I think you have
6143.48s: to come to to that point in order to
6145.96s: make it and I think most planets
6148.40s: probably end up destroying themselves
6150.16s: before they get there yeah it's it's one
6151.88s: of it's one of the the first questions
6153.92s: that you would want to ask him when when
6155.96s: John Mack and I back in must been
6159.84s: 1996 97 or so that we had the big
6163.56s: confrontation with Harvard throughout 94
6165.76s: and into 95 it was almost 16 18 months
6168.84s: we were doing that but then when we
6170.88s: started working at the peer group the
6172.84s: project for Extraordinary experience
6174.56s: research we were working at trying to
6177.48s: figure out this new paradigm thing uh
6181.24s: and we were trying to develop a citizen
6184.68s: diplomacy core I mentioned to you the
6187.00s: other night that that uh that people who
6189.68s: seem to be repeated
6191.92s: abductees that we thought that look as
6194.08s: long as you're getting set to have to
6195.64s: have this experience again why why don't
6198.64s: we train you to do holotropic breathing
6201.64s: so that you can relax and get centered
6203.92s: when it starts to happen and then you
6206.00s: can remain calm enough to kind of ask
6209.12s: them questions and and seek
6211.40s: communication with them you know and not
6213.88s: just get zapped and Frozen and terrified
6217.00s: Panic you know and so that that's what
6218.68s: we were engaged in then and uh that I
6222.40s: think that an active citizen movement of
6226.56s: people unconnected to the National
6229.64s: Security State infrastructure reaching
6232.56s: out to a establish direct communication
6234.92s: with the beings we now know that that
6237.76s: mental telepathy is real we know that
6240.84s: they use this and they know that we know
6243.48s: that we can communicate with them on it
6245.68s: if we could uh reach past the National
6249.00s: Security State structures uh and have
6251.96s: direct citizen to Citizen communication
6254.32s: with these beings and try to establish a
6256.84s: peaceful positive and productive
6259.52s: relationship with them I know this
6262.16s: freaks out the n Security State people
6264.24s: because that whether they're conscious
6266.32s: of it all the time or not and I've
6268.80s: discovered they're more conscious of it
6270.04s: than I had originally suspect that they
6272.00s: think that their mission is to basically
6274.32s: be able to apply military force and the
6277.20s: threat of military force to maintain our
6279.80s: continued privileged access to the
6282.24s: Strategic raw materials of the planet
6284.68s: for the benefit of our major
6286.36s: corporations which is the actual wording
6288.76s: of the document the 1992 United States
6291.52s: defense department policy planning
6293.16s: guidance document that was promulgated
6295.80s: immediately after we were involved in
6298.28s: talking gorbachov to step back out of
6301.48s: the Cold War our the Jesuit office was
6304.60s: we were actually in direct communication
6307.00s: with
6307.84s: gorbachov uh and uh it was I should
6311.60s: probably tell you the story it's because
6313.60s: a lot of people don't know about it you
6315.32s: know that that uh let's see how how this
6318.28s: went uh I had in in our Jesuit
6322.24s: headquarters office
6323.68s: we had succeeded first of all in in and
6327.40s: I I was initiated the the the position
6331.12s: that to be in possession of nuclear
6334.28s: weapons was a self immortal sin because
6338.36s: the nuclear weapons were designed
6340.40s: intrinsically to annihilate civilian
6342.92s: populations and it's a complete
6344.76s: violation of the just War theory that
6347.24s: you cannot make war on the civilian
6349.40s: population of your adversary okay uh and
6353.40s: so so therefore the mere possession of
6355.24s: them was a mortal sin we got the the
6358.08s: Jesuit headquarters to take that
6360.80s: position okay uh and then we leaned in
6363.84s: on the US Catholic Conference of Bishops
6366.68s: to take that position not an easy task I
6370.96s: had one of my classmates from Harvard
6373.88s: Divinity School uh who work under me at
6379.00s: the Jesuit headquarters Dr Jim Garrison
6382.28s: actually James Garrison uh and uh
6385.92s: he worked at meeting with the different
6388.92s: Catholic Bishops to get them to come on
6390.68s: board kind of shamed them one at a time
6393.12s: into having to agree that this was that
6396.12s: this this was the the position we should
6398.68s: take so we got them to take the position
6401.52s: uh then we got the national board of
6403.00s: Homeland Ministry of the national
6404.36s: Methodist Church to take the same
6406.24s: position okay so then what we were going
6408.64s: to do is move from there to try to get
6412.00s: uh all of the 54 major denominations
6414.68s: through the Washington inter religious
6416.12s: staff Council to take a position that we
6419.04s: wanted our United States government to
6421.36s: unilaterally cut back on a disassemble
6424.64s: and Destroy 10% of our nuclear warheads
6428.16s: but that we were going to have to get
6429.76s: Russia to do it as to respond so we
6432.60s: could begin this was when the salt talks
6434.68s: were going on the Strategic arms
6436.44s: limitations talks and all they were
6438.36s: doing under the salt talks this is like
6441.08s: 1979 1980
6443.68s: that all they were doing is agreeing
6445.28s: between Russia and the United States to
6447.52s: build fewer more than they were planning
6450.36s: to make so instead of making a 100 new
6452.76s: nuclear missiles you know they'd make
6454.56s: only 50 you know uh and you say well
6457.12s: that's not going in the right direction
6458.92s: so what we got to do is try to reverse
6460.60s: that process so we said look if we could
6463.04s: uh if we could mobilize all 54 of our
6465.32s: major religious denominations and all of
6467.68s: our citizens to demand a 10% cut back in
6471.56s: our nuclear warheads
6473.40s: if we could get the Soviet Union to
6474.84s: respond we could begin that process and
6477.68s: over a 10-year period if we could do
6479.64s: that 10% each year we could get rid of
6482.52s: them in 10 years right so that was the
6484.92s: the plan that we were involved in uh and
6487.44s: uh
6488.48s: dror he wasn't he didn't have his PhD
6491.00s: yet but Jim Garrison was getting set to
6493.72s: go leave my staff and go back to England
6498.12s: to do his PhD under JT Robinson uh there
6501.32s: at uh Cambridge University
6503.36s: and so he went back there uh and he when
6506.56s: he arrived there he went to see the uh
6509.44s: the uh uh uh what do they call the the
6513.04s: chaplain uh at uh at Cambridge
6515.76s: University and said you know my name is
6517.92s: Jim Garrison I just got through working
6519.76s: with Dan Shin at the Jesuit headquarters
6521.88s: you know we've we're working at trying
6524.00s: to get a 10% cut back in the US missiles
6527.44s: Warheads uh and I need to try to figure
6529.76s: out how we can get to work with the so
6531.12s: can you figure out how to help me well
6533.32s: the guy was flabbergasted right and said
6535.16s: oh well uh I think that's above my pay
6537.40s: grade here I'm the chaplain and he said
6539.52s: well but but now now you think of it
6541.56s: there's a guy here who's in Residence
6543.44s: now in Cambridge for this year who's
6545.64s: actually writing a major book about
6548.48s: nuclear weapons uh and it's uh frof cpra
6552.92s: uh the guy that wrote uh the uh um the
6556.76s: da of physics okay and he's writing a
6559.92s: book uh advocating the elimination of
6563.36s: nuclear weapons so I could I could
6565.24s: introduce you to him so he did okay so
6568.72s: Jim then goes to meet with frof kaer and
6571.24s: pitches the same thing to frof you know
6573.92s: we're trying to get the Soviet Union to
6575.40s: cut back on it if we blah blah and frof
6577.76s: kaer says well I don't no but but I I
6580.36s: was given a grant uh to write this book
6583.92s: by Mrs Rose Cruz this woman who's here
6586.68s: in England her husband is a brigadier
6588.92s: general and knows all the people on the
6590.92s: national the uh uh Brit Royal Academy of
6594.32s: Science and is this big heavyweight guy
6597.16s: uh I'll introduce you to her and see if
6599.36s: she can help so he goes and meets Mrs
6601.16s: Rose Cruz uh her husband has passed away
6603.88s: but she introduces Jim to all the
6606.36s: members of the Royal Academy of Science
6609.48s: and he talks them each of them into
6611.88s: writing a letter that their counterpart
6613.76s: in the Soviet Academy of Science right
6616.52s: uh and and so they all write a little
6618.24s: personal letter of introduction to him
6620.28s: and then Mrs Rose Cruz agrees to give
6622.32s: him 2-year Grant to go to the Soviet
6625.12s: Union right to figure out how to how to
6628.48s: do so he ends up writing his thesis and
6632.52s: getting it published then he gets he
6634.44s: does research and he gets a little book
6635.96s: published called the myth of the Soviet
6637.68s: threat so you know the Soviets aren't
6639.68s: getting ready to attack us across the
6641.24s: polar ice caps you know uh their ass is
6643.80s: getting set to fall off you know they
6645.20s: can't even maintain their economy so he
6647.36s: writes this book called The Myth of the
6648.96s: Soviet threat so he's got the his book
6651.96s: now published he's got the Grant from
6654.40s: Mrs Rose Cruz and he's got all these
6656.20s: letters of recommendation to the the the
6658.88s: members of the Soviet Academy of Science
6660.96s: and so he goes over he calls me from Red
6662.84s: Square Danny okay I'm here you know I've
6665.48s: got all this stuff ready you know I've
6666.96s: got to go get an apartment figure so so
6669.12s: we're we're having these set of
6670.32s: conversations right and so what he does
6672.64s: is goes one by one he starts going to
6674.56s: these different members of the Soviet
6675.96s: Academy of Science uh and finally the
6678.96s: first one says I don't know what you're
6680.24s: talking about I can't fig do fin he
6681.88s: finds one guy and he says look I don't
6683.52s: know what to do but my one of my good
6685.72s: friends is the medical doctor for
6688.80s: bnv and bnv has this terrible heart
6691.72s: condition and so the doctor has to see
6693.56s: him every day what I can do is I can
6695.64s: give him your materials and and and have
6698.08s: him give these to to brv right and so he
6701.64s: does that and so the medical doctor
6703.48s: shows all the stuff to bnv about what we
6705.32s: want to do and brev has Jim Garrison my
6709.48s: best friend at Harvard Divinity School
6711.60s: was on my staff at Jesuit headquarters
6713.56s: who's now over there to meet with uh the
6717.36s: uh the doctor for for bzv and they
6721.36s: together co-produce a three-hour
6723.80s: documentary film on what would happen if
6727.20s: one United States multi-war headed
6729.76s: nuclear missile were to land dead center
6732.32s: in the geographic center of the Soviet
6734.60s: Union of how all the water it would
6736.76s: destroy and all the land that would be
6738.20s: totally wiped out from any growing food
6741.36s: and so they do that right then brv dies
6745.36s: uh and then andropov comes in and so
6748.28s: Jimmy Jim is meeting with shevanti right
6752.60s: getting ready to try to set up a meeting
6754.24s: to get to meet with andropov who's come
6756.12s: in to try to pitch the same thing to him
6758.56s: right uh in in chanat he says no no no
6761.44s: he says you do not need to meet andropov
6763.28s: he says he will not be here that long he
6765.44s: said who you need to beet is gorbachov
6768.04s: gorbachov who is KGB he is the KGB
6772.96s: prot of on he says he will be president
6775.84s: someday he's that secretary of
6777.16s: agriculture right in the party and so
6779.96s: Jim sets up a meeting to uh to meet with
6783.28s: gorbachov when he's still this is like
6785.60s: 1980 81 right and so he goes to the
6789.12s: Kremlin to meet gorbachov and uh they he
6792.72s: comes in goes into the Kremlin I'm I'm
6794.72s: sitting I'm sitting at the eselin
6796.88s: institute in one of the hot tubs passing
6798.56s: a joint back and forth with Jimmy he's
6800.64s: telling me the story about how how this
6803.04s: happened right so he says so I go to the
6805.48s: Kremlin I go through this these 10 12
6807.88s: foot tall doors I go into this room with
6810.12s: the Kremlin and we're sitting there and
6811.76s: then in comes gorbach and we sit down
6814.24s: and I start telling him about you know
6816.40s: my name is Jim Garrison and here's I'm
6818.24s: Danny she my best friends at Jesuit
6820.00s: headquarters we're going to try to get a
6821.40s: unilateral cut back on the 10% of the
6823.40s: Miss but we've got to get you to respond
6825.16s: to this and uh gorbachov who will talk
6827.92s: English in private but he won't talk
6830.20s: publicly but he said uh us will never do
6833.56s: this he said they will never take the
6834.92s: lead on this he said because they
6837.32s: believe that they need to have the
6838.84s: nuclear weapons he said not for
6841.32s: us China H he said he said they know
6846.32s: that China can put a a billion men into
6849.64s: the field as they proved in Korea yeah
6852.84s: he said and so they know they can't take
6854.44s: him on in a traditional War which
6856.20s: they're going to have to eventually said
6858.04s: so that they can't they can't they don't
6860.16s: want to get rid of the nuclear weapons
6861.44s: he said so I'm going to have to do this
6863.80s: he said so when I become president I can
6865.96s: take this initiative he said but they
6867.84s: will come for me in the night when I
6870.60s: start doing this he said so you have to
6872.96s: agree to become the president of the
6874.48s: gorbachov foundation uh and take this up
6877.48s: with me to try to disarm the the world
6879.88s: of nuclear weapons wow uh and uh so
6882.72s: that's how Jim Garrison became the
6884.24s: president of the garbage Foundation wow
6886.40s: my best friend from Divinity School with
6888.28s: my staff guy at Jesuit headquarters so
6890.88s: they're the ones that in they did they
6892.96s: came for people don't remember this
6894.56s: scorb chop got kidnapped yeah and
6897.28s: disappeared for like a whole week that's
6899.12s: when yelson came in you know riding on
6901.36s: the front of the the the tanks and they
6903.68s: came into red square and and P pushed
6906.00s: back against that and made them release
6907.56s: him uh and then yelson ran for president
6910.32s: and one and then gorbachov and Jim
6912.92s: Garrison and US decided we were going to
6916.44s: start putting together a thing called
6917.80s: the state of the world Forum at the end
6920.04s: of the Cold War uh because that the gbop
6924.04s: before he was leaving he was going to
6926.12s: sign this release of all of the Soviet
6929.68s: Socialist republics which he did on
6932.20s: December 31st of 1991 and released all
6935.36s: of them right our response this was a
6939.72s: President George Bush Senior George HW
6942.24s: Bush 1991 he'd been elected in 1988
6945.48s: remember he was vice president from 1980
6947.64s: to then ' 84 then from ' 84 to 88 he
6950.36s: runs for the presidency and in in uh in
6952.92s: 19 uh 88 and winds okay so he's there as
6957.84s: president uh and uh in 1991 December
6961.16s: 31st what happens is the following
6965.28s: Monday uh the his George bus senior's
6969.08s: Secretary of Defense Dick
6971.36s: Cheney you know convenes a meeting at
6974.80s: the In The West Wing of the White House
6976.88s: with uh with uh uh Paul Wolowitz Doug F
6980.80s: scooter Libby uh
6982.96s: uh Richard Pearl a bunch of the guys
6985.08s: that are in the defense department with
6986.68s: with with Cheney and they say oh look
6989.44s: this is terrible this you know that
6992.88s: we're we're going to have everybody rise
6994.68s: up and say we're going to have to cut
6996.04s: our military budget like in half because
6998.44s: we've been justifying for the last 75
7000.56s: years the fact that we'd have to spend
7002.32s: 700 to800 billion dollars a year on our
7005.08s: military defense because Russia is
7007.08s: trying to take over the whole world you
7008.84s: know and there's going to be a big push
7010.20s: for us to have to cut back all of our
7012.28s: says so so what we need to do is lean in
7014.56s: and as to increase the military budget
7017.68s: because we want to be able to establish
7019.44s: full spectrum military dominance over
7022.24s: the whole planet so that nobody that
7024.60s: nobody can challenge us at all this is a
7026.56s: unique opportunity in the last 100 years
7029.00s: so that we can move in on this and so
7031.44s: they they put they put together this
7032.96s: 1992 United States defense department of
7035.20s: policy planning guidance document
7037.20s: proposing this top secret stuff right
7040.24s: they end up that that's it starts right
7042.32s: the first Monday after December 31st of
7044.84s: 1991 so this is the new 1992 United
7048.12s: States defense department policy
7049.56s: planning guidance document right and so
7051.68s: that they end up as of April they come
7054.36s: out with this this document and they
7056.28s: make it available to some restricted
7058.80s: number of people in the Pentagon and a
7061.48s: few members of the cabinet somebody
7063.64s: leaks a copy of it to the Washington
7065.64s: Post Washington Post on like April 10th
7068.64s: of 1992 they come out with this scathing
7071.48s: editorial against this saying this is an
7074.40s: absolutely wrong response to the step
7076.28s: back that that gorbachov has done he
7078.60s: said you know that uh that this is like
7081.00s: a return to gunboat diplomacy yeah okay
7084.12s: which is not ironic because that's
7086.44s: exactly what it was because this was the
7088.96s: Soviet Union stepping back after the
7091.12s: October 1917 mhm Revolution where they
7096.36s: rose up as a challenge to the people who
7100.24s: had at the following at the end of World
7102.36s: War
7103.64s: I had begun funding the rise of Hitler
7106.52s: in Germany which was Brown Brothers
7108.64s: Herman yeah which was you know uh George
7112.12s: Herbert
7113.52s: Walker uh and the guys that Brown
7115.88s: brothers herin who set up the Union Bank
7118.12s: of New York and set up a subsidiary in
7120.04s: the Netherlands called the bank of
7121.64s: shipping and commerce run by a guy by
7123.48s: Fritz Thon funded the Reconstruction of
7125.72s: the entire International headquarters
7127.20s: the Third Reich yeah this this this we
7130.36s: know about this at Jesuit headquarters
7132.80s: uh so that this is in deep background of
7135.36s: all the stuff that we know about and so
7138.08s: this complex question of how we deal
7141.16s: with the National Security State that's
7143.32s: has been set up by the United States and
7145.92s: the response now that's now in Russia
7148.52s: and in China now that have got their
7150.64s: same National Security State
7152.52s: infrastructures you know uh all of whom
7155.00s: know about the UFO stuff yeah of course
7157.44s: I mean and and not only that I mean
7159.56s: their presidents know about it way more
7161.08s: than ours do yeah and and so the the the
7163.96s: the thing is that we if the American
7166.28s: citizens can organize and rise up and
7169.40s: the people of Canada can organize and
7171.88s: rise up and we can get the people in
7173.60s: England and five yeah if if we can if we
7176.48s: can get the people to rise up yeah and
7178.64s: say look at we're going to reach out and
7180.32s: establish direct communication uh
7183.20s: because we now know the secret about
7184.96s: telepathic communication with these
7186.56s: beings if we can reach out and and
7189.16s: convince these beings that that we want
7191.72s: to have have a peaceful and productive
7194.72s: relationship with them but we want to
7197.20s: make sure that they don't have any kind
7198.88s: of a nefarious motive to be trying to
7201.56s: you know exploit us or take advantage of
7203.76s: us you know we want to be able to do
7206.12s: this and that's what the new paradig
7208.20s: Institute is really all about you know
7209.88s: and we're not we're no pikers I mean you
7211.88s: know we've been we've been involved in
7213.36s: these things now for 50 years you know
7215.88s: uh yeah that's that's the one thing that
7218.12s: um that I'm coming to realize as well is
7220.80s: the more I find out about the new Paran
7222.48s: Institute is you know that this isn't
7224.80s: just some other euphology group that's
7228.16s: interested in like the pleadian star
7230.88s: system at all this is this is real you
7234.36s: you you you are probably the people that
7237.44s: are the most involved yeah with Congress
7242.24s: even currently in the current
7243.56s: Administration as well that's right I
7245.36s: mean they just bipartisan we've suceeded
7247.48s: in establishing bipartisan Outreach to
7250.32s: both political leaderships with the new
7253.08s: uh task force that has been uh that's
7255.48s: right that has been put together with
7257.56s: you know uh congresswoman Luna that's
7259.88s: right um you're currently in
7262.96s: conversations with them that's right um
7265.44s: and I think that I think you know that's
7267.20s: just a wonderful thing for for both you
7270.40s: know people familiar with the UFO topic
7273.12s: and people who aren't for them to be
7274.96s: familiar with it uh I think it's a great
7277.04s: great place because the you know you f
7280.36s: the UFO Community is a bit of an Echo
7281.72s: chain chamber yeah and we often forget
7285.52s: that public perception of this is
7288.88s: still you know in the early phases yeah
7291.92s: that's right uh the people aren't
7293.28s: knowledgeable to this there there's
7294.92s: still a stigma you know even though the
7296.92s: stigma within the community is is you
7298.60s: know slowly dissipating uh but the
7301.76s: Public's perception of it and you know
7304.00s: so when when people like yourself get
7305.60s: involved who's been around you know so
7308.36s: many credible uh and and as I mentioned
7311.00s: some of the biggest cases is in US
7312.60s: history for someone of your stature to
7315.16s: step in and collaborate with Congress I
7319.08s: mean it shows it's a show of force of of
7322.72s: of Will and of uh you know this this
7325.64s: this this strive for Humanity to want to
7328.88s: essentially make contact that's right
7331.32s: and and develop a dialogue and and if if
7333.80s: we can get the citizens and we can we
7336.20s: know how to do it we know how to
7337.48s: mobilize us we we have to educate people
7339.48s: we need Pat price yeah well with we have
7342.40s: Pat prices around you know we we've
7344.60s: we've got remote viewers and stuff that
7346.60s: are working with us uh in that you know
7349.60s: we we're trying to maintain completely
7351.36s: positive relations with both Republican
7353.20s: Democratic party people inside the
7355.08s: administration people even in the last
7356.92s: Administration matter what they think of
7358.80s: each other you know because this is part
7361.64s: of what we have we have to get over you
7364.20s: know we have to learn how to get past
7366.32s: these kind of internally generated
7368.80s: conflicts among ourselves yeah in order
7370.92s: to be trusted to have a meaningful you
7373.80s: know Alliance or relationship with the
7375.96s: Extraterrestrial so the new paradigm
7377.96s: Institute is is setting up uh citizens
7380.80s: for disclosure inside of each of the 435
7384.56s: congressional districts uh in a state
7387.32s: level office in all 50 of the of the
7389.96s: states in the United States we want to
7392.08s: have them in Canada here uh we we want
7394.60s: to have one here in Montreal uh and uh
7398.48s: and that's why that's why I've come to
7400.76s: talk with you actually this is a real
7402.92s: life event here is that you know that I
7405.32s: I want you to help facilitate getting
7408.32s: the people here together to talk about
7410.76s: this and on your show you have this
7412.68s: opportunity to reach out to everybody to
7414.28s: bring these people on to talk about this
7416.40s: and help educate the people and and help
7418.88s: get everybody that is listening to you
7421.48s: to become citizens for disclosure uh
7424.04s: they can be Canadians for disclosure
7426.44s: right and they can have these chapters
7428.32s: and what we will do at the new paradigm
7429.92s: Institute we've put in this huge
7432.28s: computer system that we have now of of
7434.64s: every action where we can reach down and
7437.52s: communicate individually with every one
7439.60s: of the 435 congressional districts in
7442.48s: each of the 50 states so that we can
7444.72s: contact them and provide specific
7446.72s: targeted information for them to give to
7449.40s: their elected representative uh and what
7451.84s: committees they're on and and and and
7454.20s: get get the citizens to start becoming
7456.64s: citizens instead of sitting back and
7458.92s: just watching watching hockey games and
7461.44s: in football games and you know uh and uh
7464.84s: or you know being on computer games you
7467.80s: know get get involved in the big game
7470.88s: this is the big game this one okay and
7473.96s: so that we we want we want you to help
7477.08s: become you know one of the leaders uh of
7479.92s: a citizens for disclosure here in in
7483.64s: Canada uh in your provinces to have a
7487.60s: province office of each one to have
7489.56s: citizens for disclosure or can adans for
7492.24s: disclosure and reach out to your
7494.20s: Parliament and get them to pass a
7496.24s: statute here like this like we we're we
7500.40s: have we have succeeded in getting the
7502.64s: United States Senate to pass this
7505.04s: 64-page bill this is the controlled
7508.16s: disclosure act this is the shocking bill
7511.96s: that we got passed the United States
7513.68s: Senate Republicans and Democrats alike
7516.72s: came out of the Senate intelligence
7518.08s: committee 17 to zero the vote on this
7521.08s: wow okay uh in uh in we we got uh of the
7524.64s: of the 100 Senators we got 94 of the
7527.04s: Senators to vote for this okay went over
7530.16s: to the house side if if we can get this
7532.12s: put onto the floor of the House of
7534.52s: Representatives that that of the 435
7537.60s: people we'll get 400 of them to vote for
7539.92s: this uh and what this is putting is
7542.36s: putting together a process by means of
7545.36s: which every single document that uh is
7549.60s: that the United States government and
7551.16s: every piece of evidence physical
7552.68s: evidence they've got pertaining to the
7554.72s: UFO issue since January 1st of
7557.84s: 1945 has to be publicly revealed to the
7561.64s: National Archives okay uh and then that
7565.12s: that National Archives is going there's
7566.60s: going to be a team a nine-person uh
7569.76s: panel that's going to be assigned by the
7571.96s: president to review all of those
7574.24s: documents and to make every single one
7576.36s: of the documents that's more than 25
7578.28s: years old publicly available wow okay uh
7582.76s: and people people don't are shocked to
7585.96s: discover I mean they're almost as
7587.56s: shocked that we got this bill passed as
7589.56s: the fact that they they're UFOs yeah you
7592.04s: know but we we've gotten this past it
7593.92s: got stalled over on the house side we
7595.76s: got 23 pages of these 64 Pages passed
7599.48s: which mandate that they gather together
7601.72s: all the information and prepare to give
7604.24s: it over to the National Archives they're
7606.32s: under orders to do this they have to
7608.08s: have all that documentation put together
7610.36s: by September of this year MH okay and
7613.48s: have it made available but what we need
7615.48s: to do is we need to get this nine-person
7617.36s: panel assigned to have full staff and
7620.04s: funding which is all all proposing here
7622.48s: $22 million uh to be to be given to the
7625.76s: panel uh and this this we we're going to
7629.52s: we're going to get this passed again
7631.08s: this year uh Mike rounds uh uh in is is
7635.84s: in favor of this this this was actually
7638.12s: sponsored not only by by uh by uh
7641.84s: Schumer who was the majority leader of
7644.36s: the Senate at the time but Mike rounds
7647.44s: and also by uh by uh uh Rubio Marco
7652.12s: Rubio who's now the Secretary of State
7654.24s: yeah okay yeah so so we've got major
7656.92s: support at the top ranks of both
7659.32s: political parties in the Senate to get
7661.32s: this passed again and we rounds has now
7663.96s: assured us that he's he's going to
7665.48s: introduced and get this passed again and
7667.72s: we've also removed Turner Michael Turner
7670.92s: Who was the of the intelligence
7672.32s: Committee in the House of
7673.16s: Representatives who happens to come from
7675.00s: the 10th District of of Ohio where the
7677.68s: Wright Patterson Air Force Base is who
7680.24s: was sticking his thumb in our eye to
7682.24s: keep us from getting it to the floor
7684.16s: he's the one that talked Mike Johnson
7686.08s: the air T Speaker of the House you know
7689.68s: uh to not put this on the floor yeah
7692.08s: because it would pass yeah so we've now
7694.28s: gotten rid of Turner uh crr Shaw's there
7697.20s: now uh who I think is going to be
7699.16s: supportive of this bill people need to
7700.96s: know what's happen happening
7701.88s: historically this is going to blow
7703.56s: everything out of the water once this
7704.96s: gets that's right like I mean if as soon
7708.88s: as as soon as the the mechanism starts
7713.52s: you know working working yeah that's
7715.60s: right I mean it's going to be a
7717.52s: Floodgate yeah once it starts you know
7720.04s: this this is this is why the Aerospace
7722.40s: corporations are fighting this so
7724.00s: intensely because they want to get
7725.80s: patents on this they want to get secret
7727.88s: patents on all of this technology so
7730.44s: that we will have to to pay billions and
7732.52s: trillions of dollars to them over the
7734.72s: next hundred years to get access to what
7737.28s: they think is their technology uh and
7739.64s: this is not their technology this is
7741.64s: technology that's been recovered from
7743.44s: the crafts okay and this needs to be
7745.60s: made available to the people as a whole
7747.96s: you know that in the the the whatever
7751.60s: new inventions sources of energy techn
7755.32s: that this has to be made available for
7756.92s: people around the world because we need
7759.20s: to we need to not have this pass through
7762.56s: the lens of personal greed and profit
7765.24s: you know uh and so that that's so this
7768.32s: is this is what's happening right now uh
7770.68s: in that so that if if we can get if we
7772.80s: can get people to be willing to become
7774.80s: citizens for disclosure all they have to
7777.60s: do is go to new paradigm
7780.40s: institute.org and just sign up to be a
7785.08s: member of the citizens for disclosure in
7787.12s: your geographic area we will then get
7790.52s: all the information to you for free
7793.16s: about what are the what are the judical
7796.00s: uh institutions in your area what
7798.64s: province do you belong to what what
7800.32s: district are you in who are your elected
7802.52s: representatives that you need to go and
7804.04s: talk to what are the kind of what are
7806.00s: the newspapers you can write a letter to
7807.76s: the editor you know what are the local
7809.64s: television channels that you can go on
7811.52s: to you know uh what are the podcasts
7814.16s: that you want to come on to and what
7815.84s: what can you say yeah and and and you
7817.68s: need to know the information it's like
7820.08s: homework but the reality is this is
7823.08s: something 99% of the people when you
7825.72s: talk to them once they gr the fact that
7829.00s: this is true and they've gotten past
7831.12s: that block you know that has been
7833.32s: imposed on them by a major scops
7835.28s: operation that was going on and you know
7837.32s: and Richard Dolan who wrote the UFOs in
7840.12s: the National Security State he's got the
7842.24s: documents right there that he's
7843.80s: extracted under the Freedom of
7845.28s: Information Act that shows that this was
7847.20s: a conscious scops operation that was
7850.20s: going on by the American people yeah
7852.60s: against the American people to convince
7854.68s: them that this isn't true and anybody
7856.44s: who believes this is mentally ill mhm
7858.64s: and they've destroyed the lives of
7860.28s: hundreds of people you know uh and
7862.76s: ruined their careers and and uh and and
7866.00s: forced people into committing
7869.52s: suicide they're they're in such despair
7872.36s: over over being blocked they're in their
7874.80s: full professional career in the military
7877.36s: for example uh and they despair so much
7880.52s: of the the failure of our constitution
7883.56s: to get this information to our people
7886.12s: that they give up on life you know and
7888.32s: so that we are now at a stage right now
7890.44s: where we're we're going to be in the
7892.36s: next this four-year term of of uh of uh
7896.68s: president Trump we're going to get these
7899.20s: statutes passed we're going to get these
7900.80s: statutes passed right this year okay
7903.68s: that our new paradigm Institute is one
7906.44s: of the groups that is going to be
7908.16s: nominating people to this nine-person
7910.76s: panel
7912.20s: so we actually get to nominate people uh
7915.40s: so if people want to participate in that
7917.60s: process I mean we're they're going to
7920.16s: freak out over in the Senate say oh a
7921.64s: new paradigm insute is going to want
7922.96s: take a poll you know to see who they
7924.76s: want to nominate we thought we could
7926.04s: have some inside you know work but you
7928.44s: know I want to have the people involved
7930.32s: in this whole process you know uh and
7932.72s: and hopefully I'll be able to help show
7935.84s: the the representatives don't have to be
7938.16s: afraid of the people yeah you know they
7939.96s: don't have to be afraid of the people
7941.24s: that we're going to do kooky things okay
7944.00s: but at the same time we have to show
7945.88s: that we're not we're not stupid we
7947.80s: aren't going to sit around waiting for
7949.32s: the same people who've been lying to us
7950.88s: for 75 years to all of a sudden reform
7954.68s: so we're going to be reaching out
7956.12s: directly to the ET people through c5s
7961.12s: you know to sit and have conversations
7963.04s: with them to try to solicit them coming
7965.56s: uh to to talk with us as silly as that
7968.96s: sounds doesn't sound silly at all you
7970.72s: know no but that's what we're doing yeah
7973.08s: I think it's very Noble and I think it
7974.68s: takes a lot of guts uh on the contrary I
7977.16s: think uh I think it takes way more
7978.68s: courage
7979.76s: to you know speak of this publicly in
7983.04s: this
7984.32s: um in today's day and age I mean it's
7987.84s: it's so easy to come up with false
7992.44s: information to discredit things it's
7994.40s: very very easy in the age of AI and
7996.52s: everything else I know you know that's
7999.24s: why again I think it's really important
8001.24s: that you that you were here that you're
8003.48s: talking about this because someone like
8006.00s: you who's in it for the Public's
8007.76s: interest and that has been clear by your
8010.20s: record by you know your incredible
8013.04s: career it's been proven time and time
8015.08s: again that you are fighting for
8017.08s: transparency yeah and that's something
8019.88s: that I think everyone can get behind um
8022.60s: you know people are drawn to
8024.32s: authenticity they're drawn to
8025.80s: vulnerability even if they don't know it
8028.24s: you know it's the reason they watch live
8029.68s: streamers and it's the reason they watch
8031.16s: watch quote unquote reality TV and uh
8034.28s: people want to see people being
8036.76s: vulnerable they want to see them being
8038.08s: open but it takes someone who's brave
8039.92s: enough to be vulnerable first right you
8042.24s: know and then it takes someone even more
8043.84s: Brave to be vulnerable second it's you
8046.04s: know that um you know like seeing
8048.16s: someone on the dance floor right you
8050.12s: know you see the first person dancing is
8051.88s: brave but who's more Brave is the second
8053.92s: person who joins him yeah because the
8055.96s: first person could just be insane
8057.68s: showing off right but the second person
8059.88s: it takes a lot of Courage there to step
8062.44s: in and so you know it's but once you get
8065.20s: the ball rolling all of a sudden
8066.32s: everyone's dancing and that's uh I think
8068.40s: that's the goal is to to show strength
8070.88s: within numbers through these podcasts
8073.24s: these conversations and these
8074.88s: demonstrations that you're doing I think
8076.60s: is uh is really and and and part of the
8078.52s: key is getting people to to start to
8081.44s: trust each other that have for various
8084.12s: silly reasons well I don't want to be
8086.32s: demeaning but you know that for reasons
8088.28s: that I think can be overcome MH that
8091.28s: they don't talk to each other that they
8093.68s: view themselves as adversaries they they
8096.20s: start to demonize the other side they
8098.36s: try to figure out any one thing they've
8099.84s: said that wasn't potentially correct and
8101.96s: attacking them for it what we got to do
8104.20s: is demonstrate that we can overcome
8107.20s: those kind of uh false dialectics among
8109.96s: ourselves uh and then we Merit attention
8113.44s: from the ET people say oh good the
8115.80s: people are getting it now they're
8116.88s: starting to come together to really come
8118.80s: up with some intelligent protocol to to
8121.88s: govern their relationships with us and
8124.40s: keep us to try to stop our UFOs from
8127.04s: getting shot down yeah you know by these
8129.60s: National Security State people or
8130.88s: hijacked or pulled in yeah or pulled in
8133.24s: so that that's the so the just have
8135.20s: people go to if you want new paradigm
8137.16s: institute.org uh sign up to become
8140.00s: members of citizens for disclosure we'll
8142.44s: get all the information to you for free
8144.64s: uh send you answer your questions uh you
8147.32s: know we're we're and we're getting
8149.24s: contributions 51 C3 free tax some
8151.88s: contributions so we can provide this
8154.04s: stuff to you for free you know not
8155.72s: charging anybody for it uh and uh and
8158.72s: this is we're going to show that I think
8160.36s: we can get this done in this fouryear
8162.76s: period yeah I'm willing to help in any
8164.64s: capacity I think it's I think it's great
8166.24s: and thank you for um thank you for
8168.20s: offering and and you know coming here
8170.60s: and uh presenting this because I think
8172.64s: yeah if I have a chance to make even a
8175.24s: small difference you know that and you
8177.72s: know perhaps one that's greater than
8180.68s: just even having a YouTube channel which
8183.52s: which for me is just for fun almost but
8185.68s: it you know it moves the needle like it
8187.32s: or not yeah um but this in in a more
8190.08s: official capacity I think it would bring
8191.56s: me great uh pleasure to take part in it
8193.64s: so yeah definitely Count Me In way cool
8196.00s: yeah um I want to get to so now you got
8197.88s: questions that's your first question
8200.04s: okay there there's question number one
8202.76s: glad we got that out of the way uh I've
8205.12s: got quite quite a few here but I'm I
8207.60s: probably won't get to uh all of them up
8209.44s: to you you got as much time as you want
8211.12s: all right well heck with it let's go
8212.68s: through the whole thing um we got we did
8214.72s: we did actually answer quite a few um
8217.32s: and we also have some questions from the
8218.88s: interns which we'll get to on this
8220.64s: little diddy behind me sure
8223.96s: um I got something uh Jesse turn me on
8227.80s: to something Jesse and Michaels he said
8229.48s: ask him about the alstein alien
8233.16s: interview no that's that's the that's
8236.04s: that's the wolf Oscar wolf so you got
8237.56s: wrong okay okay cuz I was like I was
8239.84s: like another one that's that's Oscar
8242.32s: well great um if you had full authority
8245.76s: to subpoena anyone or any person or any
8249.52s: entity who would it be which entity or
8252.68s: which person would you go
8259.04s: after let me see who the who the first
8262.12s: one would be that we would go
8264.76s: after
8268.96s: uh what what will you do was first that
8272.20s: as is when you do the litigation you go
8274.92s: for the documents first mhm then you go
8277.72s: for the people okay so that what we
8280.16s: would do is we would go to subpoena the
8282.32s: black budget documents all the black
8284.68s: budget documents uh for the past uh and
8288.08s: and the all the current black budget
8290.60s: documents these These are the uh
8293.68s: unacknowledged uh uh special Access
8296.04s: program waved
8297.60s: waved unacknowledged special access
8300.48s: program s okay and now there's a there's
8303.28s: a person that's coming on board now in
8305.36s: the new
8306.56s: Administration who is going to have
8309.36s: access through the Office of Management
8311.56s: and budget uh to the black black budget
8315.64s: uh so those are the docu they they want
8317.72s: to have subpoena power to get the to get
8320.40s: all of those records uh you follow the
8322.64s: money and uh and track this down where
8325.08s: that money is gone to what private
8326.92s: contractors have got it you know what
8329.04s: what they were covering uh in then you
8331.28s: start to get into those private
8332.68s: Aerospace corporations and issue
8334.28s: subpoenas to them to come in and provide
8337.00s: the information that that they're going
8338.36s: to have that you know locked Martin and
8341.52s: grummond merer Patel yeah you start
8345.56s: going after those corporations and
8347.72s: extracting those documents from they're
8349.64s: going to fight and scream and holler
8351.04s: there Trade Secrets and all that stuff
8353.64s: but we're going for them and if you get
8355.44s: to the black budget you can see the
8356.96s: front-end contracts you know and what
8359.36s: they were assigned to work on
8361.40s: uh so that's so we go for the documents
8363.76s: first names come after yeah names come
8365.76s: after organically yeah you follow you
8367.12s: follow you follow the track that's you
8369.92s: know it's it's kind of what happened
8371.76s: didn't they like the Wilson during the
8373.48s: Wilson Davis memo I mean that's
8374.88s: something that you heard about too
8376.44s: whereas Admiral Wilson went in there and
8378.60s: he was knocking on doors and he was like
8380.28s: is this stuff true or whatever and he
8382.16s: was told by a private Corporation guy
8384.48s: that like yeah yeah uh in fact they were
8388.04s: audited or something and and one of the
8390.04s: people looking into these black budgets
8392.20s: saw something he shouldn't have and they
8393.80s: had to they had to read him they had to
8395.24s: read him into the project yep and that's
8397.76s: why they sort of upped their security in
8399.48s: the amount of people that were read in
8401.52s: right after that so that that was almost
8403.80s: certainly Ben rice that he talked to
8406.48s: over at locky Martin you know because
8409.16s: because Ben rice had talked to a number
8411.36s: of people you know from his class uh
8415.56s: that he graduated with about what they
8417.96s: really had wow and some of that leaked
8419.84s: out uh you know and so that that's that
8423.04s: those are that's how we would go that
8424.68s: when you're really doing the practice of
8427.40s: going after these things you know enough
8429.00s: you go for the documents first you go
8430.56s: for the people that are in charge of the
8431.96s: documents you then pull start pulling
8433.84s: the names out of the documents and then
8435.80s: you figure out who they're lay oning
8437.36s: with over inside the government and then
8439.56s: you go for them and then you go up the
8441.32s: chain because you follow the money you
8443.56s: automatically have paper trail that's
8445.24s: right right that is right so you have a
8447.00s: fingerprint mhm so that's that's way
8449.60s: that not only we would do it that is the
8451.20s: way we're going to do it yeah once we
8453.28s: get the subpoena power you know and this
8455.68s: task force doesn't have subpoena power
8457.32s: now that that uh James uh comr has said
8460.68s: that he will be willing to issue
8462.48s: subpoenas to them they've only got six
8464.96s: months uh first and we then have to get
8467.96s: it renewed but we're going to go after
8471.12s: uh if if we can get the panel assigned
8475.08s: uh the nine-person panel they'll work in
8477.40s: direct linkage with this task force over
8480.00s: in the house
8481.12s: and then the key will be is to get
8482.52s: funding if they get the $22 million to
8485.08s: bring on staff uh the key is they're
8487.24s: going to have to have a really strong
8488.60s: and aggressive general counsel to to run
8491.52s: that investigation you know someone with
8493.76s: proven track record that they're not
8495.16s: going to stop you know uh it makes it a
8497.72s: lot easier once this gets passed as well
8499.32s: right that's right yeah no no because
8501.00s: and and what we want to do is we don't
8502.72s: we don't want to have it depend
8505.08s: completely upon decisions that are made
8506.88s: inside the executive branch you know by
8509.04s: either either Trump himself any of his
8511.12s: cabinet members we want to have this the
8513.32s: Congress involved in it you know uh so
8515.84s: that the people can have access to it
8517.04s: that's right and and one of the subp The
8519.00s: subpoena power in this particular bill
8521.44s: it's kind of an esoteric point but the
8523.48s: subpoena power that the nine-person
8525.00s: panel would have would have to go
8527.04s: through the justice department that even
8529.44s: though it's a it's a and it's appointed
8531.44s: by the president but what they would do
8533.20s: is they go to the attorney
8535.08s: general to get the Attorney General to
8538.00s: file an application with the judicial
8540.08s: branch
8541.24s: to get the judicial branch to issue a
8543.52s: subpoena so that if in fact they didn't
8546.04s: anybody didn't comply with a subpoena
8547.64s: they could be held in contempt of court
8549.44s: right and arrested okay arrested uh and
8552.40s: and put in jail for contempt until they
8554.48s: give him the documents so that we would
8556.52s: have the Executive Branch the
8557.88s: legislative branch and the the judicial
8560.28s: branch all working together to get this
8563.20s: done uh that's that's part of the genius
8565.68s: of this particular Bill uh and and we've
8568.56s: gotten insurances but from rounds that
8571.60s: uh that we I I haven't talked to uh uh
8575.20s: what's it said from South Dakota th you
8577.52s: know who's the new the new uh majority
8580.20s: leader in the in the Senate but uh I'm
8582.72s: I'm sure he's a company man you know for
8585.64s: the Republican party and so he'll he'll
8587.44s: go along with this too and and I'm and
8589.56s: I'm sure that Rubio is going to be
8591.32s: supportive of it over in State
8592.68s: Department uh Tully uh tulsy gabard is
8596.20s: going to be supportive of it over in the
8598.96s: the the national uh the Director of
8601.72s: National and ratliffe is going to be
8603.96s: supportive of it the head of the CIA so
8606.32s: we we've gotten these people on board
8608.16s: already over the period of time we've
8610.12s: been working uh and get everybody going
8612.44s: in the same direction and get Congress
8614.44s: involved in it the task force involved
8616.28s: in it the panel established and then
8618.76s: it's going to start coming loose do you
8620.36s: think there's ever been a time in
8622.16s: history that we've been this close to
8625.52s: such a big moment of disclosure no this
8628.68s: is this is this is the moment there
8630.60s: wasn't um totally unique you know cuz
8632.72s: cuz we did go through you know I think
8636.56s: obviously not not to this extent but
8638.48s: there there have been steps in the past
8640.04s: to yeah but the they're all Insider I
8643.00s: mean they're they're for example Hal pu
8645.68s: off talks about the instance back under
8648.08s: Bush W that uh they they were all
8651.12s: convened that uh that uh Jay Stratton
8654.96s: you know called them all together there
8656.52s: were about a dozen of the guys that were
8658.24s: all on the inside on this thing and they
8660.44s: had this weekend long set of meetings uh
8663.92s: broke into small groups and and and all
8666.56s: voted to say they tried to measure what
8668.60s: the positives were of releasing the
8670.44s: information and the negatives and much
8672.84s: to their surprise every single one of
8674.84s: the little small groups came out to the
8676.56s: negative that we weren't ready to
8678.76s: release it and of course the reason that
8680.24s: we aren't ready is because they're still
8682.00s: pretending it isn't true right and so
8683.80s: nobody's working on what do we do in
8685.40s: light of the fact it's true because
8686.92s: they're still being told it isn't true
8688.24s: so they're not going to waste their time
8690.04s: answering questions in the abstract so
8692.80s: frustrating that that argument is still
8694.96s: yeah still there even being used and
8696.72s: being bought y by by most everyone it is
8699.64s: so our our job is to is to educate the
8702.48s: people and then the the leaders are
8704.96s: going to say oh rats you know the people
8708.64s: now know we've been outed we're going to
8710.92s: have to do
8712.08s: something are you are you working or
8714.36s: have you worked with anyone with direct
8715.72s: contact with nhi that's had some ongoing
8719.28s: contact with nhi you had any success in
8721.28s: that because you mentioned C5 they say
8723.36s: they are they say they are I still need
8725.48s: to vet them and uh you know well we're
8728.48s: going to put them on psych psychological
8730.44s: stress evaluator right you know we're
8732.36s: going to run them on PS run them on psse
8734.56s: that's for forthcoming yes yeah because
8737.28s: you know I'm not just going to take
8738.32s: somebody's position saying oh you know
8739.72s: I'm picking up messages of Mars on my M
8742.48s: civilians some of them okay so some of
8744.80s: them some of them not civilians some of
8746.48s: them are are civilians now right but
8749.64s: they weren't they had some type of
8751.24s: clearance yeah and so we we have to also
8753.64s: provide legal representation for them so
8756.04s: if they get attacked or are you able to
8758.28s: say if these people um if their jobs had
8761.60s: something to do with with that yeah they
8764.24s: did yeah so their supposed contact with
8768.60s: nhi
8770.08s: was part of their job they they they've
8773.96s: been uh recruited to participate in uh
8779.08s: setting up protocols for this Honey Trap
8781.60s: operation right like interloper yeah
8784.52s: that that even though Lou talked about
8786.88s: it in his book and sort of well that one
8788.68s: didn't work well the fact is they have
8790.80s: worked I I suspect it as much yeah they
8792.84s: have worked you know and they've done
8794.76s: them and they've they've actually
8796.88s: captured uh craft pursuant to that
8799.52s: program kind of like what Jak Jake
8801.04s: Barber was a part of well Jak Jake is
8804.48s: anyway Jake people don't quite get this
8807.32s: with Jake I think you know the if he's
8809.80s: on the ring range M you know the the
8812.16s: north grummond range and he's picking up
8815.40s: craft from the range those are not you
8818.60s: know willy-nilly crashes those are not
8820.92s: crashes of of some UFO that's been kind
8823.92s: of lured in these are in their
8825.84s: possession already I see okay so the
8828.32s: this whole question of them luring them
8830.24s: in and capturing them which they purport
8833.00s: to have done uh it would seemed to me
8835.96s: that it wouldn't take long for the ET
8837.52s: people to get get on that yeah saying
8839.84s: you know oh it's those people again you
8841.76s: know I want you to come and you know
8844.52s: yeah they aren't fish yeah so so so
8846.80s: right you know once once they've shaking
8848.40s: the hook you know they they won't bite
8850.60s: again you know so that that the what we
8853.24s: have to do is find people that are that
8855.16s: are trained at this and know what
8856.92s: they're doing uh and and set up a set of
8860.92s: coordinated protocols for people to
8862.88s: follow you know that uh but we don't we
8865.44s: don't want to overdo it we don't want to
8867.12s: pretend like we're some centralized
8868.72s: authorizing group that oh you an
8870.44s: authoriz C we're not into that but what
8873.48s: what we want to do is get people that
8875.04s: are responsible that aren't going to get
8877.00s: infiltrated that aren't going to you
8878.56s: know you know be suckered into you know
8881.52s: genuinely luring in one of the things
8883.16s: than having somebody jump on you you
8885.12s: know unbeknown to knock the thing down
8887.96s: you know we have to be careful about
8889.68s: this is there any is there anything in
8892.36s: this
8893.32s: protocol
8894.88s: that um that is new that you guys are
8898.00s: trying out or is that something you you
8899.76s: want to hold on to no the the there
8902.20s: there are some very basic things that
8904.24s: have been a meditative sort of yeah
8906.96s: they're very that's that's how it's
8908.44s: experienced yeah the the access that
8911.20s: most human beings have to this
8914.24s: particular phenomenon is through what
8917.28s: they call meditation but you but you
8919.44s: have even Transcendental Meditation that
8921.76s: is not sectarian it's not Buddhist or
8924.20s: Hindu or or any of the other ones it's a
8927.32s: it's a particular exercise uh you know
8930.32s: and it's it's a it's a scientific thing
8933.92s: you know it's like doing push-ups in
8935.48s: growing muscles yeah you know or or
8937.72s: lifting weights and and bulking up you
8940.16s: know this is you're bulking up your
8941.96s: capacity to actually have this kind of
8943.96s: telepathic uh reach to communicate with
8946.52s: beings and they're people that are very
8948.48s: very accomplished at this you know and
8950.96s: so that we're in communication with them
8952.88s: they've reached out to us that we have
8955.12s: uh over
8956.88s: 1,500 volunteers now that have actually
8960.72s: written to us contacted us at the new
8962.88s: paradigm Institute offering Services of
8965.60s: various kinds they're lawyers and
8968.32s: professors at universities some of them
8970.48s: are remote viewers uh some of them are
8973.48s: experienced past military people
8976.76s: abductees yes M yeah we we have a whole
8979.56s: group of abduct we have a whole group of
8981.60s: experiencer uh category of the people
8984.32s: which we're going to be organizing we're
8986.24s: organizing the experiencers as a an
8989.04s: entire specialized
8991.00s: group of talent are you in the process
8993.48s: is this like are we still in the vetting
8995.16s: process here yes with all of these
8997.04s: people have there have there been any
8999.32s: that have been vetted successfully mhm
9002.44s: that you're 100% certain of their
9004.96s: ability or their story I'm not yet CU I
9007.04s: haven't put them on the psse I haven't
9008.88s: put on the psychological stress Val they
9011.12s: most of them view that as an insult uh
9013.32s: I'd say well that's too bad for you yeah
9015.36s: uh you know because I've I've seen the
9017.32s: psse work and so I know that it does uh
9020.36s: and so that we've got extremely expert
9023.28s: uh psse operators that can track track
9026.96s: the questions you know that's not just
9028.92s: to have an original set of like 20
9031.72s: questions or 25 questions and then once
9034.56s: they can track put the responses right
9036.80s: it's all vocal cord tensions and and you
9039.20s: know they've nobody's been able to train
9041.12s: anybody to beat it right so we can we're
9044.08s: that's what we're going to be using
9045.76s: that's a that's a great amount of uh
9047.72s: rigor which is is great to hear again
9050.60s: you know um there's people out there
9052.52s: what we want we want no BS anymore you
9054.96s: know and I'm sure a lot of those people
9058.04s: who reached out to you you know even if
9060.32s: they're not aware of it it could be BS
9062.56s: you know sometimes we're easily tricked
9064.28s: as well into thinking that there might
9065.68s: be something more when it's a natural
9067.24s: phenomenon or sleep paralysis or
9069.20s: whatever it is we'll see yeah we'll see
9071.40s: yeah because because the key is is to
9073.28s: have civilian uh operated uh tests like
9078.16s: this in vetting people and you know the
9080.76s: the the pro the the problem with the
9082.44s: National Security State mentality is
9084.84s: that they the minute that they start
9087.28s: discovering Talent like this they bring
9089.16s: them in and put them under National
9090.80s: Security restrictions and prohibitions
9093.60s: and threaten them and everything else
9095.64s: you know said now you're one of us
9096.88s: you're on the inside you can't talk to
9098.40s: anybody about it you have to lie to your
9099.84s: neighbors you know we're not into that
9102.28s: yeah we're not into that the new parad
9104.24s: Institute is a completely different
9105.84s: approach to this thing yeah it seems
9107.64s: like a breath of fresh air especially
9109.32s: considering like
9110.56s: um reaching
9112.00s: nhi in my mind there's two ways of going
9114.76s: about it there's simulating war yeah
9119.04s: right yeah right or there's like
9120.44s: meditation and it's like an an equal and
9123.00s: opposite probably uh you know yeah lure
9126.84s: exactly because I'm sure they both work
9128.80s: yeah yeah and I'm sure you know the
9130.56s: military is you know much more obviously
9134.56s: prepared and gung-ho about creating a
9137.92s: war scenario and I'm sure a lot of
9139.52s: soldiers out there probably you know
9142.08s: would have a much better time in that
9143.84s: scenario because they're that's what
9145.20s: they're trained for and kind of what
9146.72s: they you know hope to get into a lot of
9148.24s: them except for after their career
9150.12s: exactly yeah but a lot of times that's
9153.04s: you know like these scenarios and stuff
9154.80s: is is uh is exciting and you know this
9157.52s: and that there's money and there's
9158.72s: things that get to blow up and like it's
9160.24s: all cool but but also like what are we
9163.52s: doing here yeah you what are we
9165.92s: signaling see look at this that we're in
9168.52s: the next fouryear period we're getting
9170.80s: set to lay the groundwork for
9173.16s: establishing the protocols that are
9175.20s: going to govern our relationship with
9176.88s: this extraterrestrial civilization for
9179.04s: the next 10,000 years I mean people in
9182.32s: the future are going to look back on
9184.84s: this
9186.64s: conversation today uh and others that
9189.72s: are taking place now during this period
9192.16s: of time as to how did this happen how
9195.16s: did we succeed in establishing a
9197.92s: positive and constructive mut beneficial
9200.80s: relationship with the civilization or
9204.04s: not H worth a shot you know uh and and
9208.44s: so that's what that we're in people
9210.32s: people aren't used to being part of
9212.72s: History you know that I've just been
9215.24s: very very fortunate people aren't used
9217.48s: to being part of history is a wild thing
9220.28s: to contemplate they're just not and and
9222.56s: that they they they freak out you know
9225.44s: over being even near a
9227.24s: celebrity and and it's in in the problem
9229.84s: is they've been trained to you know keep
9232.52s: their place like that yeah you know uh
9235.24s: and uh but but the the fact is the
9238.20s: people that are now alive are given the
9241.44s: opportunity to participate in this
9243.96s: absolute Watershed event of History okay
9247.92s: and they can be part of the history that
9250.52s: is getting set to be written okay and
9253.40s: and I know they're not used to it uh but
9256.36s: they will get used to it you know is
9258.76s: there um
9261.08s: do you because like I mean I you know
9263.36s: when I post these videos and people
9265.08s: start commenting and some people uh seem
9268.00s: to vocalize a bit of hesitancy or at
9271.84s: least the they advise to practice a bit
9275.32s: of restraint when trying to communicate
9277.68s: with nhi because they say you don't know
9279.60s: what it is you're communicating with are
9281.88s: you are you saying everybody should just
9285.04s: try in their own right to do this or
9287.32s: like no i' I'd be care the
9290.64s: a lot a lot of the
9293.60s: the a lot of this let's back up a little
9296.60s: bit sure the
9299.68s: the reality that is being revealed to us
9303.24s: in this process is that there is a a
9307.60s: field of possibilities that we're bathed
9312.84s: in uh in the the choices that you make
9316.48s: in the next
9318.16s: microsecond uh into to what they call
9320.76s: collapsing the wave function of the all
9323.36s: the different opportunities and
9325.08s: directing your intention into the field
9328.20s: to collapse the wave field of
9330.64s: probabilities and possibilities into a
9332.84s: particular certainty is how reality
9336.16s: happens okay uh and so that if if you
9339.40s: bring to this experience uh a fear uh a
9344.48s: concern that you know that these are
9346.68s: diabolical entities out there or demon
9349.64s: humans or satanic beings something like
9352.76s: that if you do that you're you're
9355.08s: bringing that aspect of potential
9357.96s: reality uh into play okay and so that uh
9362.08s: people need to be extraordinarily
9363.96s: careful not to go treading into that I
9366.76s: remember Father Bill Davis who the the
9369.88s: Jesuit the Jesuits have this this saying
9371.80s: you know you know yes I've gone through
9373.68s: all the Jesuit training and I've now
9375.28s: been ordained and I still believe sort
9378.76s: of you know and what it is is that you
9382.28s: you've really by the time you get done
9383.92s: with the 12 15E period of uh being
9387.24s: trained as a as a Jesuit uh you know
9390.28s: you've come to disassemble uh the kind
9393.16s: of uh uh
9395.48s: simpleminded uh childlike uh mythologies
9399.44s: that you've been exposed to uh that have
9401.88s: led you to want to be a priest some
9404.48s: people right and you've had
9406.40s: counterproductive almost you you've had
9408.12s: that stuff disassembled for you uh and
9411.12s: that if you have an adequate faith in
9413.48s: there that there's there is sense this
9416.64s: makes sense that there's kindness in the
9419.08s: universe and that you you maintain that
9421.52s: Faith through and you start to discern
9424.16s: the the pieces that come together to
9426.40s: form a different pattern of reality and
9429.24s: you come to see oh lo and behold it
9431.60s: turns out that there was an essential
9433.56s: truth hidden in that whole kind of
9436.00s: childlike mythology and you really
9438.44s: understand that that most of those
9440.28s: premises that were set forth were done
9442.68s: when 99% of the people were completely
9444.84s: illiterate we were talking about this
9446.24s: last night you know that you know they
9447.92s: they didn't even go more than 50 miles
9450.08s: away from the place that they were born
9451.96s: you know you know back you know we're
9453.64s: talking 2,000 years ago you you know
9455.88s: we're talking about the the treaties of
9457.68s: you know the various treaties with when
9459.40s: they came to get the councils of NAA and
9461.76s: others you know these these doctrines
9463.96s: were were solidified uh back at a time
9467.20s: when those who had the rare opportunity
9469.56s: to be adequately educated to be able to
9471.44s: formulate those kind of doctrines you
9473.60s: know we're dealing with people that were
9475.76s: were completely
9477.40s: illiterate uh and they they had to be uh
9480.64s: they had to have things communicated to
9482.28s: them in very simplistic reductionist
9485.08s: forms in order for them to grock them at
9488.36s: all and we've and what happens is
9491.48s: institutions uh you know aify uh and
9494.24s: they say locked on those things that old
9496.68s: mistaking the road map for the the road
9499.72s: right yeah you know uh and so the the
9502.08s: part of the role of the Jesuit order is
9505.08s: at least since uh Pedro rupe came on as
9508.16s: the as the superior General back in 1962
9511.32s: is to to undertake a genuine Reformation
9514.40s: of the church you know uh into into get
9517.20s: down to getting ready for the 21st
9519.08s: century of of what's been discovered
9521.64s: because he came in after the discovery
9524.04s: of quantum physics and and the the whole
9526.64s: question of the reality uh of how human
9531.04s: consciousness participates in the
9533.76s: process of collapsing the wave field the
9537.00s: wave function the wave function into
9538.84s: into reality and so this this is you
9541.96s: know not something to be toyed with uh
9544.96s: but the fact the matter is we that's
9547.32s: part of what we're doing as a new
9548.44s: paradigm ins go into it with a
9550.44s: loving a loving intention and faith in
9554.20s: the goodness of the universe right in
9556.28s: the goodness of other sentient beings uh
9558.80s: and in the goodness the basic goodness
9560.88s: of every human being uh almost no matter
9563.64s: what the condition is they find
9565.24s: themselves in that there's a there's a
9567.52s: conscious person being in there that is
9571.48s: innocent uh in wanting to believe and in
9575.80s: the goodness of the world and that's how
9577.92s: the goodness of the world Rises into
9580.04s: being you know uh and so we we have to
9583.40s: participate that's that's the kind of
9585.04s: faith that people have to have not the
9586.88s: faith in some white anthropomorphic
9588.76s: being sitting a throne somewhere out of
9590.68s: some medieval you know image that they
9592.92s: have you know but and not to be naive
9596.60s: about about the the kind of possib
9598.80s: people the people who have collapsed the
9600.36s: way function in different ways I mean i
9603.00s: s talk I sat talking to a judge one time
9605.16s: a state judge in Florida who was proud
9608.08s: of the fact that he had defended a
9611.52s: motorcycle gang that had kidnapped this
9614.52s: young woman who was hitchhiking on the
9616.32s: road and crucified her
9619.44s: uh and that he got them off you know and
9622.52s: I'm sitting here saying what am I
9623.92s: talking to this person for you know how
9626.48s: could anybody be proud of having done
9628.36s: something like that he was just proud of
9630.80s: you know his abilities his Fe an
9633.84s: accomplishment of some sort you know and
9635.76s: so there are there are people who who
9639.36s: who have
9642.64s: abilities to to through force of
9645.56s: personality and character and stuff can
9648.00s: can make things happen that are bad yeah
9650.32s: you know and the and when you encounter
9653.04s: those kind of people you you have to
9656.04s: really transcend the temptation to get
9659.24s: caught in their field of hating them you
9661.76s: know I and I've not always been
9663.60s: successful I remember I sat across the
9665.08s: table from the uh the Grand Dragon of
9667.76s: the KX clan of North Carolina that had
9670.40s: gunned down uh you know six uh you know
9673.48s: labor organizers who were trying to
9674.96s: organize a labor union in a textile mill
9677.92s: down in Greensboro North Carol Carolina
9680.04s: you know and he he came to the table the
9681.84s: deposition table and he had a pin with
9684.84s: six human skulls on it on his lapel for
9689.40s: the people that they had shot in the
9690.92s: head and killed who were demonstrating
9693.20s: on behalf of organizing a union in the
9695.04s: textile M you know and that then and I
9697.64s: said I said you know you know are those
9700.64s: what I think they are there and and he
9702.36s: said oh yes they are you know and he
9704.52s: started giving off all those kind of
9706.76s: Vibes that you know that uh when I
9708.92s: played linebacker in college I would
9710.60s: have knocked you down seriously you know
9714.44s: I would have loved to seen that but you
9716.32s: know I've I've transcended that yeah you
9718.28s: know I had this bad this bad experience
9720.76s: but when I was Chief trial Council for
9723.04s: ACLU in the rocky mountain region we we
9726.64s: actually uh got on the stand the
9728.36s: president of the uh State Board of
9730.68s: Education of the state of Idaho that had
9733.76s: terminated uh a one of our professors
9736.20s: that had tenure because he had stood up
9738.68s: in a PO
9739.72s: he opposed the it's a funny story I
9742.04s: should tell you Rufus Lyman his name was
9743.88s: he was the head of the life sciences
9745.24s: Department this guy at the Idaho State
9747.96s: University uh and uh uh the the
9751.80s: president of the Idaho State University
9754.72s: had died like a month and a half into
9757.04s: the next school term and so the Board of
9760.20s: Education appointed uh this guy Davis uh
9763.76s: who was the coach of the football team
9766.08s: that hadn't had a winning season in 12
9767.96s: years you know he became the acting
9770.52s: president and he started transferring
9772.40s: money out of the the uh the academic

10110.76s: said no I I I can see my way in we just
10113.08s: walk into the Attorney General's office

10131.60s: defendant you know in a conspiracy to
10134.00s: violate his first amendment rights okay
10136.56s: and so you're not going to defend him or
10139.28s: provide any attorney for him and so he
10141.60s: had to go out and hire the president of
10145.04s: this of the Board of Education had go
10147.04s: and hire and he hired Jess Holly III who
10150.12s: was the attorney general who had

10325.00s: next two guys the next two guys that
10328.12s: were scheduled report in to the court
10330.80s: that they both gone into the hospital
10332.60s: and had voluntary open heart surgery oh
10335.80s: they did I swear to God that's a true
10337.40s: story w and I didn't know if that's
10339.60s: something you could request yeah yeah
10341.56s: they they they said it's a voluntary
10343.16s: thing my doctor says I need to get some
10344.72s: coronary he's cleared out so so they
10347.12s: they go in and so that we move for
10349.04s: summary judgment we got the notes and
10350.68s: everything right so we move for summary
10352.48s: judgment against them we come into the
10353.84s: hearing and there's Jess Holly comes in
10356.20s: and so we come in and the judge the
10358.32s: judge looks over at the mall and says so
10360.72s: okay how are we this morning gentlemen
10362.52s: and no no heart problems here this
10364.24s: morning are there he said to them you
10365.96s: know so we got the summary J but since
10368.00s: then I said said to myself well know
10369.60s: that there was something wrong here you
10371.72s: know that somehow I had gotten myself
10374.00s: into a state of consciousness that I was
10376.52s: kind of justifying you know uh acting
10379.48s: that way toward him uh and had in a
10381.96s: certain sense dehumanized him to the
10383.92s: point where uh I didn't I not only
10386.28s: didn't mind that he was having a heart
10387.76s: attack you know I thought it was kind of
10390.00s: helpful for us you know to right
10392.40s: intimidate the rest of them how and so
10395.04s: that I realized you know that and so
10396.56s: that's when that's when I started
10398.64s: meditating oh wow turns out Joe durm who
10401.60s: was the general counsel for the ACLU and
10404.64s: that I was at ACLU National of the racky
10407.16s: Mountain Regional uh he was a Sufi
10410.12s: actually uh and that I was staying at
10412.64s: his house in Boulder Colorado uh and
10415.28s: they had this group that would come in
10416.68s: and do all these prayers so I said this
10418.32s: meditation thing I've heard a lot about
10419.84s: it and I should really try to figure out
10423.84s: what this is all about so I started
10426.20s: reading up on Transcendental Meditation
10428.12s: you know it's it's not any kind of
10429.12s: sectarian thing it's not Hindu Buddhist
10431.24s: so I started doing those meditations and
10433.84s: I discovered that I was there for a
10436.08s: whole year uh at that office doing that
10439.00s: and uh after a number of weeks of doing
10442.40s: this you know every morning and every
10444.08s: evening I started realizing that there
10446.36s: was this uh and of course I didn't
10448.44s: understand it to begin with what what
10450.56s: could happen was supposed to happen here
10452.56s: but I realized that I I finally got into
10455.16s: doing this chant uh that enabled you to
10459.36s: to actually breathe all the air out and
10461.72s: then breathe all the air in and that you
10463.84s: got into this kind of breath breath work
10466.08s: thing uh and that you would actually
10468.28s: start to ascend into this kind of State
10470.20s: of Consciousness that was it stopped all
10473.04s: the chitchat going on in your brain you
10475.04s: know this they call chichar yeah of
10477.52s: talking to yourself and uh and you get
10479.48s: into this kind of a space and then Sor I
10481.44s: started having this kind of amazing
10484.32s: feeling that here I am sitting in this
10486.56s: particular position that they advocate
10488.40s: you be in and I realized that that
10490.88s: people have been sitting in this exact
10493.20s: position for a thousand years you know
10496.44s: 2,000 years you know and uh and doing
10499.00s: this exact same and that they were
10501.28s: getting into this kind of state where
10502.72s: they started transcending uh the
10505.20s: particular vicissitudes of your own
10507.28s: particular Incarnation here your
10509.36s: particular culture and time and place
10511.52s: you know once you get past worrying
10512.76s: about you have to do the laundry you
10514.20s: have to you know go get the oil change
10516.84s: in your car you know and you you
10518.56s: transcend into this place of of kind of
10521.24s: no thoughts as such uh and all of a
10524.64s: sudden you start getting this this kind
10526.20s: of uh sense of perspective uh of of your
10529.52s: own of your own Consciousness uh and
10533.12s: that uh and I discovered that I started
10535.52s: it started uh causing me to be different
10539.92s: you know not be as aggressive not being
10542.16s: as uh it didn't resort to kind of
10544.60s: descending into these kind of lower
10546.16s: chakra energy centers you know in and
10548.44s: drawing my motivation from that kind of
10550.28s: stuff and uh and so that I really I I
10552.96s: really realized that this was this was
10555.00s: kind of really important that what we we
10557.40s: had discovered here uh and then
10559.44s: rediscovered yeah rediscovered and so
10561.92s: then then I ended up going back to do
10564.36s: the PHD work and I ended up uh studying
10567.56s: stuff at the Divinity School you know on
10570.12s: this this experience that people had
10572.36s: this metanoia type experience people
10574.72s: have and I started getting at it kind of
10576.96s: intellectually
10578.52s: and that's when I got approached by
10580.00s: father Roger coutur who had been the
10582.36s: professor at the Harvard Divinity School
10584.96s: actually at ETS the Episcopal
10586.60s: theological school um teaching the uh
10590.68s: the theological underpinnings of Human
10592.96s: Rights uh and I had written a number of
10595.68s: papers in the course and so he called me
10597.40s: in and said you know do you realize
10600.12s: what's happening now with the Jesuits
10602.28s: and I said uh what he said you know I
10604.44s: can tell from the papers that you were
10605.96s: writing that you must be Catholic you
10607.84s: know and I said said yeah Danny Sheen
10609.52s: you know I got a sister Colleen and a
10610.92s: brother Patty yeah right you know and so
10614.24s: so he said uh you know but the the uh
10617.00s: the Jesuits are all have all been all
10619.40s: the provincials all 100 provincials from
10621.28s: around the world have been called into
10623.16s: Rome uh uh by the by the uh uh Superior
10628.52s: General Pedro rupe uh in that they're
10631.56s: crafting a whole set of social justice
10633.68s: documents W uh saying that the Jesuit
10636.80s: order needs to devote itself to Bringing
10638.92s: about social justice actually the
10641.44s: deconstructing of all of the sinful
10644.24s: structures in both Western and Eastern
10647.52s: culture uh and they're looking for a a
10650.76s: legal counsel general counsel uh and
10653.40s: I've recommended you for and they want
10655.12s: you to come down and uh talk to them
10657.80s: about this and so that's what I did I
10660.00s: went down and and well actually I didn't
10662.56s: I actually went up to do the thing up
10664.36s: here the Mohawk thing about the fin and
10666.92s: Prime thing I told you and and Father
10669.04s: Bill Davis came all the way up from

10676.68s: six uh spiritual leaders of the uh of
10679.48s: the six Indian nations you know climbing
10682.84s: out of this this sweat father Davis was
10685.68s: standing right there waiting W so that
10689.12s: that's how I got recruited to G on and
10691.48s: become General C for the Jesuit
10692.96s: headquarters in their Social Ministry
10694.80s: Office which is important for this whole
10697.00s: issue it's a good perspective from which
10698.68s: to approach this in all of its
10701.00s: complexity in all of it political
10703.72s: ramifications all of its cultural
10705.56s: ramifications and very importantly in
10707.36s: all of its
10708.80s: theological implications of how we how
10711.76s: we integrate this extraordinary
10714.32s: information about our human
10715.96s: consciousness and its effect upon the
10718.68s: collapse of the wave function and the
10721.36s: mental telepathy and all of these things
10723.12s: that are involved you need to have to
10725.72s: make it nonsecular and make it you you
10727.56s: need need to have a a really whole
10731.12s: holistic perspective on this thing in
10733.60s: order to understand which is what we do
10735.64s: at the new paradigm Institute which is
10738.32s: um fantastic because of the amount of
10741.08s: myopic perspective that people have been
10743.24s: taking uh in their own through their own
10745.52s: research or through their own paradigms
10748.08s: has really led to conflict within you
10750.84s: know UFO communities and led to a lot of
10753.84s: obviously disagreement and it's so wild
10755.88s: because we're all looking for the same
10758.28s: thing we're all just looking for the
10759.84s: truth and you know we do get sometimes
10764.08s: because of so many different reasons
10765.56s: including your own personal history and
10767.68s: psychology and everything else we get
10768.84s: locked into like right this is this or
10771.92s: this is that it's just so good to have
10774.00s: an open worldview as you said and a
10776.28s: perspective you know that can really
10778.28s: Encompass every perspective like just as
10781.64s: much as humanly possible yeah uh Danny
10784.44s: we're going to get into some questions
10785.88s: here from the audience if you don't mind
10788.08s: sure all right so these are questions
10791.64s: from the interns or the operatives that
10793.92s: we have over at uh the people who are
10796.16s: going to be members of the citizens for
10797.84s: disclosure that's correct those would be
10799.52s: the people write right in soon to yeah
10802.08s: we have a lot of people there that are
10803.44s: very very involved every single day on
10805.64s: our Discord Channel having these
10807.08s: important conversations and yeah it's
10809.36s: truly great to see because uh with our
10811.24s: community moderators and everything else
10812.88s: we really uphold a
10815.68s: nice um platform to be a ble to
10819.16s: communicate respectfully with each other
10820.96s: while still no throwing rocks at each
10822.72s: other exactly and and Everyone's
10824.56s: entitled to their own opinions and you
10826.88s: know we have just a really good
10828.00s: discourse going on there so uh really
10830.48s: love it um so here we go this is the
10835.08s: first
10840.44s: question it's cool what is your favorite
10843.32s: bit of evidence that has convinced you
10845.24s: that we Are Not Alone by firemist oh I'm
10848.12s: it's the first one is the seeing the
10850.00s: photographs seeing the photographs
10851.72s: photographs in the classified portions
10853.28s: of Project Blue Book perfect yeah follow
10855.72s: followed by the photograph of Father
10857.44s: Davis yes that was all very very helpful
10860.60s: I will add on to that um a secondary
10862.92s: part of that question since it's already
10864.28s: been answered yeah have you ever seen
10867.08s: or have you ever seen evidence of nhi
10869.92s: through one a through a photo or video
10872.72s: no just the I I've seen half a dozen of
10876.40s: the purported photos
10878.56s: and stuff it's all the one that you had
10880.84s: last night uh that that these these all
10885.12s: require kind of intense scrutiny
10887.92s: scientific analysis of the photos Etc uh
10891.96s: in that I haven't uh I haven't seen any
10894.92s: of them yet that I have been able to
10897.80s: subject to the necessary scientific
10900.16s: verification to be convinced yet or a
10902.32s: lot of the examples that you're
10903.16s: mentioning are they from uh Greer from
10905.52s: Dr Greer some are from Greer yeah yeah
10907.60s: she has some interesting ones uh a lot
10909.68s: of uh light related beings and and that
10911.92s: type of thing during C5 that's right you
10913.84s: know a couple of them you know running
10915.12s: through the shrubs you know that that
10917.32s: famous one yeah uh and uh you know
10920.12s: there's uh uh was the
10923.76s: beu I don't know one floating around
10927.32s: yeah I've seen a handful of these yeah
10929.48s: yeah nothing nothing that's convinced me
10931.48s: yet okay yeah fair enough and in very
10933.56s: speci there's a couple of these alleged
10936.00s: interrogations of of ETS that are being
10939.36s: you know browbeaten in
10941.92s: course I I I haven't been convinced of
10944.72s: those things neither I I hav have not
10946.12s: been convinced okay next
10953.80s: question fun right this is cool it's
10956.92s: like the old train station yeah I know
10959.04s: I've seen it in the Grand Central yeah
10961.40s: yeah if you had three questions for a
10963.72s: non-human being what would you ask by
10966.48s: maverickstar
10967.96s: well if if I were assuming that they
10970.56s: were extraterrestrial correct uh I would
10974.48s: uh I would ask them you know
10978.12s: what is it that they think about the
10982.92s: potential existence of an infinite and
10985.44s: eternal sea of completely
10987.68s: undifferentiated Consciousness that
10990.32s: surrounds uh our material Universe uh
10994.20s: and its relationship to the the condens
10997.96s: ation of Consciousness into our material
11000.44s: realm what do they think about that
11003.64s: H that's number one well deep that's
11007.40s: that's number one uh number two I would
11010.04s: ask them you know uh what what was the
11013.20s: process by means of which they actually
11016.12s: overcame their age of nuclear weapons or
11020.20s: some totally self-destructive weapon
11022.88s: system that they had in their culture uh
11026.04s: what was the process by means of which
11027.96s: they overcame it and how many tries did
11030.36s: it take yeah of of reestablishing their
11033.68s: culture and and succeeding in the one
11036.60s: that he comes from now great question
11038.72s: that would be the that would be the the
11040.32s: first one uh and secondly I would ask
11042.84s: him is you know what is the what is the
11046.92s: uh juridical entity if any uh of which
11050.36s: they're a part uh with the different
11052.32s: species with whom it would be important
11054.92s: to communicate to try to get a process
11058.08s: going where there's a a uh a a a a a set
11062.64s: of protocols with adequate authorization
11065.44s: or authority to govern their all their
11068.28s: species what what does that look like I
11071.68s: love this it you know in my mind I'm
11074.28s: imagining you um sort of deposing one of
11077.44s: these
11078.68s: nhi in in in some type of Galactic
11082.16s: courtroom uh you know and getting to
11084.68s: getting to ask inquire who do we talk to
11086.28s: who do we have to subpoena to to you
11088.60s: know the grand nhi here what's going on
11091.16s: right give me them documents yeah
11094.12s: wonderful wonderful
11096.16s: answer uh this one here is from
11104.96s: Hara Hara asks how long have you known
11108.76s: about the relationship between psionics
11110.92s: and the
11111.88s: phenomenon
11113.40s: ah about
11118.24s: a year and a half that
11121.36s: recent about the term the term psionics
11124.60s: psionics itself I mean I've I've known
11127.08s: about this issue of tath telepathic
11129.80s: communication and I knew about all the
11132.28s: way up to the uh the uh craft themselves
11136.64s: being apparently conscious in some way
11140.24s: some kind of Consciousness and that was
11142.92s: that was from uh interestingly enough uh
11146.60s: gee that must have been
11150.28s: 10 15 years ago that uh uh Bob Remy who
11155.72s: was the president of the Academy of Arts
11157.88s: and Science uh he and Ma newfeld are the
11161.76s: guys that do all the Tom Clancy movies
11164.28s: Patriot Games and October they wanted to
11167.12s: do the Iran Contra case uh and uh I was
11170.60s: in Bob ry's office and his uh staff guy
11175.60s: uh Nikki gillo uh over to me and pulled
11178.48s: me aside and said Danny he said there's
11179.92s: a there's a fellow that uh wants to talk
11182.68s: to you needs to talk to you he said I
11184.24s: think he's very important uh would you
11186.68s: be willing to go talk with him uh
11189.04s: without even knowing who he is uh and I
11191.52s: said look if you say so Nikki I'll I'll
11193.68s: do it uh and I had some space between
11196.64s: that meeting with Bob Remy uh and going
11199.88s: to see um uh uh Marlin Brando who wanted
11204.88s: to play Theodore shackley wow in the
11206.92s: movie that so I had a space in the
11208.88s: afternoon I I I'll I'll go this so Nikki
11211.72s: brings me out and we get in his big red
11213.96s: El Dorado Cadillac convertible he had
11216.64s: this like 1962 elor convertible so we
11220.16s: drive off and we go over to the uh to
11223.00s: war Brothers uh Studios uh going to the
11227.20s: lot and we go into this guy's office and
11229.08s: it turns out to be
11231.64s: um uh Bill Bill toddman Jr it's Mark
11236.60s: Goodson and Bill Tod man used to be the
11238.96s: big famous team that would they produced
11241.60s: I Love Lucy $64,000 Question You Know
11245.60s: What's My Line they produced all these
11248.12s: and so Bill toddman Jr was the son of
11251.48s: Bill toddman and he was a uh a junior
11255.24s: exec of some kind at Warner Brothers uh
11258.40s: and uh he wanted to talk to me because
11261.04s: it turns out he had he had actually seen
11263.80s: the UFO wow he said that when he was in
11266.32s: college he had uh he was hiking actually
11268.88s: outside of Boulder Colorado up in the
11270.96s: the flat irons uh and some big Meadow up
11273.76s: in there and he' walk up to this Meadow
11275.48s: and here's a UFO he said sitting right
11277.96s: in the middle of the meadow this big
11280.20s: field and he went all the way over to it
11283.64s: and put his hand on it and it was alive
11287.76s: he said this thing I could tell it was
11290.88s: the The Craft itself was
11293.28s: alive and that was the first time that
11295.56s: I'd uh had that info so I started
11298.48s: checking into that and started finding
11300.64s: out about stuff that was going on and I
11304.12s: found out that our there's uh some of
11307.56s: our Labs uh that are working on AI stuff
11311.44s: we actually and this is back that must
11314.80s: be I said 10 10 12 years ago uh actually
11319.92s: are using human stem
11323.52s: cells to generate uh synapses in
11328.92s: computers
11331.84s: whoa yeah fast forward that a million
11334.60s: years and what does that look like
11335.80s: that's right that's right and so I was
11337.96s: on to this like about 10 15 years ago so
11340.96s: that I've been tracking that stuff about
11342.80s: the the crafts actually being sentient
11345.52s: in some way uh and I knew that they they
11348.48s: pulled the helmet out of the the Roswell
11351.08s: crafts cuz the they were
11353.00s: communicating with with the craft
11355.08s: telepathically but uh but I hadn't known
11357.40s: part of that that there was sentient
11359.48s: kind of Consciousness in the craft that
11361.60s: responded to it yeah Philip Corso had
11363.56s: mentioned that the headpiece that's
11365.04s: right um there's also someone who Dr
11368.88s: Greer brought on for the disclosure
11370.84s: project in the more recent one that he
11372.76s: did a few years ago there was a
11374.60s: gentleman there that said he had met he
11377.32s: was working at some test range um that
11380.56s: rathon was a part of and whatnot but at
11382.80s: night he was with I think his his lady
11385.52s: and in the middle of the road there was
11387.00s: this like dark triangular sort of like
11389.96s: vanta Black Craft that was just kind of
11392.72s: like right there and as he got out he
11394.20s: went to touch it and it was like purring
11395.76s: like a kitten and it kind of like
11397.00s: recoiled and this whole strange story
11400.92s: you know incred like it's it's just when
11403.92s: you think you got a grasp on what the
11405.80s: heck's going on you're like oh yeah we
11409.84s: the we're just touching the edges of
11412.00s: this thing right now yeah you know this
11413.76s: this uh reminds me of a story that I us
11416.12s: should tell you that that
11418.04s: uh two two very dear friends of mine uh
11422.00s: that uh mighty ma Robert McIntosh was
11424.12s: one of my friends from college in law
11425.68s: school uh and uh who went on to become
11428.16s: the chief Assistant Attorney General of
11429.56s: the state of Washington actually but and
11432.24s: Joe Zen who was a dear friend of mine
11434.32s: who was a computer programmer specialist
11437.32s: for IBM and they were friends of mine
11439.52s: were sitting in our living room in New
11442.04s: York when I was working for the cill
11443.36s: firm it was like a Sunday afternoon and
11445.88s: we were sitting there passing a joint
11447.56s: around you know and and kind of laughing
11451.08s: and in Joe's in started talking about
11453.36s: says you don't understand what's going
11454.72s: on in this computer field he said
11457.24s: there's stuff there's stuff that's going
11459.00s: on that in another 50 years he said they
11462.96s: will be doing things that you can't even
11466.00s: conceive of right now and mighty ma said
11469.76s: like
11471.76s: what that's where we are right now you
11474.48s: know with regard to all this stuff you
11476.12s: know that that we we aren even able to
11478.04s: kind of really capture the concepts all
11480.72s: we're doing is projecting Out Concepts
11483.64s: we've already figured out you know and
11486.20s: we're project trying to project them out
11487.88s: to the next kind of integer logical step
11490.72s: that's right but but these people are
11492.84s: wowing us every every time you think
11495.04s: you're getting near this thing so you
11497.20s: have to be careful about you know over
11500.12s: concretizing any particular piece of
11503.00s: information you got but the thing with
11504.36s: psionics it's the first time I heard it
11507.00s: uh and I was sworn to secrecy when I was
11509.40s: told about the Pion it's called psionic
11512.48s: assists that there's a
11514.68s: technology that they've got that develop
11517.56s: that is amping up the capacities of
11523.00s: individuals to do uh telepathic
11526.72s: communication wow an actual technology
11529.36s: yeah and it's they call it psionic
11530.88s: assist and it's very dangerous and it's
11533.96s: frying out the brains of people that
11537.76s: they're testing and they've but they
11540.88s: still keep on doing it uh and it's very
11543.60s: dangerous very dangerous but it's
11546.20s: working it's they it's working enough to
11550.32s: keep them doing it uh despite what the
11552.76s: consequences are but there
11554.96s: Pilots American Pilots that have been
11557.80s: subjected to this thing uh in are just
11561.80s: killed them actually and they keep doing
11564.56s: it they've got this opinion that if
11565.96s: you're in the military you're you're
11567.72s: ours and we can do whatever we want you
11569.56s: know but they spend Millions training
11571.48s: these guys and they're they're risking
11574.48s: everything but are there any current
11576.24s: investigations going on with this
11578.52s: there's one that we're in the process of
11580.04s: putting together I'm in communication
11581.76s: with guys in the justice department now
11584.04s: if we can get things settled down yeah
11585.88s: inside the justice department enough you
11588.32s: know that uh that uh uh uh cash forel is
11592.40s: in FBI now they've got uh uh Pam uh is
11596.88s: uh uh on over at Justice now and they
11601.32s: they've ordered everybody in the
11604.08s: Criminal Division which this would be uh
11606.96s: you know to resign to sign these
11609.32s: resignation letters so I'm talking to
11611.72s: the guys who have refused to sign or who
11614.52s: have been given permission not to have
11616.00s: to sign uh because they're kind of
11617.88s: restructuring the internals of Justice
11620.12s: right now uh to investigate this
11624.80s: thing okay that's uh uh that's really
11628.00s: interesting and concerning as well it's
11629.60s: very alarming you know this is
11633.00s: um I suspect this is all part of a
11636.48s: little bit of what uh David grush and
11639.12s: Jake Barber have been alluding to that
11641.28s: there
11642.44s: are there have been some projects that
11646.16s: have sort of disregarded human life that
11649.88s: have to do with these
11651.56s: retrievals and that's yeah that is right
11655.16s: that's the that's the dark part of all
11656.76s: this yeah is it's it's not so much the
11659.56s: using of tech which obviously you know
11661.80s: is illegal because they want to like
11663.48s: whatever proprietary blah blah blah but
11665.88s: then it's like oh they're hurting people
11668.84s: yeah yeah yeah and they can't do this
11671.44s: you know I mean you know they they think
11673.08s: we're naive and you know that like you
11675.04s: know as civilians you don't know what
11676.20s: you're talking about you know we have to
11678.08s: we have to put people at risk in order
11679.84s: to you know test pilots but that's
11681.64s: voluntary and I assume that they were
11684.24s: getting these Pilots to voluntarily
11686.32s: agree to try this technology that they
11688.96s: have uh but they they shouldn't have
11692.28s: done they shouldn't have gone to the
11693.72s: lengths which they took G and you know
11695.68s: following the paper trail this
11697.08s: technology well there's probably a
11699.16s: company that came up with
11700.84s: that yes well they they've worked off
11704.72s: they've worked off I think they were
11706.32s: working off the helmet technology trying
11708.48s: to figure out what that was from from
11711.12s: Roswell yeah yeah I think it started
11713.44s: there and but it's it's a it's a psionic
11716.44s: assist it's not just it's it's not just
11718.96s: a conduiting of the actual you knowy
11722.12s: brain wav it's it's it's amplifying it's
11724.60s: amplifying dramatically and it's uh it's
11727.40s: fatal
11729.68s: wow and obviously yeah people are
11731.88s: signing up for it don't know what
11732.80s: they're getting into I'm sure
11736.08s: right that's yeah that's concerning
11739.56s: MH um well this question kind of is a a
11742.80s: little bit of a followup to that so this
11744.28s: will be the last one here
11753.60s: by slang he says are you aware of any
11756.16s: whistleblowers or evidence not known by
11758.24s: the public about to come out in the next
11760.44s: month in the next
11764.72s: month yes yeah could be yes or no yeah
11768.04s: yeah yeah
11771.64s: um without giving away too much because
11775.44s: obviously if that is the case we want to
11777.68s: be protective of yeah you know whoever I
11780.24s: I don't want to I don't want to touch on
11782.16s: that any further my relationships of
11784.40s: course people there um on a scale of one
11788.00s: to disclosure with a big
11790.20s: D no it's not that yet they're not there
11792.72s: yet because they they they have to they
11796.00s: have to bring on all the other
11798.60s: structures I see you know they they
11800.36s: they've got to have justice department
11802.36s: involved in it to decide you know
11804.80s: whether anybody's going to be given
11806.20s: immunity
11807.44s: to to disclose the information you know
11810.60s: uh who are the people that are going to
11812.52s: be suspect to might try to retaliate
11814.84s: against them so that they can reach out
11816.96s: to them to warn them not to do this uh
11820.44s: you know they they need to uh they need
11823.56s: to figure out who else might get
11826.72s: potentially exposed by revealing this
11830.20s: information uh you know there's there's
11833.56s: complexifications but my my role in this
11836.44s: is to make sure that the
11837.84s: complexifications don't become
11839.84s: justifications in rationale National
11842.20s: secur continuing the same that
11844.24s: we've been dealing with for 80 years
11845.96s: because they've all got they've all got
11847.44s: some excuse for why they they don't do
11849.24s: this of course H do you think do you do
11851.64s: you think that there will ever be some
11853.24s: type of Channel kind of like a witness
11854.72s: protection program equivalent for some
11857.16s: of these whistleblowers because it seems
11858.76s: like you know just offering them a
11861.20s: pension for a lot of these
11862.56s: whistleblowers isn't enough because
11864.08s: their lives might be at stake yeah you
11866.20s: the problem is you can't hide from the
11868.52s: they've got the remote viewing capacity
11870.48s: when when they can when they can read
11871.80s: files you know at a distance like this
11874.80s: you know you aren't going to hide
11875.88s: there's no hiding out from these from
11877.92s: this and it's a and and it's it's sad
11880.68s: because uh I
11882.36s: mean the
11884.60s: the effective and legitimate utilization
11887.80s: of capacities like that you know is hard
11890.12s: to really figure out why it's a good
11892.20s: thing to go around reading people's
11893.40s: minds or anything else you know so
11895.40s: almost all of this has been
11897.32s: boosted by military objectives and
11899.52s: spying and Espionage things you know so
11902.60s: that in it's surveillance but but you
11904.76s: say things like you know wouldn't you
11906.32s: want to know if there's a a person loose
11909.16s: who's raping kidnapping and raping
11911.60s: four-year-old children you know don't
11913.88s: you think we ought to be able to get at
11916.24s: this person and stop them you know they
11918.12s: always they always give you these these
11920.20s: horrible extreme examples to get you to
11923.44s: agree in principle that somebody ought
11925.16s: to be able to do that then you say yeah
11927.08s: but who's going to be in charge of that
11928.60s: and who do they decide to Target and
11930.56s: then what happens when it starts
11932.16s: discovering that they're actually spying
11934.00s: on elected representatives to figure out
11935.96s: what their position is on a bill which
11937.80s: they will do they will do they will use
11941.00s: all of these things that that's from the
11942.48s: Constitutional point of view that uh
11944.56s: that Larry tribe always taught us saying
11947.36s: look at you've got to understand that
11949.40s: any power that you agree to uh is given
11954.44s: to the government they they will try to
11957.52s: abuse it that's what we know about
11959.92s: that's what the purpose of the
11960.92s: Constitution is yeah you have to assume
11963.72s: that there's somebody eventually is
11965.52s: going to try to abuse it and so you have
11967.60s: to set up kind of prophylactic measures
11970.72s: to keep that from happening if you're
11972.32s: going to Grant any kind of power to to a
11975.80s: governing structure uh and that's our
11978.64s: job as constitutional litigators is to
11981.32s: figure out what those restrictions are
11983.28s: that are reasonable that you know take
11985.48s: into account what the leg legitimate
11987.04s: interests of the collective Community
11988.40s: are in law enforcement and protection uh
11991.72s: without overdoing it knowing that the
11994.44s: history has always been to overdo it
11997.44s: yeah always has been the history follow
11999.64s: that yeah and so that we we have to be
12001.48s: willing to accept some of the
12003.52s: consequences of having uh a governing
12006.96s: structure that isn't as effective as
12010.24s: it's conceivably possible to be you know
12013.12s: I mean this idea of having the the you
12015.56s: know television camera on all the street
12017.96s: lights now the stop lights in in
12020.72s: photographing your license plate and you
12022.64s: in the car and then keeping all the
12024.88s: information and sending to the fusion
12026.60s: centers that they have and then they say
12028.88s: oh that's not a violation of any of your
12030.64s: Fourth Amendment rights because you're
12031.72s: out in public you know uh and then they
12034.12s: say okay what about your phone call oh
12035.76s: they're monitoring your phone calls too
12037.56s: and they actually take the position oh
12039.12s: yeah monitoring your phone calls and
12040.76s: recording all your phone calls doesn't
12042.28s: violate your right to privacy and unless
12044.92s: they want to listen to them mhm you know
12047.24s: they're just storing them and in that
12048.64s: case they they'd have to file a warrant
12051.40s: but the problem is is then they've got
12053.00s: the fisa court uh the foreign
12055.00s: intelligence surveillance Court where
12056.92s: they say you don't need to have probable
12059.20s: cause to believe that any crimes been
12060.72s: committed yeah all you have to do is
12062.44s: have an articulable articulable
12065.52s: suspicion sure that
12067.56s: information uh related to a national
12070.92s: security interest of the United States
12073.48s: uh may be discussed yeah oh wow disgus
12076.64s: how's that for a standard you know and
12078.64s: then bang they're into your telephone
12080.52s: conversations you know and they they had
12082.92s: over two dozen instances where that
12086.28s: power was invoked just on behalf of
12088.68s: normal law enforcement not how easy it
12091.56s: was not not any intelligence uh activity
12094.48s: but but law enforcement oh uh and then
12097.28s: then you run into people say well don't
12098.76s: you think you should try to get people
12100.24s: that are doing Kitty porn you know don't
12102.36s: you think they should have some way of I
12104.12s: mean stopping you know kids from being
12106.00s: subjected to Kitty porn you know and and
12110.00s: and then you if you say no I think you
12112.76s: know that that shouldn't justify you
12114.72s: know listening to everybody's telephone
12116.20s: calls then somehow you're supporting kyn
12118.68s: you're the bad guy you know you know and
12120.20s: you're saying look at that's just bad
12121.52s: thinking you know so I don't I don't
12123.60s: have to worry about you I mean if you're
12125.96s: going to have that kind of thinking I'm
12128.64s: not going to be able to persuade you
12129.76s: yeah there's an argument for against
12131.60s: anything really we just have to look at
12133.72s: logic let that sort of dictate what what
12137.08s: we're allowed to be doing or using this
12139.20s: stuff for and and and and there's there
12142.48s: is a means at our disposal as human
12145.68s: beings by means of which we can actually
12150.00s: discern what type of human conduct
12152.96s: either individual or Collective you know
12156.04s: is either harmonious with or
12157.68s: disharmonious to the Natural order of
12161.28s: the universe you know that's natural law
12164.24s: that that there is such a thing and we
12167.04s: can discern it and that's what this
12168.76s: whole faculty of discernment is about
12171.56s: the whole conscience is about it has to
12174.24s: do with Consciousness you know and the
12176.56s: higher and higher your Consciousness is
12178.92s: the larger and larger your perspective
12180.96s: is on things the more appropriate the
12183.68s: decisions are that you're going to be
12185.36s: making of course you know and and that's
12187.32s: why that's why this is so hopeful if if
12189.84s: we're at a point where or a juncture
12191.76s: where we're going to be actually
12193.56s: participating and elevating the
12195.84s: consciousness
12197.04s: uh generally of our whole Human family
12199.72s: we hoping that that's going to bring
12201.72s: about an improvement in our conduct
12204.32s: toward each other it will inevitably you
12206.08s: know and and that's but but the whole
12208.96s: issue of Free Will of trying to force
12211.48s: that on people or make them raise their
12214.64s: Consciousness in some way or Force an
12217.32s: increase in Consciousness on them by
12219.12s: Shocking them by exposing them to some
12221.44s: sort of analogical shock you know uh is
12225.36s: a is a those are moral and ethical
12228.32s: questions that we have to answer that's
12230.92s: that's why I ended up at Jesuit
12232.48s: headquarters instead of an fle Bailey's
12234.68s: office where he was asking me to
12237.16s: represent Mikey andulo of the Angulo
12240.00s: Brothers crime family right and I was
12241.88s: looking at him like what are you kidding
12243.04s: me you know I mean what do you think I'm
12244.72s: a wise guy yeah as as I said to Mikey
12247.92s: Angulo you know Mr Angulo I wouldn't
12250.48s: piss on you if you were on fire I said
12253.04s: so you understand what my relationship
12254.72s: with you is I said cuz I know what you
12256.96s: are and I you kill people that you know
12259.32s: you think betray you mhm I don't want
12261.56s: you to get the sight of suspicion that
12263.04s: I'm ever working for you or doing
12264.64s: anything to help you because so I'm
12266.32s: never going to betray youh you know so
12269.64s: that's what I said to him you
12272.08s: know yeah I
12274.56s: mean you know we've got a we've got a
12276.80s: long way to go but we've also come uh a
12279.80s: long way oh yes um you know I I and I
12282.64s: think it's I think it's really Noble I
12284.60s: think it's great what we're doing and I
12286.40s: encourage you know everyone out there to
12288.56s: go check out new paradigm institute.org
12291.52s: and participate in any way you can and
12294.04s: even if you don't want to do that you
12295.88s: know
12296.84s: just make sure to have an open mind when
12299.56s: having these conversations I think it
12301.24s: goes a lot further than you would expect
12303.96s: in the grand scheme of things you know
12305.52s: if we can go back to a bit of the Mind
12307.84s: State we had in the 60s and 70s where
12310.48s: people were a little bit more open to
12313.68s: Love Leading the conversation
12316.96s: um I think you know inevitably it takes
12319.96s: away the desire for militarization and
12323.44s: this sort of uh the sort of control that
12326.56s: is being exhibited on us you know and it
12329.32s: makes it a little bit more of an
12330.92s: expansive reality to live in and one
12332.68s: filled with a little bit more positive
12334.20s: nature and I think that's again a very
12336.56s: Noble thing well PE people are going to
12338.88s: discover it if they if they become
12340.52s: citizens for disclosure they're going to
12342.52s: become part of a community yes you know
12345.36s: uh and ideally in their local
12347.24s: jurisdiction and they'll get to meet the
12348.84s: other people you know go to their homes
12350.92s: meet their kids you know start to have a
12353.08s: sense of Community in Sharing this kind
12355.68s: of optimistic positive View and and one
12358.76s: of the things that they can be assured
12360.64s: and that is that the new paradigm
12362.24s: Institute is not going to be naive about
12364.84s: this you know that we're cognizant of
12367.36s: some of these concerns uh all the
12370.00s: concerns that people have about this
12372.08s: including the National Security interest
12374.00s: and other things you know that I'm not
12376.40s: great fan of the National Security State
12379.44s: uh infrastructure I'm not a great fan of
12381.72s: the nation state image which is part of
12384.28s: the Treaty of West phalia like of
12386.76s: 1625 you know which was an agreement
12389.24s: made by the royal families to divide J
12391.96s: the physical areas up for the royal
12393.56s: families to control so I'm not I'm not
12396.44s: absolutely committed to the the
12398.84s: maintenance of the institution of the
12400.40s: nation state but the people who work and
12402.76s: are raised in the National Security
12404.68s: State that becomes their abs abolute
12406.80s: totem yeah you know that that's what
12408.72s: they have to protect you know and
12410.56s: they're assigned to do it and trained to
12412.36s: do it so I know that it gives them the
12414.40s: Willies whenever I say something like
12416.92s: you know that we may have to have some
12418.68s: sort of larger you know juridical
12422.04s: Association on our planet sounds a
12424.24s: little too libertarian for that yeah it
12425.84s: just just sounds scary sounds like the
12427.20s: One World Government you know that's
12428.84s: going to be you know I mean how are we
12430.96s: doing with our own nation state
12432.76s: government right now yeah I you know I
12434.64s: often think of that too and people are
12435.92s: like uh One World Government beware I'm
12438.00s: like of what it sounds amazing like I
12440.32s: don't maybe that's the scop is that we
12442.64s: were bred to think it's a bad thing I'm
12444.40s: like doesn't one world government mean
12446.32s: we have no one left to fight yeah isn't
12448.96s: that you know and they're like well
12450.36s: they'll put a chip in you is as long as
12452.04s: you maintain your right of free will of
12454.28s: course you know that I can you know I
12455.64s: can participate and and if you want to
12457.96s: opt out you know I mean I I think this
12460.40s: is outrageous that they say now you know
12463.00s: that you got to go in if you're going to
12464.48s: be allowed to drive a car
12466.72s: yeah you know you got soci credit and
12468.92s: all You' got to have you got to have a a
12471.00s: driver's license that's got this chip in
12473.12s: it so they can monitor you wherever you
12475.44s: are uh and and and then they're going to
12478.20s: going to have it all be a a what they
12480.88s: call a national identifier yeah you know
12483.32s: and they're going to and then eventually
12484.72s: they're going to want you to use it for
12486.12s: all your credit cards and your medical
12488.00s: stuff you you got to you got to
12490.00s: recognize it ahead of time M for the
12492.00s: record I'm not I'm not in favor of being
12493.96s: chipped
12494.88s: up I was kind of going along with it but
12499.04s: not a good idea no I definitely no chips
12501.12s: here no um you know we've seen what
12503.68s: happens with social credit and China and
12505.52s: everything else and it's just uh it's
12507.08s: just a terrible thing for Humanity to be
12509.20s: it's another means of control and and
12511.00s: that's something we just have to no
12513.28s: we're basic we're basic free free will
12516.04s: Champions here you know uh in that we
12518.28s: want to maximize the amount of free will
12520.56s: the individuals have and we want to we
12522.72s: want to maximize the degree of
12524.56s: cooperation that people have
12526.96s: we want to minimalize the the
12528.88s: application of brute force or violence
12532.64s: allism yeah and so that it's it's not
12535.16s: surprising and that's why if you if you
12537.48s: look to Christianity yeah and uh and uh
12541.40s: Hinduism Buddhism uh and uh and Judaism
12545.92s: you know that all of these basic uh
12548.40s: ethics are there sure you know so that
12551.36s: these are these are things that is is
12553.40s: like a parallel value system that we've
12556.60s: been exposed to and all we're doing is
12558.48s: saying that we we prefer this one to
12561.48s: have the balance of of kindness and
12563.80s: loving and and compassion and charity uh
12566.80s: and concern for your fellow human being
12569.32s: and other sentient beings uh and you
12571.92s: know that the worst that could happen is
12573.48s: they say oh you're too naive sure you
12575.52s: know and that you know we're not going
12576.64s: to we're not going to give you a
12577.88s: security clearance yeah and at the same
12579.44s: time you can pray for whoever you want
12581.52s: yeah you know we can still work towards
12583.44s: this beneficial event yeah uh and in the
12587.28s: meantime you know you can still have all
12590.68s: have your cake and eat it
