0.24s: What is one sort of fringe encounter
3.12s: that still kind of troubles you to this
5.36s: day? We had a case in 1993, well
9.60s: actually a wave of sightings
11.76s: collectively known as the Cosford
14.24s: incident. One guy was so stunned by this
19.60s: huge triangular shaped craft that he
22.48s: leapt into his car and started trying to
26.16s: chase it with his family in the back
28.88s: screaming at him to stop. In this same
32.16s: encounter, there was a a farmer who saw
36.16s: this this craft very low and he thought
38.80s: it's so low he thought it maybe it
41.20s: landed and he went up to the field and
44.88s: all the cows in the field were standing
48.72s: in a circle like facing each
52.76s: other straight out of the axe files. Wa!
56.24s: a whole bunch of normallooking people
59.68s: all walked into an art shop in central
63.28s: London were there for like a long time
66.56s: and and she she just felt there was
68.88s: something weird about these people and
71.44s: then after a long time they made a big
74.16s: show of coming up and buying a single
76.60s: pencil like it was like a big thing and
80.80s: then they handed over a very high
82.80s: denomination bank note and when the
85.68s: woman went to give them their change.
88.64s: They they looked confused like they
91.28s: didn't understand the concept of getting
93.52s: their change bag and she was so struck
97.12s: by this that she phoned somebody
99.68s: afterwards and said, "There are aliens
102.00s: in my shop." So, you said you got to
104.56s: know this woman quite well. Um, was that
107.12s: afterwards? Did she have any other
109.12s: encounters? One that I would say was
112.40s: more of a time slip.
114.56s: missing time,
116.76s: seeing somebody that looked like herself
119.92s: from the future.
125.04s: I was um down along the east coast,
128.72s: United States, Virginia Beach kind of
130.56s: area. Yeah. Doing a a night jog kind of
133.44s: run along the beach. Looked up in the
135.12s: sky and I saw a purplish it looked like
138.08s: a basically a sting I don't know. It
140.32s: looked like a stingray but without the
142.32s: tail. And uh and it was uh translucent
147.92s: and a purplish color and it it flew over
151.84s: it went it felt like it was 100 yards
154.56s: above my head, maybe even less. We
156.80s: interrupt this broadcast for a message
158.40s: from Area 52. Just a quick pause. Our
161.04s: brand new out of body long sleeves are
164.16s: now live. Available in three colors:
166.48s: midnight black, analog sand, or signal
169.20s: blue. They're heavyweight with a clean
171.20s: design and built for the curious. If you
172.96s: know, you know. Check it out at
175.72s: area52.shop. Limited stock only and we
178.16s: will not be restocking these, so get
180.00s: them while you
181.00s: can. Welcome, Nicholas Pope. Thank you.
184.64s: Yeah, absolutely. For those not familiar
186.64s: uh with Nick Pope, you know, he might be
188.08s: a familiar face to a lot of you on the
190.48s: History Channels Ancient Aliens, but
192.48s: prior to that spent 21 years working for
195.04s: the Ministry of Defense and also
198.32s: subsequently worked for what is known as
200.40s: the UFO desk uh over at the Ministry as
203.76s: well. Um very very interesting stuff.
206.80s: Also an author uh wrote multiple books
209.84s: uh fiction and non-fiction which is uh
212.72s: interesting. We'll get into that as
214.00s: well. Um but more famously I think you
217.92s: know did a lot of work on the
219.36s: Rendlessham case as well. So a lot to
222.80s: talk about today. Uh Nick Pope I first
224.88s: of all I want to thank you for joining
226.32s: me uh in the skiff. Thank you. It's good
228.80s: to be here un unlike David Grash. Here
231.60s: we are in the skiff.
234.64s: That's hilarious. One day maybe. Um, so
238.80s: as we get started, I'd like to just
240.88s: maybe cover some, you know, introductory
243.56s: grounds and just for the audience that
245.84s: might not be familiar with you or your
247.52s: work, uh, can you tell me a little bit
249.12s: about, uh, and we'll keep this brief,
251.04s: but a little bit about how you got
252.56s: started coming in from the Ministry of
254.72s: Defense into, uh,
257.16s: Eupfology? Sure thing. Well, the
259.76s: Ministry of Defense essentially is like
262.08s: a Department of State in the UK. I was
265.60s: there as a civilian employee like you
267.68s: say for 21 years they move you around a
269.84s: lot so I did lots of different things
272.40s: but yeah from 1991 through to 1994 I was
277.12s: posted to the so-called UFO desk and the
280.32s: mission basically which I chose to
282.72s: accept was was to research and
285.36s: investigate the phenomenon and assess
287.44s: the potential defense national security
290.72s: and safety of flight implications. Yeah,
293.60s: I mean that is quite a hefty task now
297.12s: doing this back then, you know, like
298.80s: today this might not seem so unheard of
301.44s: because of, you know, the recent task
303.28s: force that's been appointed, but also
304.80s: the other programs like OAP and ATIP and
306.72s: all this stuff, but back in the '9s,
308.88s: like I mean, this was XFiles time. Yes,
312.24s: it was. And and that actually led to a
314.80s: few insider jokes, I guess. I mean,
317.68s: literally, I would be walking down the
319.60s: corridor in the Ministry of Defense and
322.08s: people would whistle the theme tune to
323.76s: the X-Files as I went past and and say,
326.88s: "Look, there he goes. It's it's Nick
329.04s: Spooky
331.00s: Pope." Wow. Um, how many people were
334.72s: working in your department during that
336.56s: time at the UFO desk? Essentially it was
339.60s: just me and admin support but obviously
342.96s: we had a network of people that whilst
346.72s: not posted to that particular operation
350.80s: could be called upon. So for example you
352.88s: know we we had instant access to radar
356.36s: specialists and radar was obviously a
358.64s: big part of of any investigation. We had
361.28s: instant access to intelligence community
364.44s: imagery analysis resources and
367.48s: capabilities. Um the the Met Office, the
371.60s: Royal Greenwich Observatory, it's all
373.76s: about trying to bring in experts,
375.60s: whether they're astronomers,
377.80s: meteorologists, radar experts, whatever
380.48s: they are, you know, whatever you need.
382.96s: It's like a toolkit that that you have.
386.20s: Right. Very interesting. Do you um being
389.04s: like a one-man team for that is that
391.20s: difficult? Would it would it would it
392.72s: not have been a lot easier to to have
394.88s: several people on these cases? It would
397.28s: have been and and had we had more
399.52s: resources. Absolutely. That's well, you
402.40s: know, there is no manager or very few
405.60s: managers who don't want more resources,
408.24s: more more people on the team. I would
410.16s: have loved to have had somebody
411.52s: full-time, you know, like um a radar
415.12s: person um a psychologist that would have
418.00s: been useful. Um but but you know, this
422.32s: was the time when this subject even
424.56s: within government was more fringe than
427.52s: it is now. I mean now particularly in
429.84s: the US of course we we have as you
432.16s: mentioned the the recently established
434.64s: uh task force on the declassification of
436.64s: federal secrets. We've had UFO related
440.32s: provisions in every National Defense
442.80s: Authorization Act um for for several
445.60s: years now. We've had classified
447.52s: briefings in Congress, public hearings,
451.20s: NASA doing a report. So, if I was doing
454.24s: that job now, I'm sure I would have had
456.40s: more resources. But at the time, yeah,
458.16s: it it was pretty much me and admin
460.48s: support. And it's Yeah, there's a lot on
464.08s: your shoulders.
465.84s: this. Oh, I forgot to turn off turn on
468.00s: my oscilloscopes. Very important for
469.76s: this uh for this interview that these
471.40s: oscilloscopes are turned on.
474.92s: Um there I mean you've probably looked
477.92s: at a lot of cases from 1991 to '94 and
481.20s: in the '9s obviously I mean there was a
483.52s: a a rampant surge in especially mass
487.00s: sightings you know going from obviously
490.24s: uh you know 97 which we just celebrated
492.40s: the anniversary of the Phoenix lights
494.88s: but also you had uh you know Ruiz
496.96s: Zimbabwe you had Virginia these these
499.04s: pretty big cases. Um, did you ever
502.48s: encounter or investigate any of the mass
505.04s: sightings that happened during that time
506.48s: or prior? Not outside of the UK. This
510.08s: was one of the very interesting things
512.56s: in a way. Our terms of reference were
515.36s: really tight and because of the I guess
518.52s: political
520.04s: sensitivities about this and and I mean
522.64s: that in terms of some people would say
525.20s: you know this is all nonsense. Why are
527.04s: you wasting taxpayers money on it? So we
529.92s: we had to be very careful with this. Our
533.04s: terms of reference were tightly drawn to
537.76s: defending the UK. So it was like if
540.00s: there's something in our airspace, we
541.92s: need to know what it is. That's
543.52s: legitimate business. Going and looking
546.16s: at at something that's happened in in
549.28s: Africa or or even in the United States
552.08s: or elsewhere in Europe, that would have
554.24s: been like, well, why are we doing that?
555.92s: So Sure. I see. I was aware of things
558.96s: like that going on, but it was not for
563.20s: me to actually Right. In in an official
565.68s: capacity, you weren't you were kind of
567.84s: like restricting yourself to not, you
569.60s: know, uh delve into other people's
571.76s: business. Yes. Um Okay. Well, I mean
575.04s: obviously there's a lot of cases in the
576.64s: UK as well that have happened um pri a
579.76s: little bit prior to that and you know um
582.72s: subsequently afterwards even even
584.40s: recently uh the the Lake and Heath you
586.88s: know air force base is obviously famous
590.08s: uh for for multiple sightings going back
592.16s: all the way I think to the 50s. Yes. Um
595.36s: but I mean looking at all that these are
598.08s: all sort of official radar and military
601.68s: personnel related. Did you investigate
604.96s: any sort of civilian uh in um witnesses
609.20s: or or witnesses to uh civilian events
611.52s: that have happened? Yes, we did. And and
614.32s: in fact, we were a public-f facing
618.16s: program rather like the old US Air Force
622.00s: Project Blue Book. Um we did do
625.28s: classified work, but most of what we did
628.08s: on a day-to-day basis was unclassified.
630.80s: I think it's like Avi Lobe says, you
632.72s: can't classify the skies, right? Um, and
636.16s: I would say although we concentrated on
640.08s: military cases because they were often
642.64s: ones where you had access to the
644.40s: witnesses, you knew that those people
646.24s: were reliable. when when pilots tell you
649.76s: about encounters and when it's
651.60s: particularly if it's corroborated by
653.20s: radar evidence there's something in in
655.84s: terms of
657.40s: evidence data you can get into that
661.04s: being said 80 85 90% of the cases that I
667.04s: looked at which are two or 30 hundred
669.04s: each year probably came from the public
671.84s: so as much as I'm interested in the
674.64s: military's perspective of UFOs
677.20s: I find myself, as you can see, all these
679.04s: books behind me here are all related to
682.00s: civilian encounters. What is one sort of
685.36s: fringe encounter that still kind of
687.92s: troubles you to this day that you might
689.84s: have that you might have like that might
691.44s: have stuck with you after investigating
693.36s: it? We had a case in 1993, well actually
698.08s: a wave of sightings collectively known
700.96s: as the Cosford incident.
707.84s: We get stories every week, encounters,
710.60s: objects,
712.44s: beings, but most of it never makes it
714.64s: past a sketch or a shaky interview until
717.60s: now. You see, Art List just launched an
720.40s: AI video and image generator. But this
723.60s: isn't your typical AI toy. It's built
726.48s: for creators, for people who tell
728.00s: stories through visuals like us. Let me
730.80s: show you something. You see, a real
732.80s: witness described seeing a circular
734.56s: discshaped craft off the right wing tip
736.56s: of his flight to Japan in
739.08s: 1965. And until now, this was the best
743.04s: photo we had. So, we typed in that
745.20s: prompt and within seconds, well, the
747.76s: image came to life. Lit by the setting
750.96s: sun hovering silently and ominously
753.36s: beside the plane. There it was. But
755.76s: here's where it gets wild. You see, with
757.68s: Art List's tools, we turned it into a
759.36s: full video scene.
761.44s: Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing
763.68s: some turbulence. Smoking is not
765.68s: permitted on board at any time. And this
767.12s: includes the use of the
770.08s: with sound design, footage, music, and
772.40s: even color
773.80s: grading. We built the moment from a
776.64s: single sentence, and now we're
779.12s: reconstructing history frame by frame.
781.28s: So go to Artless today or click the link
783.12s: in my description to try it out for
784.64s: yourself. Artless AI, powered by vision,
788.32s: used by believers. And although there
792.16s: were police and military sightings in
795.56s: that in a way the most interesting cases
798.88s: did come from the public literally. For
800.84s: example, one guy was so stunned by this
806.08s: huge triangular shaped craft that he was
808.96s: witnessing that he leapt into his car
812.00s: and started trying to chase it. driving
814.96s: along the road, keeping it in view with
817.68s: his family in the back screaming at him
820.48s: to stop because they saw it too and and
824.00s: were scared whereas he was excited. And
828.32s: in this same encounter, there was a a
831.00s: farmer who saw this this craft very low
835.28s: and he thought it's so low he thought it
837.28s: maybe it landed in one of his fields.
840.96s: and he went up to the field and I think
845.12s: I'm I'm trying all the cows in the field
849.28s: were standing in a circle like facing
852.88s: each other completely silent and there
855.52s: was no UFO there but they were all just
857.68s: doing that
858.92s: like straight out of the X files and and
863.20s: so you have things like that and you're
866.08s: thinking well I don't know. Yeah, that
868.80s: is terrifying. I mean, I don't I don't
870.48s: think there are very many uh unsettling
872.80s: things cows could do uh other than
875.60s: standing in a circle like some type of
877.72s: weird some type of weird ritual. You
880.40s: know, that that reminds me actually of
882.00s: like the Belgian UFO wave a little bit.
884.68s: Well, very interesting you should say
887.44s: that because there was talking of the X
890.40s: Files and spooky coincidences.
893.20s: This this wave of sightings, the Cosford
895.68s: incident took place late on the night of
900.08s: March 30th and in the early hours of
902.72s: March 31st,
904.68s: 1993. And of course, as I was
907.28s: investigating this, something was was
909.52s: kind of gnoring at the back of my mind,
911.52s: and I couldn't quite put my finger on it
913.52s: until afterwards, I realized, wait, this
916.24s: is 3 years to the very night to the very
919.92s: night after those those Belgium
922.16s: sightings. And there were absolutely
924.88s: similarities in the shape of the the
928.08s: craft. Sometimes the behavior this
930.80s: ability apparent ability of it to move
934.88s: from a very low speed to high max speeds
938.80s: in an instant with no sonic boom. Lou
941.60s: Alzando would would call this the you
944.56s: know one of the five observables. And we
947.68s: didn't have that terminology at the
949.52s: time, but we knew what it was because it
952.16s: it cropped up in cases like this. And I
954.96s: remember one of the Air Force
957.72s: witnesses telling me that this thing
960.40s: moved very slowly, maybe 35, 40 m an
963.92s: hour, uh, with a low frequency humming
966.72s: sound that he said was deeply
968.56s: unpleasant. You could feel it as well as
970.96s: hear it rather like getting too close to
973.04s: a like a a generator or something.
975.12s: generator, a bass speaker at a rock
978.24s: concert, something like that, where you
980.00s: feel the sound going through your body.
982.88s: He said it was like that. And this is an
984.96s: Air Force guy telling me this, like just
987.52s: a few hours after he saw it. And he said
990.32s: from that very slow speed, suddenly it
992.72s: just went away to the horizon like in in
995.60s: an instant. And he said, "Nick," and
998.64s: this was maybe I don't know just five,
1002.24s: six hours afterwards, we were on the
1004.72s: phone, his voice was still shaking. And
1006.88s: he said, "Nick, I've been in the Air
1008.64s: Force 8 years. I see obviously fast
1011.20s: attack helicopters, mil jets, like it's
1014.24s: my job. I've never seen anything like
1016.64s: this before in my life."
1019.72s: Wow. I mean, that's that's incredible
1022.56s: coming from such, you know, such a
1024.48s: credible witness. Um, and then the
1027.36s: corroborative evidence. Now, did you you
1030.40s: obviously picked up some of that on
1031.68s: radar as well. We did have some radar
1034.84s: data. It it was inconclusive. There were
1038.40s: some uncorrelated targets near, you
1041.84s: know, some of the the radar heads had
1044.16s: picked something up, but it you couldn't
1047.04s: hang your hat on it. I see. And, you
1049.68s: know, doesn't surprise me. I mean, we we
1052.16s: do stealth. So, so it's it can be done.
1056.40s: Yeah, that's uh I mean, stealth has a
1059.20s: large part of stealth as well is the
1061.16s: altitude, right? So, if these things are
1063.68s: are not too high in the sky as well,
1066.00s: they would be harder to pick up by
1067.28s: radar, wouldn't they? Yes. I mean, our
1069.92s: radar systems, particularly our military
1072.32s: ones, are are configured for very
1075.12s: specific threats and and so they they
1078.88s: are looking in certain directions at
1081.68s: certain heights. Um, it's not to say
1083.92s: they can't do other things, but you you
1086.56s: have that. Then you have the fact that a
1088.32s: lot of them use filter programs. This
1090.40s: was a big problem for us because the
1093.56s: mindset as much as anything else is
1096.64s: that, you know, things don't come from
1099.52s: straight up down. Um, you know, you're
1103.04s: you're looking, like I say, at very
1104.96s: specific
1106.56s: things, you know, most of which at the
1108.72s: time were were like Soviet Union Warsaw
1111.20s: packed. So, your system isn't configured
1115.36s: to to look for things just coming in out
1118.08s: of the atmosphere. Then you use these
1120.96s: filter programs and it's it's based on a
1124.40s: mindset assumption. Well, if it isn't
1127.12s: behaving like a conventional aircraft,
1130.00s: then it's probably just a ghost return.
1132.48s: I see. And and you you wonder, are we
1135.68s: throwing out the baby with the bath
1137.20s: water here? Yeah. And that's I think
1140.00s: what made your job so important is is
1142.08s: looking at those anomalies. And you know
1144.48s: that this brings me to a really
1146.48s: interesting point that I've pondered
1147.84s: quite a bit as well. Being people who
1149.84s: are interested in these fringe
1151.88s: anomalies, we are a little bit more
1154.72s: prone to well, we have to be to looking
1158.64s: at all of the anomalies that are
1161.12s: associated with it. So, for instance, a
1163.12s: lot of people avoid the UFO uh spike on
1166.72s: the chart, but for those of us focusing
1168.80s: in on that, well, there are an infinite
1170.88s: amount of spikes in that category. I
1173.92s: mean, the anomalies don't just cease at
1176.96s: a UFO. they go into beings and and
1180.24s: physical, metaphysical, all these other
1182.16s: fringe um sort of things. So, was there
1185.36s: ever a point during your time there
1188.16s: where you had to pull your punches a
1190.96s: little bit with what you thought was
1192.80s: going on? 100% yes. Um you have to play
1198.00s: the strongest hand that you have,
1201.12s: particularly if you are looking to get
1202.96s: access to defense ministers.
1205.92s: uh if if you want more resources,
1209.20s: uh you you just have to focus in on the
1213.68s: sorts of cases that you know will play
1215.52s: well. So you talk about the pilot
1217.68s: sightings, you talk about the cases
1219.76s: where you have radar data, you don't
1222.16s: tend to talk about the abduction cases
1224.32s: even though you have them. So you kind
1226.64s: of self censor which in a way it was one
1230.80s: of the most uncomfortable things of all
1234.16s: because the phenomenon I soon realized
1237.08s: was you know multiaceted and truly
1241.68s: bizarre and sometimes almost abstract
1244.40s: but you had to kind of play it very
1246.24s: straight and focus in on this the sort
1249.04s: of defense national security pilots
1251.52s: radar kind of thing and we still see
1253.76s: that I mean ATIP and also that that you
1256.80s: mentioned. I mean, ORSAP looked at some
1259.20s: really weird stuff, but they had to kind
1261.52s: of dress it up in a certain way to get
1264.56s: congressional funding and and that
1266.88s: relates to why we changed the language
1269.60s: even from UFO to UAP. It was all about
1272.80s: getting rid of that pop culture baggage
1275.76s: and rebranding the conversation. Yeah.
1279.68s: But with that pop culture baggage, you'd
1281.84s: mentioned throwing the baby out with the
1283.28s: bathwater. Um, you know, I would like to
1285.76s: believe
1287.16s: that that all of these multiaceted
1292.20s: um, uh, sort of subjects that revolve
1295.20s: around
1296.52s: UAP are also to some extent should be a
1301.12s: concern to national security because
1303.36s: when we're talking about abductions,
1305.52s: although might be fringe, when you have
1308.24s: thousands of people who are reporting
1310.40s: these things and reporting similar
1312.00s: things, I mean, you would assume assume
1314.48s: that these conversations should be
1316.88s: happening behind closed doors as well as
1319.60s: invading our airspace.
1321.84s: 100%. Yeah. and and you know I know from
1325.04s: more recent conversations with people
1327.44s: like Lu Alzando and Jay Stratton and and
1330.80s: that obviously the UAP task force in the
1333.44s: United States ATIP and ORSAT they had
1336.56s: those cases or they they were certainly
1338.48s: aware of those cases but even they had
1342.64s: to kind of play on well yeah David Fraor
1345.44s: the tic tac um you again it's it's
1348.88s: playing your strongest suit. Yeah, I
1352.16s: just find it so um so wild because uh
1355.28s: you know these abduction cases
1357.24s: specifically go back decades and decades
1359.92s: and decades. It's not like they've gone
1361.28s: away and there was a time where they
1363.36s: were seemingly more rampant, but um it
1366.64s: is for me, you know, thinking about that
1369.36s: stuff if if this is happening, I mean,
1371.60s: that is a complete violation of human
1374.08s: rights. that is just, you know, and
1376.32s: obviously if they're non-human, then
1377.68s: they, you know, they they can disregard
1379.36s: that. But, um, I I take issue with it
1382.80s: because I feel like it's such an
1384.72s: invasive,
1386.72s: um, procedure that happens during these
1388.80s: abductions versus just coming into our
1390.72s: airspace. I understand the, you know,
1392.72s: the military implications, but, um, some
1395.68s: of these cases that you visited, um,
1398.60s: where, you know, people were potentially
1401.52s: abducted or had, uh, encounters with
1405.36s: beings. What was one of the cases that
1407.92s: really left you, I mean, struck by the
1410.88s: information that you were that you were
1412.64s: uncovering?
1414.16s: Well, this is another area where where
1416.80s: there is kind of selfcensorship, but
1420.00s: interestingly, you even find it in
1422.44s: eupfology. I guess I I suppose if you
1425.60s: talk to um abduction researchers and and
1429.92s: back in the day, I suppose the big three
1432.80s: were Bud Hopkins, John Mack, and David
1435.56s: Jacobs. Um and I I
1439.92s: met all all three of them. I I knew B
1443.84s: and John Mack quite quite well. I mean,
1446.88s: you know, we we talked about, you know,
1449.76s: some of the cases and things like that,
1452.48s: but even within Euphology, you often
1456.00s: find this selfcensorship. And it's only
1458.64s: when you talk to the actual experiences,
1461.60s: I I people like Willie Streber that you
1464.08s: realize how truly bizarre and abstract
1467.52s: the phenomenon can be because you have
1471.04s: just as I talked about playing the
1472.88s: strongest suit in government UAP work.
1476.64s: You even find it with the UFO
1478.00s: researchers and it's it's like, yeah, I
1479.60s: have a case. It's it's the little grays
1482.08s: on a table. Some of the cases that I got
1485.68s: were not like that. There was one. Can
1487.60s: you go into them? Yeah, that would be
1488.72s: great. Well, one one to answer your
1492.08s: question about that left an impression
1493.60s: on me was it wasn't really an abduction,
1496.72s: but it was an encounter with I guess
1501.00s: beings. a particular uh woman who I I
1504.32s: got to know quite well uh had this
1507.12s: experience that a whole bunch of
1511.48s: apparently, you know, normallooking
1513.96s: people all walked into an art shop in
1518.08s: central
1519.00s: London, started looking at all the
1522.44s: produce, were there for like a long
1525.60s: time, and and she she just felt there
1528.08s: was something weird about these people.
1530.64s: And then after a long time they made a
1533.36s: big show of coming up and buying a
1535.44s: single pencil like it was like a big
1539.00s: thing. And then they handed over a very
1541.60s: high denomination bank note. And when
1544.88s: the woman went to give them their
1547.04s: change, they they looked confused like
1550.32s: they didn't understand the concept of
1552.64s: getting their change bag. And she was so
1556.08s: struck by this that she phoned somebody
1559.04s: afterwards and in fact during this whole
1562.72s: thing and said there are aliens in my
1565.32s: shop. And and that's the kind of surreal
1570.60s: nature of of these encounters that
1573.52s: sometimes doesn't even come out in the
1575.60s: literature because I think sometimes
1578.12s: euphologists self censor because they
1581.36s: say look everyone knows what an alien
1583.68s: looks like. Everyone knows what an
1585.12s: abduction is. It's a very structured
1587.12s: thing. The beam, the table, the medical
1589.40s: exam. When you get something like this
1591.60s: that doesn't fit the model, euphologist
1594.40s: self censor and throw it out. But me
1597.36s: being a kind of I I don't know, a sort
1599.52s: of evenhanded like disinterested
1603.60s: um kind of observer of this. I take all
1608.08s: the cases that I can get. And so that
1611.52s: was one that really struck me. Um, so
1613.68s: you said you got to know this woman
1615.12s: quite well. Um, was that afterwards? Did
1618.00s: she have any other encounters?
1621.60s: One that I would say was more of a time
1624.76s: slip kind of phenomenon. Missing time,
1629.96s: seeing somebody that looked like herself
1633.20s: from the future. Whoa. and and
1636.52s: and it's it's again I often find that
1640.56s: the high strangeness of these cases is
1644.16s: is under reportported. Yeah. I mean some
1646.80s: of it I use the word surreal quite
1649.68s: deliberately. The the true phenomenon I
1652.48s: think is much more surreal. I mean we of
1655.60s: course look we can only look at all of
1658.16s: this in a very anthropocentric way. If
1661.60s: we are dealing with something truly
1663.28s: alien, then it doesn't surprise me in a
1665.68s: way that it is alien. Yeah, good point.
1668.80s: Um, you know, all of that I mean it's so
1671.84s: interesting because obviously like you
1673.84s: said we are sort of accustomed to seeing
1675.76s: to hearing about the small grays, the
1677.12s: tall grays, maybe the mantis folk, some
1679.12s: reptilians here and there, even Nordic
1681.28s: folk. Uh, but um, more rarely and
1684.48s: probably possibly harder to detect are
1687.68s: what seem to be these hybrids. um in in
1691.28s: this case um of course if you're aware
1693.76s: of the work of David Jacobs you know
1695.52s: he's written books like the threat and
1697.76s: um the other one was like among among us
1699.60s: or they're Among Us um really
1702.84s: highlighted sort of these tales or these
1705.36s: stories by
1706.92s: abductees who were led to train a lot of
1711.68s: these later stage hybrids that have been
1714.64s: interacting with you know human society
1716.96s: and train them in the most mundane ways
1720.00s: which I thought was really a fascinating
1721.92s: read. And this strikes me as like one of
1724.32s: those things especially they were they
1726.40s: would do this in groups and for them to
1729.20s: go out alone
1731.36s: uh and not guided by an abductee or a
1734.00s: human to help them you know understand
1735.84s: what is happening um is just really
1737.92s: strange as well. Um, but that type of
1740.52s: behavior, the monetary exchange with a
1743.28s: large denomination, not knowing what to
1744.88s: do with the change, uh, these things all
1747.36s: sound like what David Jacobs, uh, what
1749.20s: the witnesses in the books that David
1750.56s: Jacobs wrote described, uh, which is
1752.64s: really fascinating. Did had you ever
1754.72s: encountered more of these sort of
1757.32s: humanlooking quote unquote aliens? Yes.
1760.60s: Um, you know, quite a few instances over
1764.08s: the years and it it doesn't surprise me.
1766.40s: I mean again if what we are dealing with
1768.88s: here is extraterrestrial visitation and
1771.76s: I'm I'm conscious that there are
1774.00s: competing theories out there you know
1776.16s: time travelers from the future something
1778.48s: from other dimensions but if if we are
1781.60s: dealing with something that is
1782.72s: extraterrestrial
1784.40s: um then then absolutely this is is going
1787.28s: to be sort of multifaceted and and why
1790.32s: would we think that any civilization
1792.32s: with the technology to travel between
1794.08s: the stars couldn't figure out a way of
1796.64s: walking among us. Yeah, it's it's
1799.68s: unsettling to say the least. I mean, um,
1801.52s: you know, David Jacobs in those books,
1803.60s: he'd also, you know, hinted at the at
1805.76s: the idea of like if there was some type
1807.60s: of takeover, you know, hypothetically,
1810.64s: by these
1812.12s: extraterrestrials, it wouldn't be so
1814.08s: hostile. They'd be smart enough to sort
1815.92s: of introduce themselves into our society
1817.76s: without us knowing. and and and sort of
1820.16s: uh that seems like a much more favorable
1822.56s: way to uh take over the resources that
1825.92s: we have here rather than destroy
1827.36s: everything or or enslave everyone. It's
1829.68s: it's this like slow sort of integration
1832.88s: into you know into our society. And it
1836.00s: points to a lot of these experiments
1837.92s: done on board with these abductees um
1840.72s: you know the genetic experiments and
1843.12s: like what Whitley Streber gone through
1844.80s: and and and similar similar things to
1847.36s: that. So, I mean, those things
1850.40s: potentially, the fringe cases, I think,
1852.16s: fascinate me a lot more than, you know,
1854.88s: hearing about uh the these other type of
1857.68s: aliens, although equally fascinating.
1860.08s: Um, was there ever was there ever any
1863.28s: witnesses that you encountered that had
1866.24s: seen um your typical
1870.04s: alien? Sure. Yeah. I I had cases like
1873.04s: that and people people would talk about
1875.36s: the the so-called grays, but a lot of
1878.68s: this was under hypnosis and obviously
1881.84s: there are some issues with that in terms
1884.24s: of false memory syndrome and and just
1887.04s: kind of cultural contamination. The the
1890.00s: image of a gray is now so firmly
1893.52s: embedded in people's minds that it's
1896.24s: it's maybe sort of almost like a default
1899.36s: go-to thing. It's like if if somebody's
1902.32s: abducted, oh yeah, it was the grays. And
1904.40s: you wonder again, like any civilization
1907.92s: with that technology probably can can
1911.04s: appear to us however they like or can
1914.88s: make us see things that are not there.
1917.36s: And and it almost becomes I'll I'll use
1920.08s: this analogy with you deliberately, but
1922.40s: like the magician's trick. You know,
1924.32s: you're looking at the hand that the
1926.96s: magician is is saying, but what you
1929.20s: should really be looking at is what the
1930.72s: other hand is doing.
1932.88s: Masters of subtrafuge are these entities
1936.28s: potentially. Um, you know, and and
1938.48s: that's interesting because, you know, we
1940.32s: as as humans also deal in subtrifuge
1943.68s: um towards, you know, our own kind um
1947.28s: especially in these government uh
1949.12s: positions. You know, there's often
1950.88s: national security risks that we have to
1952.64s: hide. there's often these cases that we
1954.88s: can't let the public know about. Was did
1957.36s: you ever feel like during your time that
1960.32s: there was actively information being
1964.40s: suppressed at some level that you were
1966.96s: denied access
1968.52s: to? It's difficult because you you can't
1971.84s: prove a
1972.92s: negative. I actually felt that I had
1977.04s: access to everything I needed. Certainly
1979.84s: in the UK I didn't feel that there was I
1983.84s: don't know another
1985.56s: organization in the shadows because they
1988.32s: would have needed access to the data and
1990.40s: and also I had both the security
1993.28s: clearance and the need to know um when
1997.84s: for example the secretary of state for
2000.28s: defense answered questions in parliament
2003.04s: about this I was the person that would
2005.36s: have to to draft the replies. So as the
2009.04s: subject matter expert, I believe that I
2011.68s: had total access. Of course, you know,
2014.16s: you can never say never. What I felt
2016.80s: that was an issue was the United States
2021.04s: because even myself doing that job in
2024.56s: government, I could not get access to
2027.20s: what the
2028.12s: US knew and was doing about this. And
2031.28s: and I was told frankly the same as
2034.80s: everyone else was told. No, no, there's
2036.80s: no program. Nobody's doing anything. We
2040.00s: haven't done anything since Bluebook was
2041.60s: shut down at the end of
2043.48s: 69. Now we know that that's obviously
2046.80s: was not true and clearly you wouldn't
2050.00s: you know you have ATIP and Osat before
2053.20s: that obviously there were other things
2055.20s: you wouldn't have a gap where this
2057.44s: wasn't being done. So I felt that if if
2062.08s: anything was being hidden from me it was
2064.16s: what the United States was up to. It's
2067.04s: it's the one area where the so-called
2070.16s: special relationship, right, didn't
2072.72s: really work. And there was never a time
2074.72s: where you thought that perhaps there was
2077.28s: some other um foreign government sort of
2081.60s: impeding or involving themselves in your
2084.80s: work.
2086.08s: No, we knew through intelligence sources
2090.72s: that Russia and China had a program had
2094.40s: had separate programs looking at this,
2097.36s: but we didn't really know the details of
2099.28s: that and we didn't feel that there was
2100.80s: any active interference from them in our
2104.40s: program.
2106.48s: Had you heard of any crash um retrievals
2109.52s: done in the UK?
2112.16s: some rumors, but nothing you could hang
2114.96s: your hat on. And I I was not convinced
2118.08s: by by any of those cases. We we had a
2121.52s: case from the early
2123.80s: 1970s where something was alleged to
2126.32s: have crashed in Wales on Berwin
2129.48s: Mountain. Uh there was another rumor
2131.92s: about a crash in the Peak District in
2134.96s: the north of England. But I I looked at
2138.32s: that and of course I had access to all
2140.32s: the the historical files on all this.
2144.84s: Nothing nothing convinced me that there
2147.52s: had been any UK crashes. I see. Very
2151.68s: interesting. Thank you so much for
2152.88s: answering uh those questions.
2156.60s: Um I'm going to move on
2159.40s: to past the UFO desk. As much as I could
2162.64s: probably spend the entire podcast
2164.08s: discussing a lot of what went on there.
2166.16s: Um, but I'd like to move perhaps back in
2168.72s: time a little bit to December 26th,
2172.04s: 1980. Uh, the famous Rendlessham
2175.96s: case. Okay, we're looking at the thing.
2178.00s: We're probably about 2 to 300 yards
2179.68s: away. It looks like an eye winking at
2181.20s: you. It's still moving from side to
2182.64s: side. Like the pupil eye looking at you
2184.96s: and winking and the flash is so bright
2186.88s: to the starcope that uh it almost burns
2189.12s: your eye. Now we've got an object about
2191.12s: 10° directly south. until he's off the
2193.36s: horizon. And the ones the north are
2195.60s: moving, one's moving away from us. Okay,
2198.40s: here. Here he comes from the south. He's
2199.76s: coming toward us now.
2201.84s: Now we're observing what appears to be a
2203.28s: beam coming down to the
2205.48s: ground. This is unreal. Coming on board,
2209.28s: even at the UFO desk or from the
2211.60s: Ministry of Defense, had you prior to
2214.88s: this, had you heard about Rendlessham
2217.28s: and and the incident that happened
2218.64s: there? No, I hadn't. Mhm. I I think the
2222.48s: only UFO case that I had heard of before
2225.76s: I got this job. I mean I when I was put
2228.48s: on that position, I had no knowledge or
2230.96s: interest in this phenomenon, which is
2233.16s: probably the way they wanted it, but
2235.44s: also the best way to be. You don't want
2237.44s: to come into a job like that encumbered
2239.84s: with baggage, whether it's whether it's
2242.64s: as a true believer or as a diehard
2244.88s: debunker. The only case I'd ever heard
2247.20s: of was probably Roswell and he so
2250.00s: Rendlessham. No. And almost literally on
2253.04s: day one in that job, one of the things I
2255.04s: started to do was was go back through
2257.60s: the files that we had in our office.
2260.24s: Obviously, there were files dating back
2262.16s: to the Second World War that that I
2264.32s: looked at later. But there was one, you
2267.76s: know, sat there and I pulled it out and
2270.32s: it said Rendlessham Forest, December
2273.76s: 1980. And I was like, "Wait, what's
2276.08s: this?" And my predecessor when I was
2279.68s: taking the job, you know, you you have a
2281.52s: handover. And he said, "Well, that's I
2284.16s: guess the the kind of crown jewels that
2286.72s: it's it's the case nobody could
2288.80s: explain." And so I'm leafing through and
2291.20s: I'm like, "Wait, what? The the deputy
2293.28s: base commander saw this as well. Wait,
2296.80s: what's this in in, you know, what's this
2299.60s: document on US Air Force, you know,
2303.08s: letterhead saying that something landed
2305.76s: and and wait, what's this about
2307.44s: radioactivity levels at the landing site
2310.48s: and yeah, so the more I looked into it,
2314.72s: the the more bizarre it got. And um
2318.24s: obviously looking was this was this ear
2320.56s: this was probably earlier in your uh
2322.72s: time at the UFO desk then that that you
2324.64s: were looking into Randle Shump correct.
2326.32s: Uh yeah I mean I was aware of it almost
2328.64s: from from day one because it it was part
2331.84s: of the handover brief that I got from my
2334.28s: predecessor but as I went on in that job
2338.96s: we were still for example getting media
2341.28s: inquiries about it. We were still
2343.12s: getting members of parliament
2345.12s: occasionally raising questions about it.
2348.40s: And at a certain point, I thought,
2350.64s: right, I need to do what cops would call
2353.60s: a a a cold case review. Go through the
2357.60s: data that we have, see what we
2361.16s: missed, you know, and and that's what I
2364.24s: did. A real X file. Yes. A real life
2367.36s: real life X file. And I I use this
2371.04s: analogy of of police and actually it's
2374.64s: quite a good one I think because a UFO
2377.40s: investigation has a lot of similarities
2380.00s: with a police investigation because the
2382.88s: two strands of it are you identify and
2385.52s: interview witnesses and you secure and
2388.32s: analyze evidence
2391.20s: and and then then it's almost like you
2393.36s: got a list of suspects. You know
2395.36s: intellectually that most UFOs have
2398.40s: conventional explanations and so you try
2401.28s: and think well what could it have been
2403.76s: and and you check for for you know
2406.52s: aircraft, military exercises,
2409.32s: satellites, meteors and one by one you
2412.80s: eliminate those or or most times of
2414.88s: course you don't. Most time you find a
2417.12s: match and you're like okay this this is
2419.52s: the explanation or the likely
2421.04s: explanation whatever it might be. But
2423.76s: the cases like Randlessham, you go
2426.08s: through all that and you still come up
2429.32s: blank. Okay. So after all the
2432.16s: accumulated knowledge that you've had
2434.24s: in, you know, your years studying UFOs
2437.52s: and the phenomenon, looking back at the
2440.00s: investigation of Rendlessham, would you
2442.40s: say that they did an adequate job
2445.20s: investigating it or what would you have
2448.40s: done in that position to give yourself a
2452.40s: little bit more information knowing what
2453.52s: you know now about UFOs?
2456.48s: The investigation was completely
2459.64s: mishandled for a number of reasons. And
2462.48s: again, they are two things that often
2466.32s: sabotage a police investigation. Two two
2469.76s: things that any cop will tell you if if
2472.32s: something goes wrong, these two things
2474.40s: are usually the problem. The first was a
2478.40s: jurisdictional dog fight. Basically,
2481.52s: these were US bases on British soil. So
2485.68s: you you had this kind of well who's got
2488.40s: jurisdiction, who's got primacy. Um some
2492.08s: things the US military did, some things
2494.64s: the British Ministry of Defense did. And
2497.44s: allied to that, the second problem is
2500.48s: poor information sharing. Again, just an
2504.96s: unrelated example, but one of the
2507.12s: lessons of 911 was that all sorts of
2512.68s: intelligence agencies or or parts of the
2515.76s: government that had access to
2517.04s: intelligence had intelligence but didn't
2520.16s: share it. So FBI had something that CIA
2524.24s: would have wanted to know and vice
2526.56s: versa. that happened with Rendlessham
2529.20s: that that we had this this kind of US
2532.72s: government doing its thing, British
2534.48s: government doing its thing. Everyone was
2536.88s: kind of, you know, secretive and holding
2540.32s: their cards close to their chest or
2543.64s: vest, which whichever saying you use.
2546.88s: And and so a lot of things fell between
2549.44s: the cracks.
2551.76s: Oh, and delay because this happened over
2555.76s: Christmas. Ah, right. A lot of people
2558.64s: were on leave and it sounds like a silly
2561.36s: thing, but actually particularly back
2564.40s: when I was doing this job, but
2566.40s: particularly before this Rendlessham
2569.20s: 1980, um, you know, before the internet
2572.48s: and before email, before the 24/7 news
2576.24s: cycle, before social media, the fact
2579.04s: that something like this would happen
2580.32s: over the Christmas break when a lot of
2582.24s: key people were on leave was a much
2584.80s: bigger deal than it might sound. That is
2587.84s: true. It's almost uh serendipitously
2590.64s: uh done almost maybe even deliberately
2593.04s: during that time. You know, a lot of
2595.28s: these UFO cases and visitations are done
2598.24s: in remote areas. They're not they're
2601.20s: rarely done in crowded places. And so,
2603.92s: it probably would be a little it would
2606.24s: make a little bit more sense that it
2607.60s: would be done in a remote area, but also
2610.48s: in, you know, a time where there are
2612.24s: less uh witnesses.
2615.16s: However, what's interesting with
2617.20s: Rendlessham is the people that involved.
2619.44s: So, Jim Pennson, John Burroughs, and
2621.68s: obviously uh deputy base commander uh
2623.84s: Charles Halt.
2626.04s: Uh these were all active duty military
2631.16s: personnel. Do you think that there
2634.76s: is reason to believe that that was
2637.88s: intentional? that the this encounter
2640.80s: somehow lent itself uh a little bit more
2644.52s: to you know the narrative that that
2646.80s: there is some type of communication
2648.40s: between military and UFOs.
2651.60s: Yes, I think so. And I'll directly quote
2655.84s: Colonel Halt here and I I know all three
2658.80s: of those people very well and and of
2660.96s: course I wrote a book with John Burrows
2663.36s: and Jim Penniston. that Colonel Halt um
2666.64s: when he talks about seeing the UFO on
2670.16s: the third of the three nights of
2671.88s: activity, he talks about it zipping
2675.04s: around in the sky like it was doing a
2676.72s: grid search. But he says that at one
2678.48s: point in the encounter, a beam of light
2681.28s: came down and and struck the
2683.56s: ground you in front of him and the half
2687.12s: dozen or so people he' taken out into
2688.88s: the forest to investigate this. And he
2691.28s: said, looking back on this, he said,
2693.92s: "Was this a weapon? Was this a warning?
2697.92s: Or was this
2699.88s: communication?" And he he doesn't know
2703.20s: the answer to that, but he said, "Well,
2705.92s: whatever it was, it was under
2708.16s: intelligent control." M and again for
2712.24s: this to
2713.48s: happen right next to Bentwaters and
2716.80s: Woodbridge these two military bases
2719.52s: separated by Randles forest yes it's
2722.24s: remote but these at the time were two of
2724.96s: the most strategically important bases
2727.68s: in the entire NATO military alliance and
2732.16s: this was a time December
2734.60s: 1980 when and not a lot of people know
2739.44s: Yes, but when we probably came closer to
2742.32s: nuclear war than any other time since
2745.52s: the Cuban missile crisis, we according
2748.72s: to some military
2750.12s: historians, we were very close. And this
2752.64s: was because of what was going on in
2754.32s: Poland with the the trade union
2757.24s: solidarity. And there is intelligence
2760.32s: that suggests that the Soviets had told
2763.28s: the the Polish government, you deal with
2766.24s: this. if you don't deal with it, we
2769.28s: will. And that they had a a winter
2772.36s: exercise regularly scheduled, which was
2775.60s: a buildup of troops, and they practiced
2778.56s: sort of transition to war. But there is
2782.16s: intelligence that suggests that this
2784.40s: time they were saying this exercise is
2786.48s: going to turn into the real thing unless
2788.88s: the situation in Poland is resolved. and
2791.36s: Reynolds Forest of course played itself
2794.12s: out to this backstory. This this was the
2797.88s: geopolitical situation at the time. Were
2800.40s: there are there nuclear um are there
2803.28s: nuclear arms in that region? You know,
2805.68s: that's we've hit one of those um NCND
2809.92s: moments. I can neither confirm nor deny.
2812.88s: Yeah, it it would make a lot of sense
2814.64s: looking at even the recent activity in
2816.48s: Lake and Heath and even going back to
2819.20s: you know uh Rendlessham the amount of
2823.28s: um I mean just even stateside and I
2826.72s: think even in Russia you know these
2828.96s: things are highly interested intrigued
2832.00s: curious or perhaps even wary of our
2834.80s: nuclear capabilities whether that's um
2838.00s: whether that's you know having nuclear
2840.08s: meltdowns at these facilities or the
2842.56s: place where we house nuclear, you know,
2844.76s: bombs. Um, I mean, that would be that
2848.96s: would potentially be one of the reasons
2850.80s: why this craft was in the area. Again,
2853.68s: we have to be wary of anthropocentrism.
2858.04s: But, you know, there is a certain if if
2861.20s: you're kind of saying what assumptions
2863.92s: could we make about visiting
2865.92s: extraterrestrials or or a non-human
2868.24s: intelligence, if you want to use that
2869.68s: phrase, one of the good assumptions
2871.44s: would be they would be interested in the
2873.28s: cutting edge of our technology,
2875.60s: particularly if it's a technology that
2878.32s: we we could literally, you know, induce
2881.52s: an extinction level event. And and you
2885.04s: know the shorthand for this would be
2888.32s: that other civilizations would look
2890.80s: perhaps at the Trinity test in 45 and
2895.52s: and then Hiroshima or Nagasaki and say
2899.12s: the kids have found the matches. That's
2901.20s: right. Yeah. And I mean, you know, if
2903.20s: you're looking, you know, what other
2904.96s: possible explanations could you find for
2906.96s: a UFO being interested uh in this area
2910.24s: with these military personnel? I mean,
2912.48s: there's no, you know, they weren't doing
2914.96s: C5 out there. No. And and we've been
2917.60s: aware of this UFO nuclear connection for
2920.16s: for years, of course.
2922.36s: Um,
2923.88s: Malstrom 1967, May not 1967. Um, did the
2930.08s: case another case from actually Ukraine
2934.24s: I think I think in ' 82. That was the
2936.88s: one. That was the really scary one
2938.72s: because of course in a lot of these
2940.60s: cases the allegation is that the nukes
2944.56s: were shut down. Maybe as a demonstration
2947.36s: of strength, maybe as a warning,
2949.04s: whatever. But in this Ukraine case from
2951.76s: 1982, of course, the the missiles were
2954.48s: put into their pre-launch sequence, and
2957.68s: that was truly scary. Yeah, that's uh
2959.92s: that's definitely terrifying. Shutting
2961.84s: them down is scary, but turning them on
2963.20s: is even scarier, I think. Yeah. the and
2965.68s: the guy one one of the the main
2967.76s: witnesses to this his hair turned white.
2972.16s: I mean literally it's one of those
2973.60s: medical things that that apparently
2976.72s: shock can do this but the next day his
2980.00s: hair was white. Wow. And yeah, never
2983.52s: never went back.
2986.00s: Stress related or I mean yeah, he he
2988.24s: literally thought that on his
2990.84s: watch the third world war was going to
2993.36s: start because of something weird
2995.76s: happening to the nuclear weapons that
2997.60s: was not you know that the high command
3000.56s: had not given a launch order or
3003.44s: anything. So this was like he thought on
3005.92s: his watch some bizarre accident and yes
3010.16s: of course there was a UFO sighting in
3012.56s: relation to this and that's what you
3015.68s: know triggered the the stress and the
3017.36s: fear. Wow. Um that's really that's I
3022.08s: mean that's really that's one of those
3023.44s: wild again one of those fringe sort of
3025.20s: cases that you're like what how does
3026.56s: that fit into anywhere? Exactly. And
3028.56s: this is one of the reasons why the
3029.76s: United States Congress has as one of the
3032.72s: many things that they've asked the
3034.64s: Department of Defense to do is it's like
3037.04s: they've asked the question, hey look, we
3038.64s: are aware of this UFO nuclear
3041.52s: connection.
3043.04s: go find out whether this is a real thing
3046.16s: or the skeptical theory is that some of
3048.64s: this is is um collection bias that
3053.52s: nuclear facilities are by their very
3055.92s: nature more heavily surveiled.
3058.08s: Therefore, it's maybe more
3059.36s: proportionally likely that if there's a
3061.12s: UFO sighting, it will be picked up. But
3064.08s: but obviously some of the things we've
3065.60s: discussed go over and above that. Yeah.
3067.68s: No, understandably. Um, if you could ask
3071.20s: sort of one candid off thereord question
3075.28s: to any of the witnesses at
3077.80s: Rendlessham, what question would that
3080.76s: be? It would be, "What didn't you put in
3083.68s: the official report?" Because again,
3086.56s: people self censor. Even with something
3089.68s: as bizarre as this, you know, one of the
3092.72s: reasons that people like John Burrows
3094.64s: and Jim Penniston could speak out was
3097.20s: that the deputy base commander Charles
3099.36s: Halt had seen it too. So they kind of
3101.76s: felt, okay, the boss has seen it. So
3104.72s: there's no there's no
3106.52s: shame in in saying, "Yeah, I I saw a
3110.92s: UFO, but they self censored." And Jim
3114.00s: Penniston, as we know, self-censored the
3116.64s: the whole business of of touching the
3119.12s: binary code, the binary code. This this
3122.00s: sort of, as he puts it, almost like a
3124.80s: telepathic download of data that he got.
3128.72s: I still wonder, to answer your question,
3132.56s: which other witnesses
3134.76s: selfensored? What What didn't some of
3137.84s: the others put in the official report?
3141.04s: Is there anything you're aware of?
3143.64s: No, no. I if I had to guess, I would say
3149.28s: that with some of the things coming out
3150.88s: now, it it relates to health issues. I
3153.92s: see.
3155.00s: Um there's a line a throwaway line in a
3159.28s: British not American interestingly
3161.60s: British intelligence assessment of UAP
3164.56s: as a whole throwaway line on Rendlessham
3167.12s: which says you this this is a case where
3170.40s: it might be postulated that the
3173.60s: witnesses were exposed to UAP radiation
3177.52s: for longer periods than normal
3180.56s: and that crops up again in ATIP and
3183.60s: ORSAP in one of the papers that they did
3186.24s: about human effects. But all this is
3190.44s: very, you know, sensitive.
3193.92s: Yeah. Kind of like I say, people self
3196.68s: censor. So you have to dress it up as I
3199.92s: mean you if you're reading this report,
3202.32s: it's dressed up as sort of physiological
3204.56s: effects of exposure to
3207.96s: UAP and and it sounds very sort of dry.
3212.24s: And then you read between the lines and
3214.00s: it's wait that this is a government
3216.00s: document basically about close
3217.84s: encounters right yeah and I mean the
3220.80s: work that uh Dr. Gary Nolan is doing to,
3223.44s: you know, study these physiological
3225.68s: effects and, you know, corroborating a
3227.76s: lot of what David Grush came out and
3230.00s: said, uh, publicly and even what Lu
3231.84s: Alzando had spoken about that there is,
3234.64s: you know, this danger in, uh,
3237.12s: interacting with this phenomenon that is
3239.28s: sort of an offset perhaps from the
3241.28s: propulsion or whatever they, you know,
3243.12s: end up using. Yes, we don't think it's
3245.52s: deliberate. Yeah, it does, as you say,
3248.08s: it seems it seems to be leakage, right?
3250.80s: except uh I mean that the case in Brazil
3254.00s: I think would be maybe the exception to
3256.00s: that. Yes. But then yeah, if you're
3259.76s: looking at a whole range of data, there
3261.60s: are always going to be outliers and
3264.16s: yeah, for for whatever reason. And
3266.24s: sometimes that's that's where you should
3268.00s: look. Yeah, perhaps. And and again, like
3270.16s: you mentioned at the top, this is
3272.08s: perhaps just a plethora of, you know,
3274.24s: different encounters. We don't know.
3276.08s: Like I I always like to think that like
3278.00s: it's either it's either zero or a
3280.60s: million. You know, if if we're thinking
3282.64s: of like species in the known galaxy or
3285.68s: even, you know, interacting with Earth,
3288.80s: it's either nothing or everything
3291.36s: because it's such a vast universe in
3293.68s: that like if one of them through these
3296.08s: billions of years discovered that
3297.76s: technology, then a million of them did.
3299.92s: Yes. That's kind of where I sit with
3302.00s: that. Absolutely. um in a universe
3305.12s: nearly 14 billion years old, there might
3307.76s: be civilizations out there a billion
3310.24s: years ahead of us. And like like you
3313.20s: say, the the statistical chances of
3316.40s: there only being two civilizations in
3319.12s: the universe, us plus one are, I think,
3322.32s: as as ridiculously long odds as the idea
3325.68s: that we'd be alone. And the more we find
3327.92s: out about the
3329.48s: universe, the more ordinary we look. And
3332.40s: I guess it's the copian principle that
3334.48s: you're probably somewhere in the middle.
3336.48s: So there are probably emerging
3338.08s: civilizations much more primitive than
3340.00s: us. But conversely, like I say, in a
3342.48s: universe this old, even with the cycles
3344.72s: of star formation and needing heavy
3346.88s: elements that were only formed after the
3349.68s: first wave of stars, um, you know, went
3352.56s: supernova and seeded the universe with
3354.56s: these heavier elements. Even taking that
3357.20s: into account, like I say, that there
3358.80s: could be civilizations out there that
3360.40s: got going a billion years before us. And
3362.72s: it it also, before I forget, it reminds
3364.72s: me of something John Mack once said and
3367.76s: talking about the the abduction
3369.76s: experiences. And he
3371.48s: said when when abductees say, "Oh, it's
3375.12s: it was like a medical procedure." He
3376.96s: said, "Yeah, the the word is it's like a
3380.08s: medical procedure. That's just our
3382.48s: anthropocentrism." He said it may be
3384.80s: something completely different. We we
3387.12s: kind of put it in a very human context
3390.64s: and we settle on the nearest match we
3394.00s: can find. So people say I was on a table
3396.32s: they they started doing stuff and we say
3398.08s: oh medical procedure you know
3400.16s: hybridization program samples but John
3402.80s: Mack said it might be something
3404.56s: completely different. Right. And that's
3406.72s: just impossible for us to even conceive.
3409.36s: Yeah. We can only use the words that we
3412.32s: have. Mhm. Which is, you know, why
3414.80s: people like Jacqu Valet, of course, look
3416.80s: at the folklore and and they say, "Well,
3418.88s: this is something that's always been
3420.40s: going on, but we've used different words
3422.16s: for it. Dwarves, fairies, elves, you
3425.28s: know, um, and
3428.20s: and flipping that around, there might
3431.36s: not only be things that we don't have
3432.96s: words for, but things that we don't have
3435.44s: the conceptual ability to even process.
3438.88s: I mean rather like you couldn't explain
3442.16s: quantum physics to a chimpanzee, right?
3445.12s: Maybe you can't explain the phenomenon
3447.52s: or some aspects of it to humans. That's
3450.64s: right. Yeah. And those are fun lines to
3452.72s: think of because that's really the
3454.08s: fringe of it all. That's like where you
3455.84s: get to the extremities of this
3457.36s: phenomenon and you kind of have to just
3459.88s: hypothesize, you know, anything you can
3462.64s: using this human interface. You know,
3464.24s: what are what are the limits of that?
3465.60s: you know, and even thinking so far as
3467.52s: like some of these
3469.16s: extraterrestrials possibly also observe
3472.04s: UAP to them, you know, like there and
3476.00s: and even thinking on the lines of, you
3478.80s: know, they might be a billion years more
3480.32s: advanced than us. If you look at the
3482.32s: trajectory, the absolute I mean just
3487.08s: shocking rise in propulsion technology
3491.20s: in in just tech in general in the last
3494.80s: several hundred years. How that line
3496.72s: goes straight up
3498.52s: exponentially. We might only be a
3500.40s: hundred years behind some of these
3501.88s: things. Yeah. I I remember one time,
3505.68s: slightly off topic, but it isn't.
3507.28s: talking to my grandparents and my
3509.12s: grandparents were telling me, "Oh yeah,
3511.28s: I saw one of the first German raids on
3514.88s: on the UK and I I sort of had in my mind
3518.80s: like, you know, images of bomber planes
3521.36s: and and my grandmother said, "No, no,
3523.60s: I'm talking about the Zeppelins and and
3526.48s: it just brings it home that like you
3529.28s: say, we've come from from horse and
3532.44s: buggy to stealth fighter and space probe
3535.68s: in in like a couple of hundred years and
3539.52s: you know you don't have to kind of go
3541.36s: too far beyond that when you look at the
3543.68s: exponential rise of technology
3545.68s: particularly with AI to say where are we
3548.16s: going to be in another well even even 10
3552.16s: 20 years but imagine 200 years
3555.40s: 500,000 a million yeah we don't we don't
3557.84s: even have to like speculate uh that far
3560.48s: you know ahead to to to really uh become
3564.16s: alien to our own selves like I mean
3566.08s: we're we're eventually going to look
3568.32s: back in the last, you know, 50 years and
3570.72s: go, "Wow, this is just we've we've
3573.12s: changed so much as a species." You know,
3575.12s: hope hopefully we get to that point.
3576.72s: Yeah. And and again, sort of related to
3580.48s: that, as much as we talk about an
3583.92s: ancient universe 14 billion years old,
3587.04s: civilizations a billion years ahead.
3589.92s: You can flip that and say in one sense
3592.56s: we are in the first heartbeats of the
3595.12s: universe because some of the stars are
3598.16s: going to last for trillions of years and
3601.76s: yet we're in the first 14 billion. So in
3604.32s: one sense statistically if you look at
3607.44s: it this way in the age of the universe
3610.00s: when we come to look at it it's it's
3611.84s: kind of bizarre that we we are at the
3613.76s: very beginning. Yeah very true. hard to
3616.88s: conceptualize all of these things
3618.40s: especially when you know our feeble
3620.40s: human minds can barely you know conceive
3622.48s: of time and and space. Back to some of
3626.88s: the cases uh that we were talking about.
3629.52s: Now we we touched on Rendlessham. I do I
3633.44s: do also want to ask a little bit more
3635.36s: about the binary code download when
3638.88s: interacting with this craft.
3642.80s: I mean, can you in a nutshell describe
3647.84s: how credible you think that was uh con
3651.44s: considering the evidence that was given
3653.12s: and the information that was taken from
3654.64s: it?
3655.92s: Well, I got to know Jim Penniston very
3658.00s: well and to me he he comes across as an
3663.20s: honest man and quite a humble man. And
3667.44s: and one of the most credible things
3669.52s: about this is that he sat on this aspect
3673.28s: of it for decades, probably about 30
3677.32s: years. Firstly, just out of
3679.44s: embarrassment and again I'll use the
3681.60s: phrase selfcensorship. It was okay to
3684.24s: say he'd seen a UFO because the the
3686.72s: colonel, the deputy base commander had
3688.32s: seen it, too. That's fine. But he
3690.32s: couldn't talk about a telepathic
3692.40s: download when he touched the side of
3694.08s: this thing. Not least because he stayed
3696.16s: in the service for years and he knew he
3699.04s: had a very high security clearance. uh
3701.28s: he was in the um PRP uh the personal
3705.76s: reliability program the handful of
3708.40s: people who have exceptionally high
3711.20s: security clearances go through all sorts
3713.68s: of extra vetting security clearances
3716.72s: psychological evaluation that sort of
3718.64s: thing. He knew that if he'd mentioned
3720.80s: telepathic download he he'd be out of
3722.88s: that and and then effectively he'd never
3725.60s: get any good postings again. he would
3728.64s: just be in in charge of the stores
3730.64s: depot.
3732.72s: Yeah, very true. Um, not not that
3735.44s: there's anything wrong with that. A lot
3736.96s: of people like that course do a very
3739.68s: good job. Yes, of course. But that was
3741.28s: not the job that the sort of job that he
3743.52s: wanted. Understood. Um, and what do you
3746.00s: make of the actual message itself? First
3749.20s: of all, this was given to him in these
3752.32s: zeros and ones that he jotted down. Um,
3755.76s: how did jotting those down to
3759.52s: deciphering those, how did how did that
3762.00s: end up happening? Well, he didn't even
3764.40s: know what binary code was. And maybe
3767.20s: that sounds surprising now, but I don't
3769.68s: think it was maybe that surprising back
3771.52s: in 1980. Maybe unless you were a
3773.68s: computer person, which not a lot of
3776.08s: people were, or a mathematician. That's
3777.76s: right. You know, you wouldn't. So he
3780.56s: just got this kind of what he described
3783.20s: as this compulsion. He touched the side
3786.64s: of the craft, felt a sort of jolt.
3789.52s: Something happened. Then two or three
3791.36s: days later under a compulsion he wrote
3794.48s: 16 pages of ones and zeros in a notebook
3797.60s: and then promptly kind of half forgot,
3800.72s: half self-censored for 30 years. And it
3805.28s: was only when somebody else and and by a
3807.68s: bizarre coincidence this somebody else
3809.44s: was Linda Molton
3811.00s: Hell. Jim was on a TV show and he was
3814.32s: due to talk about Randles and he was due
3818.88s: to show his police notebook where he had
3821.52s: made a sketch of the UFO and the symbols
3824.00s: on the side.
3825.88s: Linda happened to be walking behind him
3828.64s: before the interview as he was leafing
3830.48s: through this looked over his shoulder
3833.52s: and said, "Jim, what's that?" And Jim
3836.24s: was like, you know, really almost, you
3839.52s: know, nervous and and embarrassed. And
3841.76s: he was like, "Oh, nothing." And Linda
3843.60s: pushed the point. Linda, Linda can be
3846.08s: quite forceful, good investigator. and
3850.56s: and only then did did the story of this
3854.00s: binary code come out. And he didn't know
3855.84s: what it was. So the TV company got hold
3857.84s: of a they they somebody realized it was
3860.64s: binary. They got hold of a computer
3864.00s: engineer, a computer scientist called
3865.84s: Nick Cisk. Nick Cisk said, "Well, you
3869.36s: know, it's binary and obviously you can
3871.36s: just run it through a conversion
3873.12s: program." And out came this message um
3877.84s: exploration of
3879.48s: humanity continuous for planetary
3882.76s: advance. Eyes of your eyes origin year
3888.04s: 8,100. And then this sequence of
3891.20s: latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates
3894.16s: that happened to match
3897.20s: um a whole list of ancient and sacred
3900.88s: sites all around the world. everything
3902.56s: from the great pyramids at Giza to to
3904.88s: the Nazca lines in Peru.
3909.28s: That
3910.20s: is an incredible series of events when
3913.20s: you you know if if we take it on faith
3917.20s: that that is what happened that that is
3919.84s: how that information came about.
3923.20s: um you know which this there's there's
3925.76s: no real reason not to believe it but if
3929.20s: that is
3930.60s: true I
3932.44s: mean that there's just just a thousand
3935.76s: questions that's that spawn from this
3939.24s: like it's in his own mind in
3943.40s: binary it's not a message so he didn't
3946.08s: know what it was so first of all you're
3948.80s: unconsciously writing binary second of
3951.28s: all that binary translates into English.
3954.16s: Yeah, parts of it, right? You know, it's
3956.64s: it's like some of it is maybe junk, but
3959.84s: in there there's a message. And I I
3962.64s: suppose code breakers, cryptographers
3965.60s: will say that this is often the way that
3967.76s: classified information is is sent. You
3971.04s: have a whole lot of data, but there's
3974.00s: there is a message in there somewhere.
3976.48s: But that message was I mean I can't be
3978.88s: certain of this but almost deliberately
3980.72s: given to
3981.96s: him you know because that just kind of
3984.48s: doesn't line up with what the message is
3986.48s: and and and and the fact that that he
3989.28s: could read it because you know if this
3992.08s: was something that these
3992.88s: extraterrestrials didn't want him to
3994.64s: have then it wouldn't have been in I I
3998.56s: would assume it wouldn't have been in
4000.20s: English right unless they communicate in
4002.96s: English which which would also be
4004.96s: strange But yeah, I mean that's just
4007.20s: such a
4008.28s: bizarre, you know, encoding to receive.
4011.84s: You would almost think that, yeah, it
4013.12s: was deliberate that he was meant to get
4015.60s: this message. What do you make of that
4018.32s: message? What What does that What
4020.72s: general sort of gestalt do you take away
4023.20s: from that? It's difficult to get away
4026.16s: from the time travel aspect of this and
4030.24s: and you know, people say, "Well, is it
4032.80s: alien or is it time travel?" Mhm. The
4036.08s: two are not mutually exclusive. Again,
4038.96s: any civilization that's mastered
4041.44s: interstellar travel might also have
4043.36s: mastered time travel, but and that being
4047.92s: said, you know, origin year
4050.04s: 8,100. And then my attention was
4053.80s: drawn after long long after this
4056.92s: happened. My attention was drawn to the
4059.36s: the work of a a theoretical physicist
4061.76s: called Ronald Mallet.
4064.16s: And Ronald Mallet is one of the few
4067.12s: theoretical physicists doing research
4068.96s: into time travel.
4071.12s: And he subsequently
4074.28s: said, and I I don't believe he had heard
4077.52s: of Rendlessham and he had no particular
4079.44s: interest in UFOs, but he he just said,
4082.32s: "If you ever wanted to send a message
4084.24s: back through time, you would use uh a
4087.76s: subatomic particle stream, and you would
4091.20s: choose subatomic particles that had a
4093.76s: spin state of either up or down. and you
4097.04s: could then manipulate that and that
4099.92s: would enable you to send a binary
4102.40s: message back in time. And so, of course,
4105.68s: I had that light bulb moment in my head.
4108.08s: I'm like, wait, this is exactly what Jim
4111.20s: Penniston said.
4115.88s: Wow, that is
4118.60s: um you know also just writing down 16
4122.40s: pages of anything let alone a coherent
4126.56s: code I mean I can even if I could just
4129.28s: draw zeros without ones that's a lot of
4132.40s: effort
4133.92s: to to do sort of mundanely and and and
4137.28s: unconsciously like 16 pages is a lot
4141.52s: that's a lot of writing it is and and he
4144.24s: he looking back on it he he can't really
4147.76s: explain his state of mind at the time he
4151.20s: the nearest he got to it was it was it's
4155.04s: almost like he's under a compulsion of
4158.16s: almost a chance Yeah. Yeah. It's like he
4161.28s: was not himself.
4164.00s: Have you ever encountered any other uh
4167.28s: witnesses that described some type of
4169.20s: download during uh during your
4172.76s: investigations? Not quite like that, but
4175.76s: I have come
4178.04s: across abductees, people who've had
4182.24s: close encounters who believe that
4184.48s: they've had some sort of communication,
4186.88s: a telepathic download of a message. But
4189.68s: usually those messages are very cliched.
4192.32s: M I mean abductees get told things like
4195.44s: this won't hurt and and then it does.
4198.16s: It's almost like a you know like again
4200.88s: like John Mack like what a doctor tells
4203.36s: you just before he sticks the needle in.
4205.36s: Don't worry this won't hurt. Yeah. Um
4208.32s: but also very what I would call almost
4210.92s: cliched messages about the danger of of
4214.88s: pollution
4216.72s: um nuclear war. Although that that does
4219.60s: of course segue into to what we
4221.36s: discussed about the UFO nuclear
4223.52s: connection. But again, it's why would
4226.88s: these abductees get a message like that
4229.84s: when frankly I I don't mean this in a
4232.80s: disparaging way, but they are not
4235.20s: personally in any position to do
4237.12s: anything about that. It's it's not like
4239.28s: they're the president, you know, or the
4241.36s: prime minister or or or something. It's
4244.08s: it's just ordinary people. Yeah, I
4247.12s: completely agree with that sentiment.
4249.36s: It's something that's really stuck out
4250.80s: to me. Researching a lot of abduction
4253.36s: cases and even from the children in Rua
4255.84s: to, you know, uh, more modern cases,
4258.64s: even Chris Bledsoe, they were all sort
4261.52s: of given these messages of, oh, the
4263.92s: world, you know, you got to take care of
4265.52s: the world. We can't be destroying it.
4267.36s: All this stuff. And in in my head, I
4269.12s: always think, well, what good is that?
4271.84s: Well, like, why are you telling these
4273.60s: people? All you're doing is create is is
4276.72s: traumatizing people and then uh these
4279.36s: people just end up um you know uh at at
4282.16s: the very most in partaking in whatever
4285.36s: that is the very most like going to like
4287.20s: writing a book and going to UFO
4288.64s: conventions like there's no actual
4291.96s: change being made to you know completely
4297.60s: uh change the way we behave in in
4300.16s: regards to the environment or or war or
4302.48s: anything else. there's no significant
4304.24s: changes happening. They are aware of
4306.04s: that. You know, you would almost think
4308.00s: like, well, if you have the capacity to
4310.40s: zip around like this and do all these
4312.64s: things and implant these thoughts and
4314.16s: these messages, like just do it
4316.16s: yourself, you know, and um Exactly. And
4320.00s: which brings me back to this analogy of
4323.60s: the magician's trick. It's it's like
4326.32s: maybe that's just what they want you to
4328.56s: to think this is. It's like, oh yeah,
4331.36s: they're here for for giving us warnings,
4333.68s: but maybe what's actually going on is
4336.24s: something completely different. Maybe
4338.16s: it's a psychological evaluation of
4341.00s: humanity and and that they're giving
4343.68s: these messages to people, not because
4346.16s: those people are able to act on them,
4348.72s: but to see how they react to them. Might
4352.64s: also be some type of justification for
4354.56s: the procedures that they've been doing
4356.32s: as well. Like I mean if you say you know
4358.96s: ow that hurt and then they go yeah but
4360.64s: look at how bad you're you're treating
4362.48s: the world and you go oh and you feel sad
4364.24s: and then they go see you're the bad guy
4365.68s: not me and we kind of like accept that
4368.40s: exchange of like oh they did this for
4369.92s: the greater good. Um yes I mean I think
4373.20s: one of Jacqu Valet's books wasn't it was
4376.16s: you know messages of deception or or
4379.52s: whatever the title is but the idea of
4383.24s: deception runs I mean of course it's one
4386.96s: of these great
4388.20s: ironies UAP are often investigated by
4392.32s: people in military intelligence where
4394.68s: deception runs through as a theme and
4398.16s: the phenomenon itself demonstrates It's,
4401.44s: I would argue, a degree of deception.
4404.40s: Deception as to its true nature. You
4406.40s: know, maybe like John Max said, it looks
4408.72s: like a medical procedure, but it may be
4410.88s: something different. It sounds like
4412.64s: these people are being given warnings
4414.48s: about nuclear war and pollution, but
4416.72s: maybe it's something else. And and the
4418.64s: idea that there is deception at both
4421.12s: ends of the phenomenon, the phenomenon
4423.12s: itself, and then those who investigate
4424.64s: it and try and interpret it is is kind
4426.96s: of one of those cosmic ironies. And then
4430.16s: it brings you to the idea that that some
4432.96s: of this again I've mentioned how surreal
4436.96s: some of this is when you get past the
4439.96s: selfcensorship that that some of this is
4442.80s: almost like and then this is a phrase
4444.96s: that's been coined of course the cosmic
4447.16s: joker that the tr and every culture in
4450.32s: human history has had a trickster god.
4452.80s: What what comes to mind when you say
4454.24s: that uh something that you've
4456.00s: investigated when you say the cosmic
4457.68s: Joker? What's one thing that comes to
4459.04s: mind as you say that? Well, back to the
4461.20s: art shop and and that kind of thing.
4464.32s: Yeah. You you just it's like it's almost
4465.92s: ludicrous. It's it's like a Monty Python
4468.72s: sketch. Right.
4470.80s: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, truth is, in my
4474.32s: opinion, often, you know, stranger than
4475.96s: fiction a lot of
4478.76s: times. So fascinating, so bizarre, so
4481.84s: weird, you know, and and you said too,
4484.72s: they demonstrate things. So that that
4487.52s: itself is an act
4489.32s: of whatever that is like why are they
4492.08s: demonstrating these things they are
4494.08s: demonstrating them they they know very
4495.84s: well we have capabilities of picking
4497.28s: them up on radar or you know attracting
4499.92s: them through you know mental processes
4502.56s: i.e psionics or any of these things. So
4504.64s: what you know there's that question why
4507.12s: why show yourself is is is the big the
4509.84s: big question right sure we can do
4512.40s: stealth so absolutely any civilization
4516.00s: that's mastered interstellar travel you
4518.80s: know
4520.12s: self-evidently
4521.72s: wouldn't be seen unless they wanted to
4524.48s: be seen which brings me back to this
4526.96s: speculation if if you say they want to
4529.60s: be seen they want to interact with
4532.96s: people and have there is an agenda here.
4537.84s: What that agenda is, I don't know. Maybe
4540.72s: it's like I say a psychological
4543.00s: evaluation of certain individuals or of
4546.20s: humanity collectively, but maybe it's
4548.88s: something else that we don't like I
4551.20s: mentioned have the the conceptual
4553.28s: awareness. But they are showing this
4556.24s: they as you say they are
4558.20s: demonstrating something to us for a
4560.96s: reason. it it smacks of purpose and and
4564.80s: deliberateness. Yeah. Um it would be
4567.52s: hard for us to believe that it's just
4568.80s: straight up
4569.80s: negligence. Um but maybe that's also a
4572.52s: possibility. Maybe maybe they are making
4575.36s: you know they're they're fallible as
4576.96s: well. They might. But I'm drawn by
4579.44s: something that David Grush said
4581.52s: recently. And again, David Grush is
4583.44s: really, you know, when when people say,
4586.48s: well, oh, how many people did David
4589.68s: Grush talk to and why was he doing this?
4592.08s: He was doing this because Jay Stratton
4594.96s: told him to do this. I mean, Jay
4597.20s: Stratton, who headed up the UAP task
4599.04s: force, told David Grush, you go to the
4603.92s: all the different parts of the
4605.68s: intelligence community, all the
4607.20s: different parts of the military, go find
4609.20s: out who knows what. So when David Grush
4612.08s: came back and said, "I've talked to 40
4614.32s: people and all the rumors are true.
4616.24s: There really are intelligence community
4618.24s: legacy programs doing crash retrievalss
4620.80s: and reverse engineering." That was not
4623.68s: him pursuing some sort of hobby or that
4627.20s: that was him following a an order that
4630.00s: he'd been given by the head of the UAP
4631.92s: task force. And but my point is that he
4635.64s: said one aspect of this was that some of
4639.52s: this was almost like gifts from the gods
4642.80s: donations. Yeah. He said some of these
4644.96s: things had not crashed. They had been
4646.80s: left for us. Yeah. Yeah. That's a that's
4651.28s: a really hard one to grasp as well
4653.76s: because you know if if if it if it is
4657.20s: future humans you know then then that
4660.08s: almost doesn't make sense that well
4661.76s: unless there's you know some type of
4664.40s: time manipulation and and you know but
4666.88s: then they want to give us this
4669.04s: technology so that we will figure it out
4671.20s: and build it and once we've built it
4674.00s: then we need to go back and put it you
4678.00s: know or messages about it to Rendlessham
4680.96s: Forest in in 1980. There's a great Isaac
4683.72s: Azimov story I think the end of eternity
4686.72s: which deals with this kind of nature
4689.12s: that that yeah the people going back and
4693.52s: you know have to to kind of go back in
4696.96s: time and give the mathematical equations
4700.64s: which will lead to the development of
4702.80s: time travel so that it can be done in
4705.12s: the first place and round and round it
4706.80s: goes. Yeah. too much for my meager brain
4710.48s: to to conceptualize. Mine too. But I I
4713.68s: can I can kind of say the words, but
4716.52s: yeah, the whether it really
4721.28s: I don't know permeates. I don't know.
4723.68s: Yeah. Yeah. Chicken or egg. You know
4725.44s: what came first? Well, in the UFO in the
4728.32s: UFOcape, it would definitely be egg.
4731.32s: Um, this brings me to another famous
4733.84s: case that I'd like to talk about is the
4736.20s: Calvine case.
4738.40s: Now, recently in um James Fox's
4742.00s: documentary, The Program, uh you were
4744.48s: featured as a key figure um when
4747.12s: discussing the Calvine UFO case because
4750.16s: during your time there
4752.72s: um you had come across these photos,
4756.24s: these famous photos of what seemed like
4758.88s: this giant diamond- shaped craft being
4763.44s: um intercepted or observed by a fighter
4766.96s: jet.
4767.84s: um from uh from the Air
4772.84s: Force
4774.60s: when who was it? It was uh Craig Lindsay
4778.32s: was the Craig Lindsay. He was the uh
4781.12s: Royal Air Force the press officer press
4783.12s: officer who recently came forward with
4785.84s: an image that he said is one of the
4788.40s: originals. Now I can't comment on
4790.80s: whether it is or not simply because the
4793.04s: Ministry of Defense hasn't commented on
4796.48s: that. So when I talk about these cases I
4798.88s: can only talk about them because the
4800.16s: Ministry of Defense has
4801.64s: themselves declassified and released
4804.48s: some of the information because they
4806.40s: haven't commented on the authenticity of
4808.56s: Craig Lindsay's picture. You can't I
4811.20s: can't comment on I can't confirm or deny
4814.48s: but absolutely we had six images and the
4817.92s: associated
4819.08s: negatives. I we we had one of them the
4822.64s: best one blown up to a sort of poster
4825.52s: size and we had it literally on our
4827.44s: office wall. So a few years back
4832.28s: I when they declassified the file there
4835.92s: was a photocopy of a line drawing in
4839.28s: there. So from that and just from my
4842.40s: memory because this was on my office
4843.92s: wall for years. I did a with a a graphic
4847.20s: artist from Los Angeles. We did a CGI
4850.92s: recreation and it's pretty similar to
4854.56s: the Craig
4855.88s: Lindsay photo. So people can can make of
4860.00s: that what they will. But yeah,
4861.44s: absolutely. These pictures were real
4865.24s: daylight footage of this huge diamond
4868.32s: shaped craft that the witness the two
4871.20s: witnesses said just hung there in the
4873.28s: sky and then accelerated off at high
4875.84s: speed but this time straight up. Um we
4880.00s: looked at it in the Ministry of Defense
4882.08s: obviously we had access to uh JRIC which
4885.92s: was the joint air um reconnaissance and
4888.88s: intelligence center. So again, imagery
4892.68s: analysis, intelligence community imagery
4895.68s: analysis folks, they looked at at all
4899.28s: this and they said, "Yeah, it's it's
4900.72s: real. It's whatever it is. It's like 75
4904.24s: ft across. It's it's, you know, it's a
4907.60s: solid structured craft, but we have no
4909.52s: idea what it is." And that um because
4911.84s: there are people online that say, "Oh,
4913.60s: it it's it's like it's the mountain in
4915.60s: the background or it's some type of
4917.12s: water reflection or anything like that."
4919.20s: You're saying that this is definitely a
4920.96s: solid craft, that this is what it
4922.64s: perceives to be. Correct. And and
4925.28s: firstly, of course, the people that are
4926.88s: saying that, they're working off the
4930.16s: Craig Lindsay image. Like I say, I'm I'm
4932.48s: not commenting on that, but we had six
4936.64s: images. And this was an official
4939.60s: intelligence community analysis. Yeah.
4942.80s: This was not a fake. This was not some
4944.80s: sort of optical illusion. So yeah, I've
4947.44s: I've seen all sorts of speculation
4949.92s: online like it's it's a a mountain peak
4952.88s: wreathed in clouds. It's it's like a
4955.60s: reflection of a rock in a pond. It's a
4957.52s: Christmas ornament, you know, yada yada
4961.12s: yada. No, that that was not that was not
4964.80s: the assessment of of the British
4967.28s: intelligence community. On a scale of 1
4970.96s: to 10, 10
4973.64s: being, you know, the clearest image of a
4977.28s: UFO that you've ever seen during your
4980.24s: time there, where does this Calvine
4983.76s: photo sit? Oh, it's a 10. It's a 10.
4986.96s: It's a 10. Yeah. There's You've not come
4989.04s: across anything else that is as striking
4992.40s: as this one. Is that because the
4994.24s: multiple images?
4996.40s: That's part of it. Yes. um multiple
4998.88s: images also daylight images because the
5001.68s: the key point about that is so many
5003.52s: pictures of UFOs are taken at night and
5006.96s: you don't have any other features in but
5009.52s: where you've got a daylight picture with
5011.76s: with like the ground a distant forest
5014.48s: foreground as well. Yeah. You can
5016.24s: triangulate. Yeah. And once you can
5017.92s: triangulate, you can start to to make
5019.84s: some calculations about the distance of
5021.84s: the object from the lens, the height of
5023.92s: the object, the diameter of the object,
5026.16s: that that sort of thing. And the size
5027.68s: compared to another craft as well. I
5029.28s: think it's an important piece of
5030.32s: information. Yes.
5033.80s: Um, you think that pilot will ever be
5036.16s: located? Uh, I'm not going to comment on
5039.12s: that. Okay. Sorry. Again, you know, I
5041.92s: have to be very careful. Of course, the
5044.00s: official secrets act in the UK is
5046.88s: binding for life. I see. And when I talk
5050.16s: about this, I can only talk about cases
5052.64s: that are either unclassified or that the
5054.96s: Ministry of Defense has declassified.
5057.76s: So, I can't Yeah. I can't preempt them
5060.64s: and there are some some So, I'm I'm not
5063.52s: really able to comment on the pilot.
5065.44s: Sure. then I I I appreciate the answer
5069.12s: uh regardless and I apologize for asking
5071.60s: but it's it is my duty to ask these
5073.76s: questions. It's it's absolutely I I
5076.16s: understand and respect that and yeah
5081.32s: um let's see
5083.88s: here. Well, I mean I have more more
5086.64s: questions about the Calvine, but I think
5087.92s: we'll we'll move past that. I want to
5090.16s: get
5090.92s: into now your work. Well, be actually
5094.00s: before we get into um Ancient Aliens and
5096.48s: and your work with the History Channel,
5098.00s: what you're currently doing and and the
5099.68s: projects that you're working on now, um
5102.16s: I did want to ask uh one last thing. Did
5106.80s: you ever
5108.20s: encounter or hear of stories from the
5111.68s: people that you've uh visited of them
5115.12s: being visited prior to your
5118.12s: visitation? It it did come up. Yes. I
5122.24s: guess you would call this men in black
5124.88s: kind of cases. From time to time it
5127.36s: would be, well, why are you asking me
5128.72s: all this? I've I've already told those
5131.64s: guys like, wait, what guys? And I didn't
5136.88s: have a lot of that, but it did happen
5139.76s: from time to time. And and the other
5142.48s: thing is it wasn't necessarily on the
5146.16s: cases that you would think would be the
5147.84s: significant ones. Sometimes it would be
5150.00s: on a really what you would think was a
5152.64s: really low data case like just just a
5156.72s: sort of casual light in the sky thing. H
5160.08s: and then then you get this story about
5162.48s: men in black and it's like well you
5164.72s: would think if if you were going to get
5167.52s: that you would get it with the flagship
5169.68s: crown jewel cases Randles Calvine. Well,
5172.80s: of course they do say that it happened
5175.20s: in Calvin, but that's another story. But
5177.84s: but to find it happening just, you know,
5181.68s: John Smith out walking his dog on a wet
5184.32s: Tuesday evening seeing a momentary light
5187.68s: in the sky. A case that you would think
5190.96s: nothing of. You you couldn't even
5193.00s: investigate, you know, over and above
5196.40s: saying, well, is it on a flight path?
5199.36s: Was there a meteor shower that night? um
5203.12s: was there any satellite that might have
5205.52s: been that sort of thing, but a really
5208.48s: low data case and then suddenly you
5210.88s: would have and these two guys turned up
5213.28s: um interviewed me at great length, told
5215.84s: me it would probably be in my interests
5217.44s: not to discuss this. Wow. And you would
5219.60s: think why on a case like that
5222.76s: when it almost draws your attention to
5227.12s: it and then you think but maybe that's
5230.80s: the point.
5233.12s: Were the descriptions of these men ever
5236.56s: bizarre?
5239.28s: It it was almost always just, you know,
5242.32s: government people in dark suits. I see.
5244.80s: Yeah. never like bald with big eyes or
5247.36s: not not like that overly tall or uh
5250.16s: nothing like that. I've heard of those
5252.48s: sorts of cases mainly in the US, but it
5255.28s: was generally just well these people
5257.52s: looked like they were government or air
5258.88s: force in in in civilian clothes and um
5262.88s: American accents.
5264.88s: No, British. British in in in the UK
5268.72s: British. So I mean immediately as
5271.04s: someone who is working at the secret
5273.76s: levels of the government I mean that
5275.44s: must raise a red flag for you. You must
5276.96s: be thinking well who else is working on
5279.20s: the same things that I'm working on and
5281.20s: how did they come about this information
5283.04s: prior to me receiving it like that. Did
5285.36s: you ever look into that? Yes. And and
5288.80s: again, we worked with I mean, you asked
5291.52s: me earlier, could could there be another
5295.00s: unit doing this on a a clandestine
5298.24s: basis? And my my answer is I struggled
5300.32s: to see how they would get the data
5302.56s: because I mean, you we were the ones who
5304.88s: had literally a UFO hotline for for like
5308.24s: I say the the 85 90 plus% cases that
5312.88s: came from the public. how you know I
5315.92s: guess someone could bug the line that's
5318.08s: easy to do but but sometimes you meet
5320.32s: people face to face you hear things you
5323.36s: you
5323.96s: you have face tof face conversations
5326.40s: with air force people and we it's not
5328.88s: like we didn't do this ourselves I mean
5330.80s: we did of course we did like for example
5334.92s: covertly attend UFO conferences for
5338.88s: example um I mean yeah I've done that
5341.84s: there's even there's Even there's a
5345.80s: declassified paper in a Ministry of
5348.00s: Defense file somewhere at the National
5349.76s: Archives with me saying to to one of my
5353.68s: opposite numbers in defense intelligence
5356.00s: something like I just come back from the
5358.24s: conference uh lots of chatter about X
5361.84s: and Y you know that that sort of thing
5364.96s: and they did the same themselves. It was
5366.88s: just who who can go to the conference.
5369.52s: They're having the big conference this
5371.20s: weekend. Who and and it was literally
5373.44s: well is who's free? Um who who's it
5378.56s: closer to geographically? And one time I
5381.36s: went along and I I took a you know you
5384.08s: always like I I took I took someone I I
5387.12s: took it. probably totally illegal, but I
5391.04s: took like a civilian friend of mine, not
5393.60s: even in the Ministry of Defense, uh,
5395.84s: female who who I just thought, well,
5398.64s: it's it's good. You're much more likely
5400.96s: to get busted if you're a like a single
5403.28s: male, um, but go as a couple and no
5406.88s: one's going to question you. So, we did
5409.76s: that. Interesting. So, there almost
5412.64s: certainly is. So, we were the men in
5414.96s: black, right? She was the woman in black
5417.28s: and and one time she actually I did this
5421.12s: with two different people. One one of
5423.52s: the women definitely lent into this and
5428.32s: would literally attend dressed all in
5430.96s: black with huge black sunglasses. Oh no.
5435.04s: Not Yeah. Not exactly covert. No. But
5437.28s: then it became a double blah, right?
5439.36s: Because it's like well she's so
5441.36s: obviously like men in black. Yeah. a we
5444.64s: a woman in black that it couldn't be be
5448.48s: her that's covertly here and of course
5451.20s: it was I mean it obviously makes sense
5453.28s: that uh governments are attending each
5456.48s: and every one of these because even if
5458.40s: there's a 1% chance that there might be
5461.28s: sensitive information being shared they
5463.20s: have to be aware of it right so it does
5465.52s: make absolute sense that they would be
5467.68s: going to these things now as someone who
5471.68s: was going to these things in a sort
5473.44s: aloof manner. Um, what were some
5476.64s: protocols that you would adhere to in
5479.52s: order to not blow your cover? Well,
5481.60s: don't get caught, right? But what does
5483.36s: that mean? Don't engage in conversation
5485.44s: or does that mean engage in conversation
5487.36s: but don't talk about what you do or um
5490.56s: definitely the latter. Yeah. Yeah. Don't
5492.48s: get drunk at the bar and tell them that
5494.16s: you're secretly working for the
5495.60s: government, though. That would really
5497.12s: would be a double bluff, I suppose, or
5499.52s: triple bluff or something like that. But
5501.44s: no. Yeah. just just be natural. Don't
5504.48s: draw attention to yourself. Um and don't
5507.52s: get caught. Do you ever um cuz you've
5509.68s: attended a lot of these UFO conventions
5512.00s: and namely we didn't even mention this
5513.44s: and I'm probably going to put this at
5514.88s: the top of the uh video, but uh this
5517.52s: interaction happened because of contact
5520.16s: in the desert. And so I'd just like to
5521.92s: give them a quick little shout out here.
5524.08s: Uh they put us in touch uh which allowed
5526.40s: you to come here and we will both be
5528.24s: present at contact in the desert. Uh so
5530.96s: thank you uh for hooking that up. I just
5533.60s: wanted to throw that at the top before
5535.76s: anything else. Yes, and and absolutely
5539.28s: um I will be speaking at contact in the
5541.12s: desert of course interacting with folks
5544.08s: and I could be virtually 100% sure there
5548.24s: will be folks from the government there
5550.96s: covertly. I I mean I even talked to
5553.12s: someone recently who who told me that a
5557.12s: particular intelligence officer had been
5559.44s: told in in association with with what
5562.56s: the US government was doing, you know,
5565.20s: we need to find out what's going on. And
5567.44s: part of that is find out who knows what.
5570.40s: And the only way that this intelligence
5574.00s: officer could really do that fully was
5576.48s: to go to some of the conferences.
5580.88s: That's so interesting. It Do you ever
5583.28s: have because you've been to so many of
5585.04s: these
5586.76s: conventions, have you ever suspected
5588.96s: anyone else of playing that role? Yes.
5592.72s: It It's like
5595.16s: any particular group of
5597.96s: people, the language they use, the body
5600.88s: language. Like for example, if if if you
5604.24s: were an undercover cop or if you were a
5607.12s: cop but just not in uniform, you could
5609.44s: probably go into a crowded bar and spot
5613.04s: the other cops, particularly if you
5614.80s: start talking to them. There's a certain
5617.52s: bearing. There's there's language.
5620.48s: There's there's the look. And you find
5623.60s: it in almost every niche of society that
5628.16s: that you know you I mean you you have
5630.16s: the same for example with gay people,
5632.40s: you know, who would be able to spot each
5634.64s: other or cops or military or what
5637.36s: whatever it is, whether it's magicians.
5639.92s: Magicians, you you can probably maybe
5642.80s: spot them. Definitely. I don't know.
5644.64s: Yeah. if they're if they're wearing a
5645.76s: fedora, right? And so, yeah, I often go
5651.60s: to these things like contact in the
5653.12s: desert and see people and and I'm I'm
5656.32s: like, yeah, but I'm too much of a kind
5661.44s: of nice guy to out anyone to draw it to.
5665.60s: Yeah. To draw attention to it because
5667.04s: they've got a difficult enough job as it
5668.80s: is and they're there to gather data. I
5671.44s: don't want to kind of give them that
5672.64s: extra headache. Plus, it's like it's
5675.04s: well the the magicians club. It's like
5678.24s: the government club. You you wouldn't
5680.24s: want to bust someone or I would. Sure.
5681.92s: Yeah. No, I I I I definitely That's a
5684.64s: great uh analogy. Um but I will I will
5689.04s: be coming to see you at Contact of the
5690.40s: Desert for an update. By the way, maybe
5692.56s: on the last day I'm going to go find
5693.84s: Nick and I'm like, "Nick, break it down.
5696.00s: Who's a spook?
5697.84s: So, off the record, you might have to
5699.68s: confirm or deny some things to me uh
5702.00s: regarding uh potential spies among us.
5706.92s: Um, okay. Let's discuss a little bit
5710.40s: about your transition, which is kind of
5714.80s: a wild, it almost seems like, you know,
5718.40s: because you start at Ministry of
5719.76s: Defense, nothing to do with UFOs,
5721.60s: nothing to do with UAPs, just like uh
5723.84s: really important uh work that you were
5725.92s: doing there. um you know, count what
5728.24s: counterterrorism or like all these
5730.00s: really important things to going into
5732.24s: the X-Files essentially getting so
5736.16s: enamored by the subject matter and
5738.48s: convinced yourself that this is
5740.80s: happening, that there is something to
5742.16s: this phenomenon that you started
5744.72s: pursuing it on your own. which
5747.04s: eventually led you into the second half
5749.60s: of your professional career which is
5753.20s: becoming sort of this outspoken
5755.20s: figurehead for transparency for
5758.00s: Euphology and namely uh eventually led
5760.96s: you to you know working with the History
5762.88s: Channel. So can you give me a little bit
5764.32s: of a timeline on how that looked like
5766.40s: and how that came to be? Sure. And
5769.84s: absolutely I personally the way I
5772.80s: describe this is that I came out of the
5774.56s: shadows and into the spotlight. M and it
5777.68s: was a real 180 flip because when you're
5783.52s: in the Ministry of
5784.92s: Defense, you can just about tell people
5788.24s: that you're in the MOD, but you know, in
5791.52s: conversations with people not there, you
5793.92s: you just have to be very general and
5796.64s: say, "Oh, it's it's just an admin job,
5798.96s: nothing exciting, things like that." M
5801.52s: uh you can never get into the details of
5803.44s: course so much of it is classified
5805.68s: particularly on things like
5807.80s: counterterrorism and you know which I
5810.72s: have been fortunate enough to be
5813.44s: involved with in one of my my mod
5816.08s: postings. So yeah, you
5818.92s: you have this kind
5821.24s: of contrast that for 21 years I was this
5827.12s: smartly dressed civil servant who
5830.16s: couldn't really discuss anything about
5832.40s: their work and then I felt when I was
5834.56s: exposed to this UAP information I felt
5837.84s: that it was too interesting and
5839.16s: important to walk away from and I felt
5843.24s: that the ministry corporately was not
5847.28s: really gripping this and I knew that
5850.32s: that there was more that should be done
5852.56s: and and so I I stayed involved even
5856.08s: while I was in the Ministry of Defense
5858.00s: and somebody else had that job. I stayed
5861.08s: involved. The Ministry of Defense then
5863.76s: under open government initiative started
5866.32s: declassifying and releasing some
5868.16s: information and that even though my
5871.12s: non-disclosure agreement the official
5873.44s: secrets act applies enabled me to to
5877.04s: speak about this. Mhm. And I wrote some
5879.72s: books
5881.88s: and I did some TV you know mainly news.
5887.76s: So for example the BBC Mhm. if they
5890.76s: wanted somebody to talk about this
5892.96s: subject, they would come to me. You were
5894.64s: the UA the UFO correspondent
5897.04s: essentially. Yes. I I And ironically, I
5900.16s: actually did some some of the first
5902.24s: interviews I did, of course, was between
5905.20s: 91 and 94 when I was doing that job. I
5907.92s: was put up as spokesperson, but once
5910.32s: you're on a BBC list, you know, you
5912.64s: never really get off it. and and with
5915.92s: the agreement of the press office, they
5918.00s: were happy for me to carry on doing that
5921.76s: as long as I did them the occasional
5923.44s: favor. Um I see. I see. Very
5927.84s: interesting. But um so I I carried on
5931.36s: and then I took early retirement in 2006
5935.12s: because I felt that I was doing two
5936.56s: jobs. M and since
5940.20s: then I I obviously when I stopped doing
5943.44s: government work it freed up a whole lot
5945.92s: of time and I was able to ramp up what I
5948.64s: did privately and then it it just so
5953.76s: happened because that's my life journey
5955.92s: that I got married and Elizabeth is a US
5959.20s: citizen so I moved to the US in January
5962.76s: 2012 that put me right in the center of
5967.12s: of the crosshairs when it came to folks
5970.56s: like A&D, History Channel, um doing
5974.00s: shows like Ancient Aliens and suddenly
5975.92s: thinking, well, hey, we've got this
5977.52s: government guy who's done this not as a
5980.32s: hobby but as a job. We should get him on
5983.04s: the show. Yeah, that's an incredible
5985.28s: thing to have on your resume as someone
5987.28s: uh you know, in and around Eupfology.
5988.88s: we're often, you know, our own
5991.60s: researchers and we're, you know, uh, we
5994.32s: don't readily have access other than
5997.04s: foyer requests to a lot of these
5999.52s: official cases. So, it does make for an
6002.24s: interesting, um, uh, I mean, it does it
6006.16s: does make it very interesting when
6007.28s: someone comes into this space having
6009.60s: prior knowledge to how these things
6013.12s: function within, you know, the confines
6014.88s: of the government. So I I I agree like
6017.36s: for me even sitting across from you now
6019.28s: is uh you know a treat because someone
6022.16s: who's interested in this stuff I mean uh
6023.84s: you you were the type of person I would
6025.52s: like to ask uh the most questions to. So
6027.68s: I I can see how that was very fitting.
6030.24s: Was there ever
6032.20s: a I mean obviously there probably was,
6034.64s: but what was there ever like a conflict
6037.76s: of interest there going from like did
6040.00s: you ever get a call from mod being like
6041.68s: hey Nick what are you doing? No, but
6045.04s: only because I knew where the line was.
6047.04s: And I mentioned earlier that I did them
6049.92s: the occasional favor. Um, and I knew
6054.24s: what lines they wanted to push in
6057.20s: relation to this and they was happy to
6058.96s: do that. One interesting thing, one
6060.96s: interesting indication of this
6063.40s: happened well a few years ago with the
6065.92s: whole let's storm Area 51 thing and I
6070.88s: did an interview on Fox News and I said
6073.68s: let's not storm Area 51. This is a
6076.80s: really bad idea for a whole bunch of
6078.32s: reasons. And and subsequently, I got an
6081.96s: email from my old boss at the MOD who I
6087.28s: thought had long since retired. Turned
6089.68s: out he was still at the MOD after 43
6092.72s: years on or something. And he said, "Saw
6095.04s: your interview, Nick. You know, good
6097.12s: good line." And and so it just
6100.08s: reinforced the fact that they're always
6102.72s: watching. Whoa.
6106.16s: So, no, I haven't had conflicts because
6109.36s: I know where the line is and I don't
6112.00s: cross it and and because of these sort
6114.88s: of favors. What What is one of these
6117.28s: favors would you say that you're
6118.96s: comfortable talking about? What's
6120.16s: something that they would ask you to do
6121.28s: or say or not say?
6123.52s: I think one of the favors is is to
6126.56s: promote the line
6130.12s: that we believe in open government on
6132.88s: this and and that you know information
6136.32s: is being released and that isn't
6138.56s: necessarily the case, is it? It's not
6141.12s: always the case. All right. Okay. Fair
6143.20s: enough. But that's what they want us to
6144.72s: believe. Yes. It's what you would call
6146.88s: in in public affairs language you would
6150.16s: say it's a key message that they want to
6152.52s: promote always promote open government
6155.60s: you know we we are we are quite open
6157.76s: with this even if we're not right and
6159.60s: that uh definitely
6162.20s: counteracts what is kind of happening
6165.36s: right now with the US government because
6167.36s: of the uh because the government the
6170.24s: general consensus of the population
6172.48s: believes that the government is
6173.76s: withholding sensitive information that
6176.00s: could pertain to their welfare
6177.80s: well-being. Um that is why you know that
6181.84s: is why the current administration was so
6183.60s: favorably you know uh put into office
6186.00s: and that is also why this UAP and uh
6188.80s: sort of not just the UAP sorry but the
6191.12s: whole declassification task force has
6193.68s: now being put forward because of this
6196.16s: lack of transparency.
6199.20s: So yes, it is in a government's interest
6201.28s: to at least promote the idea that they
6203.20s: are being transparent, even if that
6204.80s: isn't the case, to avoid things like
6206.80s: we're seeing now. Yes. And on the very
6210.16s: first day of President Trump's second
6212.48s: term, he signed an executive order that
6215.12s: that related to the declassification of
6218.00s: information about the assassinations of
6220.60s: JFK, RFK, and MLK. Yeah. and and
6227.16s: the this is kind of a little complex in
6230.96s: legislative terms, but the the newly
6234.08s: formed task force on the
6236.08s: declassification of federal secrets,
6238.24s: which has been headed up by
6239.76s: Representative Anna Paulina Luna, is
6243.68s: associated with that executive order. It
6246.80s: derives some of its authority from that.
6251.12s: um but it's not specifically mentioned
6254.24s: in it, but the letters that this task
6258.32s: force sent out to the various government
6260.36s: agencies site the original executive
6264.08s: order. So you could say that this is
6266.16s: really a a top-down initiative and those
6271.20s: letters specifically mentioned UAP as
6275.68s: being part of the business of this task
6278.16s: force. They're going to do JFK first. Um
6281.60s: they're going to do some other things,
6283.12s: but UAP is definitely on the list. Mhm.
6287.60s: And of course that we in parallel with
6290.44s: that, we know that of course there is
6294.08s: information that the government isn't
6296.64s: telling on this. One of the reasons we
6298.72s: know it is because that there are public
6300.24s: hearings, but there are also classified
6302.00s: briefings. And sometimes journalists
6305.16s: will button hole someone as they come
6307.52s: out of one of these and stick a
6308.96s: microphone in their face and say, "Hey,
6310.88s: what just happened?" And they'll say,
6312.16s: "Well, it's very interesting, but it's
6314.16s: classified, so I can't tell you."
6316.60s: Occasionally people's language and
6319.28s: sometimes body
6320.84s: language kind of makes you wonder. I
6324.04s: think one congressional
6327.24s: representative said, "Yeah, I've just
6329.44s: been had the classified briefing. lock
6332.56s: your
6333.56s: doors and you get these these kind of
6337.44s: and another said um I can't discuss what
6341.84s: happened in the classified briefing
6343.68s: because it's classified but if you were
6347.60s: to ask me whether or not I think we're
6351.52s: alone in the universe then my answer
6353.76s: would be that I'm not and of course that
6356.80s: question had not been asked though it
6358.96s: was perhaps implicit and We know that of
6363.04s: course
6363.80s: the UAP task force now um of course it's
6369.32s: AROW the all domain anomaly resolution
6372.76s: office
6374.52s: had at least one meeting maybe more now
6378.64s: um they they testified under oath that
6382.32s: they had held that they had set up a
6384.56s: five eyes UAP caucus or working group.
6389.12s: So, we know that not only is the United
6393.12s: States involved, but Canada is involved,
6396.16s: the United Kingdom is involved,
6398.48s: Australia is involved, and New Zealand
6401.28s: are involved. But I think all of the
6404.72s: five eyes nations have confirmed that
6408.16s: they sent people to this
6410.28s: UAP working group um meeting in the
6414.32s: Pentagon. I think the first one was held
6416.00s: May May 23.
6418.48s: if if I remember correctly. But of
6420.96s: course, the details of what was actually
6423.36s: discussed have not been made public.
6425.52s: Yeah. I mean, those are all interesting
6427.12s: things. Again, it's cuz like you have
6428.48s: this like public facing issue with this
6431.92s: stuff as well. And as you mentioned, you
6433.76s: know, like these favors of of, you know,
6436.16s: seemingly making it seem like they're
6438.64s: transparent. I mean, when we hear about
6442.04s: these task forces or these congressional
6445.40s: hearings, you know, I think a lot of
6447.80s: people, especially people who have been
6450.16s: in this subject matter a little longer,
6452.80s: kind of see through a lot of that
6455.84s: because because it's public facing, uh,
6458.88s: because there are DOPs requests and, you
6461.44s: know, there is somebody telling these
6463.28s: people what not to say and it seems like
6467.80s: that is not something that we're so
6471.52s: easily going to have access to and that
6474.24s: probably you know ends up being the
6476.16s: frustration of a lot of people.
6478.68s: Um, do you think this task force, this
6481.60s: current task force is more of a
6486.24s: front-facing sort of public uh demon
6489.72s: demonstrative organization or do you
6492.32s: think that they are actually going to go
6495.68s: deep and find what it is that we're
6497.92s: looking for? I don't know. It it could
6501.52s: be either because I don't I don't have
6504.64s: access to the president on this and it
6506.96s: it literally would be a presidential
6510.08s: issue. Now, President Trump has has said
6514.32s: and has hinted that he knows some
6516.88s: interesting things about this. And of
6520.16s: course, if he has truly empowered this
6524.72s: task force and and said that this must
6528.00s: be a vehicle to disclose all
6530.56s: information, then it it will happen
6533.44s: because that will be a lawful top- down
6536.08s: order from the commander-in-chief.
6538.64s: But if if it's just window dressing
6541.76s: again, it it will kind of look the same.
6544.24s: It'll look the same. It will look the
6545.60s: same until and unless it actually
6548.32s: delivers a smoking gun. All right. Yeah.
6550.88s: It's hard to tell, isn't it? Yeah. All
6553.44s: right, Nick, I'm going to start the
6554.72s: other camera. We have some questions
6556.24s: here from our um our our members
6560.40s: basically. So, they join a membership on
6562.16s: YouTube or on Patreon. We call them
6564.00s: interns. So, there are interns here. um
6566.32s: are allowed to ask the guest a few
6568.08s: questions and I cherrypick these
6569.60s: questions. So, I'm going to go turn the
6571.12s: camera on and then we're going to get to
6572.72s: those questions if that's all right with
6573.92s: you. Certainly.
6578.88s: And they don't pull any punches. All
6580.32s: right. So, feel free to answer in any
6582.96s: way that you would like. Uh here is the
6586.80s: first one by Fire Mist.
6589.86s: [Music]
6593.04s: It's fun, right? Yeah. Uh, what is the
6596.16s: most ridiculous explanation you've had
6598.32s: to give to the public about something
6600.00s: mysterious or unknown?
6602.88s: I'm not sure it's ridiculous, but just
6605.44s: the I
6607.00s: guess the sound
6610.04s: bite, it's of no defense significance.
6613.44s: That's in one sense the most ridiculous.
6615.76s: And this was a standard sound bite. And
6618.08s: of course it was fine when you were
6620.08s: talking about a case that was either
6623.12s: explained or low data, but of course
6625.28s: it's ridiculous when you have to trot it
6627.92s: out in relation to something like
6629.76s: Randles or Calvin or or the Kosford
6632.80s: incident that we talked about. So So the
6635.52s: most ridiculous thing is to say that
6638.56s: something is of no defense significance
6641.32s: when you have a pilot chasing something
6644.40s: that he can't catch. Uh, of course it's
6647.44s: of defense significance. Or military
6649.68s: personnel being zapped by radiation and
6652.16s: downloads. Yeah, absolutely. So, so, oh,
6655.12s: don't worry, it's of no defense
6656.80s: significance. And, and I guess a
6659.92s: followup is like if someone was to come
6662.40s: back and say, well, what does that
6664.00s: actually mean? The answer is whatever we
6666.88s: want it to mean.
6670.20s: Yeah. Do you ever have a list of these
6672.64s: things that you were told to say? like
6674.16s: are are these things that you've come up
6675.60s: with yourself or was this like a general
6677.28s: memo like this is what you say in these
6679.68s: times? We we literally had I think I
6684.00s: mentioned say public affairs folks would
6686.48s: have what's called key messages. We we
6689.04s: had various key messages which I
6692.28s: inherited uh from my predecessor and he
6695.44s: inherited from his and they go some of
6697.36s: them go back to the second world war.
6699.04s: Are those classified? No, I don't think
6701.60s: so. They've some sometimes they've
6703.68s: actually even been released, but it's a
6705.68s: it's a classic case of the best place to
6707.68s: hide a book is in a library. I see.
6710.24s: these key messages like you know stress
6713.44s: this um say that and first of all you
6717.36s: have key messages which I think like the
6720.40s: UFO phenomenon is of no defense
6723.04s: significance or the current favorite is
6726.16s: something like in over 50 years of
6728.08s: looking at this phenomenon we have yet
6730.56s: to encounter a case with direct evidence
6733.04s: of a an overt threat to the United
6736.48s: Kingdom or or something like that and
6739.04s: then So those are your key messages and
6741.36s: then occasionally they they release what
6744.56s: are called or were called in my days
6747.44s: defensive lines to take and then you
6750.80s: would have brackets if pressed and these
6753.84s: were things that you were not to
6755.80s: volunteer but if a particularly
6759.24s: tenacious journalist were to ask them it
6763.52s: was okay to to say these. So you you
6766.16s: start with the key messages and you work
6767.92s: your way down. And wow. Yeah, some of
6770.80s: those have been released. How many tiers
6772.88s: down does it go?
6775.04s: You know, nothing is truly effective if
6778.48s: you can't say it on one sheet of paper.
6781.04s: So most of these bullet points you can
6783.04s: fit on to one sheet. Key messages in the
6786.00s: top half, defensive lines to take if
6788.72s: pressed on the bottom half. Right. And
6792.16s: bullet pointed. Huh. Were you ever
6794.72s: reprimanded for saying anything you
6796.32s: shouldn't have said?
6798.40s: No, because I was good at it.
6801.60s: Fair enough. Well, you've been good so
6804.40s: far, I'll tell you
6805.96s: that.
6808.84s: Um I mean this here's a Men in Black
6811.84s: question that we actually already got to
6813.20s: from Hex, so we won't get into that one.
6816.00s: Um okay, this is actually a really
6818.32s: interesting question by Data Queen here.
6826.96s: I'm I'm getting hypnotized by this
6829.12s: coming up on the board here.
6831.76s: She says, "How much reality concerning
6834.32s: UAP did you put in your books Operation
6836.88s: Thunder Chill and Thunder Strike?" I
6840.08s: think it should be Thunder Child.
6842.64s: Something's gone wrong with the board.
6844.08s: There is There is a typo. My mistake.
6846.40s: Operation Thunderchild and Operation
6848.32s: Lightning Strike. Oh, Lightning Strike.
6850.00s: Oh, this is Okay, my bad. This is data
6852.32s: queen's mistake. Uh these are my two
6854.16s: sci-fi novels and the answer is quite a
6857.36s: lot. In fact, the answer is enough so
6861.28s: that these books had to go through
6863.12s: security clearance. Now all my
6865.76s: non-fiction books so on Randle Forest
6869.36s: for example when I teamed up with John
6872.48s: Burrows and Jim Penniston our book there
6875.52s: actually it's the only book that ever
6877.28s: had to go both for Ministry of Defense
6881.20s: security clearance in the UK and it went
6883.36s: to dossa in in the US the defense office
6886.48s: of pre-publication and security review
6888.80s: at the Pentagon.
6890.20s: Um, my two sci-fi novels are the only
6893.76s: two sci-fi novels that I'm aware of that
6896.48s: had to go through that government
6898.56s: security vetting. So, I had to give them
6901.44s: the
6902.20s: manuscript and
6904.52s: um had had to wait to get the the green
6908.48s: light and yeah, I put a lot in.
6910.16s: Rendlessham is mentioned, Calvin is
6912.20s: mentioned, Kford is
6914.60s: mentioned, a lot of the what would now
6917.76s: be called the five
6919.24s: observables are mentioned and and yeah,
6922.48s: I I had to be as careful in my science
6925.36s: fiction as in my non-fiction. That is um
6928.48s: incredible to me that somewhere there is
6932.00s: a government official whose job it is to
6935.24s: read officially read fiction books.
6938.24s: Yeah. And and you know what? By one of
6940.40s: these bizarre pieces of irony, that
6942.92s: official once was me.
6946.96s: Not not I've never read officially
6949.60s: sci-fi, but one of my jobs in the
6952.56s: Ministry of Defense was security vetting
6956.36s: of non-fiction books with an air force
6960.40s: angle. So after the first Gulf War and
6963.68s: and just before I actually did the UFO
6966.24s: job, one of my jobs was to read. In
6969.76s: fact, I think it was parallel. I I think
6972.08s: you know because when I was doing that
6973.76s: job, it wasn't 100% of my time on UAP.
6979.84s: And it's it's coming back to me now that
6981.76s: one of my other I mean I I had not
6984.96s: forgotten that this was my job. I'd just
6986.64s: forgotten that they were
6988.12s: concurrent actually.
6990.88s: on when I was doing when I was in that
6993.28s: division um before and during my time on
6998.72s: the UFO desk, I was occasionally given
7002.72s: books on the Gulf War or manuscripts
7005.60s: like Storm Command by General Sepita
7008.56s: Deabilier,
7010.24s: um Tornado Down, uh which was the story
7014.24s: of of what happened to an air two two
7018.24s: twoman crew that got shot down and then
7020.48s: taken as PWS by Iraq, you know,
7024.40s: horrendous story.
7026.20s: Um, I mean, good good book, but
7029.20s: horrendous what they did. I mean, um,
7031.76s: horrendous what was done to them. Mhm.
7033.80s: Uh, so that was my job. But yes, when I
7037.44s: wrote my sci-fi some years later, I I
7040.08s: think I wrote them in about
7042.44s: 1999, somebody in the Ministry of
7044.80s: Defense had to read those science
7047.92s: fiction novels and do the security
7051.12s: vetting. Same with my the the last book
7054.16s: I wrote was actually nothing to do with
7056.24s: UAP. It was uh all about
7058.68s: counterterrorism and and special forces.
7062.96s: Um, and that was called Blood Brothers.
7065.68s: Again, that had
7067.56s: to one of the few thrillers that I I
7070.64s: know that had to be security vetted. But
7072.64s: a lot of a lot of lot of intelligence
7075.60s: officers have constantly doing this.
7078.80s: Actually, that's the one thing that my
7081.52s: former bosses didn't like is is when my
7086.12s: publishers put on the front cover of my
7089.28s: two sci-fi novels. Going back to the
7091.20s: question, the truth can only be told in
7093.36s: fiction.
7095.12s: Wow. They didn't tell me they were going
7097.12s: to do that. And and it was Simon and
7099.84s: Schusta, so it was a hu one of the big
7101.76s: six. Massive. Um and you can't put the
7105.52s: toothpaste back in the tube. And I got a
7107.68s: very
7109.32s: snippy message. And of course, it was
7112.32s: totally I had no idea they were going to
7113.92s: do it. Uhhuh. But once it was done,
7116.64s: Yeah. that did upset a lot of people.
7118.40s: Yeah. and probably triggered a lot of
7119.92s: conspiracy theorists out there, too.
7121.28s: It's like, we knew it. The sci-fi was
7122.96s: telling the truth the whole time. Yeah.
7124.80s: Um, very, very interesting.
7127.96s: Um, is there is there anything that had
7130.56s: to be redacted in those books without
7133.28s: going into it? Was there anything that
7134.80s: they were like, could you reword this or
7136.56s: could you change this? I'm usually very
7140.56s: good at knowing where the line is, not
7142.80s: crossing it. Same with people like Lou
7146.24s: Alzando and and David Grush. they know
7148.40s: where the line is. So, you know, nobody
7150.40s: wants to give Doppser a whole load of
7152.96s: stuff that they're going to say, "Don't
7154.32s: publish. It's just going to waste
7155.92s: everyone's time." So, everyone is pretty
7158.16s: good at writing at an unclassified
7160.24s: level, even if you're writing about
7161.60s: something that is classified, right? I
7163.92s: did slip up, I think, once, and they did
7167.92s: ask me to make a a fairly minor change
7171.60s: to a specific bit in I think Operation
7174.08s: Lightning Strike,
7176.48s: although it might have been Thunder
7177.52s: Child, I can't remember. And same with
7179.60s: Blood Brothers. Actually, there was
7181.20s: quite a there was one particular aspect
7183.36s: of it where they they did ask Yeah. or
7187.28s: and and basically gave me a form of
7189.60s: words for a rewrite. I see. And and of
7192.24s: course I agreed. Of course, you know,
7194.32s: you don't want to I mean, literally, you
7196.00s: would be breaking the law. You could be
7198.24s: jailed. Yeah. Yeah. Um that's very
7201.12s: interesting. That's um that's super
7203.52s: interesting. Was it a big Was it a major
7205.28s: change for the one in in Thunder Strike?
7207.28s: Was it like something uh major or was it
7209.28s: just wording like how you worded
7210.80s: something? There was one specific thing
7213.52s: that they wanted removed. Okay. An
7216.16s: event. Uh yeah, I I can't really go in I
7219.52s: see. say more than that. And was this
7221.84s: event fictionalized in the book or was
7224.00s: it uh No, it was sort of name checked. I
7227.52s: see. I see. And it was like, okay, don't
7229.28s: don't name check. Oh, I see. I see. Oh,
7231.60s: very interesting. Yeah, that just goes
7234.00s: to show you that they did in fact pay
7235.52s: attention and read your whole book. Oh,
7236.96s: yeah. Absolutely. And because and I
7239.28s: would have expected nothing less. I mean
7241.04s: these people, you know, like when I was
7243.44s: doing it with the the Gulf War books,
7245.76s: you would do it not just line by line,
7247.68s: word for word, because your mission was
7251.12s: to make sure that nobody had
7253.88s: inadvertently put anything that's still
7256.16s: classified in there, of course. Yeah.
7258.00s: And and you know, obviously dulging
7261.28s: classified information without lawful
7263.20s: authority is a criminal offense. Yeah.
7265.12s: Yeah. As it as it I think as it should
7267.36s: be. I think you know, national security
7269.04s: is important thing. We often get hung up
7271.04s: in the UAP space about this national
7272.88s: security narrative because of
7274.84s: overclassification. Um but at at its
7277.44s: core it is there to protect us. Yes. Um
7280.72s: you know and and we often forget that I
7282.56s: think in in these semantic sort of
7284.40s: conversations on Twitter is that people
7286.40s: forget that there are classifications
7288.08s: for a reason. Yes. Sometimes you know
7290.72s: there is overclassification which can
7292.48s: become a problem in the long run but I
7295.04s: think yeah at its base I think it's it's
7296.64s: it's uh it's there for good reason. Yes.
7299.12s: I mean it literally in the security
7300.96s: manual
7302.44s: defines the different levels of
7304.64s: classification and from memory you know
7306.80s: for example in the US top secret is
7308.96s: defined
7309.80s: as not verbatim but information the
7313.20s: disclosure of which could cause
7315.36s: catastrophic harm to the national
7317.68s: security of the United States. Mhm.
7320.16s: Yeah. And and I mean, you know, the
7322.00s: point obviously is that when you
7323.36s: declassify these things and say you're
7325.68s: not just telling the American people,
7327.68s: the Canadians, the Brits, whoever it is,
7330.00s: you're telling Russia and China and Iran
7332.88s: and North Korea and ISIS and anyone and
7336.48s: everyone. Yeah. I guess I guess a lot of
7338.32s: the problem with all this is is not only
7340.16s: is there um levels of
7342.92s: classifications um you know within the
7345.60s: countries, but also within the country
7347.76s: itself. And then that's like this sort
7349.68s: of compartmentalized
7351.52s: uh thing where it's like well this is so
7353.84s: sensitive that we can't even tell
7355.36s: another secret agency about it. And and
7358.24s: that's where it becomes I guess highly
7360.64s: highly confusing when you're on the
7362.24s: inside trying to you know have some
7364.48s: information be approved because you have
7366.48s: to go through all these different
7368.16s: intelligence agencies and they have to
7369.68s: coordinate to make sure it's okay. Yes.
7371.68s: And and sometimes you end up playing
7374.72s: phone tag on this and and one time,
7377.60s: nothing to do with UAP, but I had
7380.40s: something and I called someone and said,
7382.32s: "I need to clear this." And they passed
7384.40s: me to someone else and they passed me to
7385.84s: someone else. And then the last person I
7387.52s: spoke to said, "Oh, yeah. I I can't help
7389.68s: this with this, but the person you need
7391.52s: to speak to is a guy called Nick Pope."
7393.92s: And
7396.08s: great. And this this thing this kind of
7398.16s: thing goes on. I mean sometimes it is
7401.64s: baantine and cfkaresque if I can mix
7405.04s: metaphors but I mean yeah
7406.64s: underclassification is a problem but
7408.48s: overclassification too and
7410.20s: mclassification sometimes
7412.92s: people and this is technically illegal
7415.92s: but they classify things because it is
7418.56s: politically embarrassing right as
7421.36s: opposed to something that is genuinely
7423.44s: something that should be classified for
7424.96s: national security purposes right and I
7426.96s: think we're seeing a lot of that with
7427.92s: like the Epstein stuff as well. Um,
7430.24s: looks it looks that way anyways. Um,
7433.36s: unnecessary redaction.
7435.31s: [Music]
7436.44s: Um, okay. This one last question here
7440.16s: and then uh if you don't mind um we
7442.56s: still have time here. Um after after
7444.88s: we're done here, would you mind sticking
7446.24s: around for an extra like 20 20 30
7448.08s: minutes? No problem. We're going to have
7449.44s: an extra conversation for uh the interns
7451.52s: as well. That'll be just for them and
7453.20s: we'll get into some more things. Okay,
7455.28s: last question here.
7461.44s: This is from J. E. Hardy who asks in
7465.60s: your time on UAPs, have you ever seen
7468.96s: shifts in religion by fellow researchers
7471.68s: or even yourself?
7474.08s: Not in myself, but yes, I I have. And
7478.16s: this is I it's such a good question
7480.32s: because it takes us to an interesting
7482.08s: and kind of dark aspect of this.
7486.72s: one person who was involved in this in
7491.28s: in British
7493.72s: intelligence kind of got sucked into
7497.76s: what I would call a sort of end times
7502.36s: fundamentalist kind of
7506.04s: apocalyptic Christian sect sect well not
7509.12s: sect but mindset put it that way
7513.12s: came to believe that we're in the last
7514.64s: of the end of A is the last times and
7519.12s: quite how he convinced himself of this I
7522.88s: am still not entirely sure but it does
7525.92s: tie in
7528.76s: with
7530.36s: something again a little bit dark side
7532.96s: that there is a a faction of people in
7537.16s: intelligence in both the US and the UK
7540.48s: who have convinced themselves that this
7543.44s: or aspects of UAP are demonic.
7547.80s: And one of the when I I came across this
7552.32s: first in the UK and and there was a
7554.76s: maverick priest called Paul
7559.24s: Inglesby who was exerting a a strong
7563.28s: influence on a retired chief of the
7566.72s: defense staff. So so like basically
7569.44s: Britain's most senior ranking you know
7571.92s: the equivalent in the US would be the
7573.76s: chairman of the joint chiefs. I
7576.20s: see this
7578.36s: retired chief of defense staff, Lord
7581.52s: Hill
7582.44s: Norton, was was a great ally and in this
7587.68s: UFO field and and one of you you'd
7591.04s: almost call it like an invisible
7594.28s: college of people of which I was a
7596.80s: member too after I stopped doing this
7599.28s: officially. as I carried on and there
7601.52s: were a group of
7603.00s: us. But some of these people like I said
7606.24s: that this maverick priest Paul Inglesby
7608.88s: started some suddenly exerting a real
7611.60s: influence on Lord Hill Norton who was
7614.00s: like basically the senior member in this
7616.56s: this kind of enterprise or whatever you
7620.08s: call it. and and I I felt this was
7624.40s: really counterproductive because just as
7627.36s: we were trying to stress the defense and
7630.16s: national security aspects of
7632.84s: this along came this faction saying it's
7636.08s: demonic and one of the reasons they
7637.84s: cited a passage in the book of Ephesians
7641.44s: where it talks about Satan as being the
7643.44s: prince of the power of the air
7646.40s: and that was
7648.04s: one passage that they cited. But there
7652.00s: were I think there must have been more
7653.68s: to it than that. But you find it in in
7656.48s: the US as well. Lou Alzando told me I
7659.28s: think he's talked about this publicly
7661.12s: one time when he was briefing someone
7664.00s: even more senior at the Pentagon. They
7667.44s: they said, "Son, go home and read your
7669.84s: Bible." Yeah. And so the Yeah. The
7672.96s: answer to that question is yes. I have
7676.00s: seen this though it's not touched me
7678.40s: personally. And like I say, it it ties
7682.64s: in with this belief that aspects of this
7685.12s: are demonic. And that ties in to this
7688.72s: whole fundamentalist
7691.16s: Christian end times philosophy. And the
7694.64s: the scary thing about that is these
7697.52s: people believe that before you can have
7699.76s: the second coming, which they really
7701.68s: really want, you must first have the
7704.92s: apocalypse, Armageddon. Right? So, this
7708.16s: has even been spoofed in, I think, a
7710.80s: couple of comedy TV shows like Whoops
7713.52s: Apocalypse where they had this character
7715.36s: of the deacon. Um, this this was not
7718.88s: entirely made up. I mean, this this was
7721.76s: not in in that show. It wasn't in
7723.92s: relation to UAP, but you see it in the
7726.16s: UAP field, right? It's like the three
7728.96s: secrets told by Lady of Fatima as well
7731.36s: where the third secret, you know, uh
7733.92s: they they they kept uh the Vatican kept
7736.96s: a secret because it was related to like
7739.52s: potentially like an end times thing.
7741.68s: Yeah. As well. And there's no getting
7743.36s: away from the fact that of course the
7745.20s: theological implications of first
7747.92s: contact or disclosure, whichever you
7750.80s: know you get first, are going to be
7754.80s: profound. And one of the fields that's
7756.88s: going to be most deeply impacted is
7759.72s: religion. And of course, we see every
7762.64s: day sadly, you know, the consequences of
7766.24s: religious division and hatred and
7768.56s: things. Um,
7771.32s: throw an extraterrestrial presence into
7775.28s: the middle of what's already an
7777.84s: explosive situation. Mhm. And it would
7780.32s: be like a hand grenade going off in a
7783.28s: closed barrel.
7784.88s: Yeah, good point. And that's probably
7786.72s: also why the Vatican is, you know, in
7790.08s: communication with the government at
7791.36s: some level about this very subject
7793.92s: because even years ago when they
7796.24s: discovered exoplanets because the
7798.16s: Vatican also has their own sort of
7799.92s: astronomy division and their own
7801.44s: physicists and they have they have all
7803.04s: this as well. But when they started
7805.12s: discovering these exoplanets, you know,
7807.68s: it I think it was it wasn't Bened, it
7811.72s: was prior prior to him, but the pope
7814.16s: came out and said um that we need to
7816.48s: prepare in the event that there is like
7819.32s: more life out there. Yeah. And how to
7822.32s: Yeah. And how to fit that into the
7823.92s: narrative. I think somebody well the
7827.20s: head you mentioned the Vatican um the
7829.68s: head of the the then director of the
7831.44s: Vatican's observatory father Gabrielle
7834.56s: Jose Fues said in May 2008 that there is
7839.92s: no doctrinal objection to the existence
7842.64s: of alien life because man may place no
7845.92s: creative limits upon God. That's right.
7848.64s: Yeah. And then and then subsequently I
7851.28s: think this came up in a press conference
7853.36s: and I I think I can't remember if it was
7856.00s: Benedict or or Francis I think it might
7858.96s: have been Benedict. Francis okay
7862.04s: said and this this was one of the this
7864.56s: is probably on his list of if pressed
7867.20s: but um and he was asked would he baptize
7871.84s: an alien. I remember that and he he
7875.04s: basically said yes. Yeah. And that was
7876.48s: the headline. Yeah. Uh Pope wants to
7878.88s: baptize aliens if they come to Earth.
7880.72s: Like yeah, but of course it particularly
7884.32s: for I mean all the major world religions
7886.96s: are clearly thinking about this at some
7889.44s: level. Some more openly than others. But
7892.64s: of course for Christians it poses a very
7897.36s: profound theological problem. However
7900.32s: much they say they're open to the
7901.84s: possibility. Yeah. Because the problem
7903.92s: of course and I've I've seen this come
7905.60s: up at at a conference um a Royal Society
7909.84s: conference where there were both
7912.08s: cosmologists and astrophysicists but
7914.72s: also theologians
7916.64s: and the thing that caused the biggest
7918.88s: row was well wait if if we find that
7921.76s: there are other civilizations out there
7924.08s: are you saying that Christ died on the
7926.08s: cross for them too and if
7929.48s: not this this idea of Christ dying in on
7932.56s: the cross to take away our sins and to
7935.20s: forgive us is so
7936.84s: central and so unique that if we find
7940.64s: that you know e either it's happened
7943.84s: elsewhere or it hasn't happened that's a
7946.24s: huge problem for Christians even if they
7949.12s: say it isn't right right right yeah that
7951.72s: definitely it definitely brings about
7954.56s: just another list of you know questions
7957.92s: to add on to that and it becomes
7959.76s: increasingly more difficult to sort of
7961.92s: retro retro fit or put the cats back in
7964.00s: the bag, so to speak. Um, you know, this
7966.96s: whole narrative of uh, you know, Jesus
7970.40s: and and and everything else. But, you
7972.48s: know, who knows? Who really knows? You
7974.40s: know what I mean? There's there are
7976.00s: speculations out there that like, oh,
7977.92s: perhaps, you know, this visitation, this
7980.24s: early visitation was one of
7982.16s: extraterrestrials already and that is
7984.00s: part of like the grander thing. So,
7985.76s: well, it's that's ancient astronaut
7987.44s: theory. Exactly. Basically, the idea
7989.12s: that they they came here in our past and
7991.52s: our
7992.36s: ancestors mispersceived them as and then
7995.44s: worshiped them as gods and built great
7998.40s: monuments in commemoration of those
8001.32s: visits. Most of which are all aligned on
8005.12s: Orion, Sirius or the Pleades. Or the
8007.92s: Plleades. Yeah. Fascinating stuff. Uh
8011.52s: Nicholas Pope, you are an absolute
8013.68s: scholar and a gentleman. I appreciate
8015.92s: you opening up uh to me about these
8018.32s: topics and answering all these
8019.52s: questions. It has been a great joy to
8021.44s: have you on my podcast. So, thank you
8023.60s: very much. Thank you. I've enjoyed
8025.52s: coming and this has been a really
8027.12s: fascinating conversation. So, I've
8028.96s: enjoyed it, too. Thank you. Uh Nick, one
8031.04s: last thing before we go. Is there any is
8033.12s: there anything you'd like to plug? Is
8034.56s: there any uh dates or any uh websites
8037.04s: that you would like to tell my audience
8038.40s: about? My website is nickpe.net.
8042.88s: My Twitter or now X is
8048.12s: nickpod standing obviously for Ministry
8050.40s: of Defense. That has started a few
8052.64s: conspiracy theories. The idea that I'm
8054.96s: still secretly working for the
8056.16s: government, but then if it was, I
8058.16s: wouldn't put it in my Twitter handle. Or
8060.64s: would I? It's double bluff. Um, I'm also
8064.40s: doing the Ancient Aliens Live tour,
8068.64s: which I moderate. And so we go around uh
8072.24s: the US. I hope that in time we will
8074.72s: bring it to Canada, to the UK, elsewhere
8077.76s: maybe, but for now it's it's in the US.
8080.40s: Um we we uh I think we've done about 80
8084.16s: dates. So that's ancient
8088.28s: aliensliveour.com. Um it's it's I
8091.04s: moderate it and it's based on the the TV
8094.08s: show, the hit TV show Ancient Aliens,
8096.00s: but you see us live and in person on
8098.56s: stage. So, I do that, but but I think
8100.96s: it's it's
8102.36s: Twitterx at nickpm mod where I tend to
8105.76s: put my breaking news about upcoming
8109.28s: conference appearances, TV interviews
8112.32s: that I link to, big podcasts that I've
8114.88s: done, etc. Great. Well, thank you so
8117.04s: much for that. I really appreciate it.
8119.04s: And if you guys want to see uh Nick and
8121.52s: myself in person, you guys can also sign
8123.68s: up to go to contact in the desert. um we
8126.72s: will both be doing our own uh things
8129.20s: there speaking or having a podcast or
8131.36s: some type of engagement and we'll
8133.28s: probably be present among other you know
8135.68s: spooky characters in the crowd that we
8138.16s: mentioned. So if you want to come out
8139.84s: and say hi uh that'll be happening I
8142.40s: think at the is this end of um what is
8146.16s: it May 29th to June uh third or second
8149.76s: or third. Yes. Yeah, exactly. So if you
8151.92s: want uh check it out at
