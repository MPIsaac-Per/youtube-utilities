2.64s: Yeah, my name is Eric. Spring of 2013, I
5.44s: was flying from Denver to Saskatchewan
7.68s: and uh we were at cruising altitude
10.64s: um just crossed the border into Canada
13.36s: and uh I see out of the starboard side
16.88s: window there's this um flying cigar um
21.44s: pointed on on the end, solid white, no
24.80s: visible means of propulsion. Um not
27.84s: wavy. He was perfectly perfectly in
30.40s: focus to my eye going the opposite
32.80s: direction as us at the uh same altitude
36.96s: and uh it passed. It was probably going
40.96s: oh I don't know 700 800 mph and it was
44.56s: very brief. Um saw it and it was gone. I
47.28s: wish I'd had my phone out and we saw
49.04s: cigar- shaped UFOs like that with decent
53.60s: regularity.
55.36s: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
57.12s: another episode of Debriefed. My name is
59.04s: Chris Ramsey and today we're going to be
60.72s: reading through a document that was
61.92s: allegedly written in
63.88s: 1947 by none other than Albert Einstein
67.36s: and Robert Oppenheimer. This document is
69.60s: titled The Relationships with
71.52s: Inhabitants of Celestial Bodies. Now,
74.64s: because this was written in June 1947,
77.20s: that would have been 1 month prior to
79.28s: the famous Roswell crash. But this might
83.20s: have been timely because I believe in
85.44s: June was also the sightings from none
88.00s: other than Kenneth Arnold. June 24,
92.84s: 1947. Later, when asked by a reporter to
95.44s: describe how they flew, Arnold said
98.16s: their motion was like saucers skipping
100.32s: over water. In the papers the next day,
103.76s: the world first saw the term flying
106.40s: saucer. I've seen something. Hundreds of
108.64s: pilots have seen something in the skies.
111.52s: We have dutifully reported these things.
114.88s: Those were kind of the first mass
117.96s: reported sightings of UFOs where a fleet
121.04s: of UFOs was spotted as he was flying his
123.20s: airplane and it made national headlines
125.36s: and was a bit of a precursor to the UFO
127.92s: craze. So after hearing all of that,
130.04s: allegedly Robert Oppenheimer and Albert
132.96s: Einstein got together and put together
135.12s: sort of a game plan on what they thought
138.08s: the reason for the extraterrestrial
141.04s: visit might be. This document just kind
142.88s: of surfaced online. Nobody really knows
144.40s: the origins of the document. Um it's
147.20s: didn't actually get released with the
149.16s: MJ12, you know, uh leak that was put out
152.16s: by uh Jamie Shandera and Stanton
154.96s: Freriedman. This was independently
157.68s: released. Now, obviously, there are a
159.28s: lot of people out there that are going
160.56s: to put this in the hoax basket, which I
163.20s: totally understand, but as you know, you
166.40s: know, Area 52 and once we're sat in this
169.04s: office with these documents, we'd love
171.28s: to suspend our disbelief because, as you
173.68s: know, belief sometimes gets in the way
175.60s: of a good story. So, I'm looking forward
178.72s: to having a read through. Now, I know a
180.80s: lot of you were very very uh upset that
183.36s: that was the end of the Lerta files, and
185.44s: I appreciate all of you for for, you
187.92s: know, watching that and supporting that.
189.84s: I had such a fun time reading through
191.68s: it, and I am currently looking into more
196.56s: discussions and alleged communications
199.20s: between extraterrestrial beings and, you
202.08s: know, some very fortunate humans. Uh,
204.56s: those documents are sprinkled around the
207.20s: internet. I have gathered them and I am
209.04s: currently preparing a read through on
211.68s: some heavier stuff regarding uh these
213.96s: documentations. But today, this is kind
216.00s: of a buffer. This one's going to be a
218.00s: little bit of a pallet cleanser in
220.40s: regards to the alien agenda. And we got
223.20s: some other documents here that mention
225.20s: connections between UFOs, aliens, Albert
228.00s: Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, which
229.84s: we'll get through prior to the main meat
231.92s: just to lay the groundwork a little bit.
234.40s: But before we do this, folks, here's a
236.56s: word from our
238.04s: sponsors. Oh, here at Area 52, we spend
241.60s: our time digging deep into secret
243.52s: projects, unexplained phenomena, and the
246.08s: digital shadows most people don't even
247.84s: know exist. But the deeper you go,
252.32s: the more eyes are watching.
255.04s: You see, I'm not just talking about
256.32s: government agencies or beings from Zeta
258.32s: Reticuli. I'm talking about data
260.16s: brokers. These faceless companies
262.24s: collect everything about you, your
263.76s: searches, your shopping habits, and even
265.60s: your location, then sell it off like
267.60s: it's clearance day at the Pentagon.
269.52s: That's why I use Incogn. You see, Incogn
272.32s: is a real world solution to a very real
274.64s: problem. You give them permission once,
277.12s: and they start contacting dozens,
278.96s: sometimes hundreds of data brokers on
281.04s: your behalf, forcing them to delete your
283.36s: personal info. Not hide it, not mask it,
287.28s: delete it. It's your digital vanish
289.92s: routine and it works. So, click the link
292.24s: below at
293.96s: incogn.com/eria52 and use code area52 to
296.72s: get 60% off an annual plan. You see, the
299.92s: truth is out there, but your data
302.72s: doesn't have to
303.80s: be. All right, we paid the bills. Like
307.92s: this video, subscribe, hit the
310.64s: notification bell, and let's get into
312.56s: it. So, we're just going to touch on
314.40s: Albert Einstein for a second here. The
316.80s: first time Einstein was asked about
318.40s: aliens was in the London Daily Mail in
321.04s: January 1920 where he is quoted saying,
324.40s: "There is every reason to believe that
326.24s: Mars and other planets are inhabited.
328.96s: Why should the Earth be the only planet
330.96s: supporting human life? It is not
332.96s: singular in any other respect. But if
335.12s: intelligent creatures do exist, as we
337.28s: may assume they do elsewhere in the
338.96s: universe, I should not expect them to
340.80s: try to communicate with the Earth by
342.40s: wireless radio. Light rays, the
344.64s: direction of which can be controlled
346.32s: much more easily, would more probably be
348.64s: the first method attempted. So this
350.72s: statement was made in response to
352.32s: contemporary speculations by radio
354.24s: pioneer Julie Elmo Maronei, who had
357.04s: reported receiving mysterious signals he
359.04s: thought might have originated from Mars.
360.88s: So you can really see the scientific
362.64s: curiosity that Einstein had during that
365.68s: era regarding life beyond Earth. So
368.16s: let's fast forward to Roswell and
370.40s: Wednesday, July 9th in 1947, newspaper,
374.24s: The Irish Times says this. The US War
377.44s: Department stated last night that they
379.44s: were without news of the New Mexico
381.36s: flying saucer and were checking with
383.36s: Roswell. Professor Einstein told a UP
386.96s: correspondent he had absolutely no
390.16s: comment to make. How does Einstein go
393.04s: from being open-minded to absolutely
395.60s: closed down? In the April edition of the
398.44s: 1952 Life magazine, there was an article
401.04s: entitled, "We have visitors from space."
403.76s: This kind of kicked off a bit of a
406.08s: flurry of inquisitive minds looking into
409.28s: the UFO and alien phenomenon. Well,
411.60s: little did they know that July of the
413.12s: same year that phenomenon would present
415.12s: itself over the capital and the White
417.92s: House. The press went wild with the
419.76s: headlines reading, "Saucers swarm over
422.96s: capital." And amidst the surge of the
424.80s: public's interest in UFOs, Albert
426.72s: Einstein received a letter from Reverend
428.80s: Lewis A. Gardner. Did he believe saucers
431.28s: came from space, specifically Mars or
433.12s: Venus? Gardner wondered. Or were UFOs
435.68s: some kind of advanced military
437.36s: technology experiments created by the US
439.92s: Air Force? or America's foes. Well,
443.36s: renowned physicist and celebrity at the
445.84s: time, Albert Einstein responded with his
448.40s: own letter. So, from the Institute for
450.80s: Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,
453.92s: July 23rd, 1952, he writes, "Dear sir,
457.76s: those people have seen
460.12s: something. What it is, I do not know and
463.36s: I am not curious to know. Sincerely
466.00s: yours, Albert Einstein." Now, I find it
469.36s: a little bit odd that that would be the
472.08s: entire content of his response. Being
474.80s: one of the greatest thinkers of our
477.28s: time, it would surprise me to hear that
480.00s: someone of his creative nature would
484.44s: even dismiss the topic entirely. So, it
488.24s: does make me question whether or not he
490.48s: was involved with UFOs. You know, who
492.72s: knows? Perhaps he wasn't interested and
494.80s: perhaps this interfered with his, you
497.12s: know, current theory of relativity. But
498.72s: I just have a hard time believing
499.92s: Einstein wouldn't be interested in this
502.08s: phenomenon if everybody was reporting on
504.40s: it. Frank Edwards, an early radio
506.72s: pioneer and author of several UFO books,
509.68s: was giving a lecture to a Detroit,
511.28s: Michigan audience in 1956. Edwards made
514.64s: statements about Einstein that he
516.08s: believed to be true based upon his
517.76s: sources and his understanding of
519.20s: historical circumstance. Edwards
520.96s: maintained that just four years prior in
523.08s: 1952, Albert Einstein had delivered an
525.84s: urgent message to then President Harry
527.92s: Truman. Einstein warned that Truman's
530.56s: shootown policy of UFOs over DC was
534.16s: unwise. And I know what Mr. Einstein
536.96s: told him. He said, "Mr. President,
539.92s: anyone who can cross millions of miles
542.40s: of space will be able to take care of
545.12s: himself after he gets there. Don't start
547.84s: something you can't finish." Then there
549.76s: was the case of Dr. Shirley Wright. This
552.24s: is a confession tape by Dr. Wright who
556.32s: says that she studied under Albert
558.16s: Einstein at Princeton and was I guess
561.84s: taken to the crash at Roswell and was
564.56s: given a tour inside the craft, shown the
567.60s: bodies where there lay eight dead and
570.56s: one alive, and even had an exchange in
573.36s: communication with one of these
574.80s: entities.
576.16s: They indicated to us that they were not
578.48s: from our galaxy. Definitely not from our
580.96s: galaxy. Now, Dr. Wright claims that she
583.12s: was Einstein's assistant, but looking
585.04s: into the files, it doesn't show her as
587.36s: an official assistant. But it does,
588.96s: however, show that she did study under
590.96s: Albert Einstein. So, very interesting.
593.60s: Now, let's go over to Oppenheimer where
595.60s: it gets a little bit more complicated.
597.44s: You see, Oppenheimer was actually a key
599.28s: figure and served as chairman of the
601.20s: Atomic Energy Commission. And for those
603.44s: of you in the UFO sphere, you know how
606.32s: important that was when it came to
608.96s: keeping secrets regarding anything that
611.36s: has to do with radioactive
613.96s: material. Established in 1946 to direct
617.60s: the use of atomic energy, the United
620.00s: States Atomic Energy Commission is
621.92s: responsible to the president. As for
624.08s: nuclear weapons, the work is done by
626.64s: contractors at government-owned
628.48s: facilities under close AEC supervision.
631.92s: In cooperating with the Department of
633.68s: Defense, the AEC performs research,
636.68s: development, testing, and production of
639.04s: nuclear weapons required for national
641.36s: defense. Now, when this commission was
643.20s: created, it basically transferred what
644.88s: the government was working on in terms
647.20s: of atomic and nuclear energy to the
649.76s: private sector. Companies could
651.84s: basically maintain confidentiality over
654.16s: their process, effectively placing
656.16s: control of nuclear related knowledge
658.16s: firmly within their own hands. Now, we
660.64s: all know Oppenheimer was part of the
662.32s: Manhattan Project where, you know,
664.32s: secretly the world's best physicists got
666.80s: together to create the atomic bomb. And
669.76s: if you were to create some type of group
671.60s: that were to study, let's say
673.40s: hypothetically, the UFO phenomenon or
676.24s: even retrieve some of these crashed
678.52s: vehicles, you would have to consider
680.80s: Oppenheimer for the task. Now, I'm going
683.04s: to take you back to January 1950 where a
685.76s: very interesting book was released by
687.52s: none other than Donald Kho entitled The
690.24s: Flying Saucers Are Real. Kho was a
692.96s: former US Marine Corps major. He
695.04s: suggested that the US government was
696.56s: hiding the truth and claimed that
697.92s: highlevel insiders like Air Force
699.76s: officials had retrieved crashed alien
702.56s: vehicles. Folks, this is January 1950,
706.40s: only a few years after Roswell. This guy
710.00s: was on top of it already. And the only
711.92s: reason I bring this up is because
713.36s: perhaps this might have helped inspire
715.36s: Eleanor Roosevelt because on May 19th in
718.28s: 1950, she wrote a letter to Robert
720.80s: Oppenheimer. After interviewing pilots
722.64s: who reported UFO sightings on her
724.40s: television program, Eleanor Roosevelt
726.24s: received materials from a fringe group
728.40s: claiming that UFOs were piloted by
730.88s: interdimensional beings. This fringe
733.04s: group known as Borderland Sciences
734.88s: Research Associates and she sought
737.28s: Oenheimer's opinion on the matter. She
739.76s: asks, "Will you please tell me what you
742.16s: know about the enclosed?" Now, the
744.40s: enclosure is not included, but we can
746.80s: deem what was included by Oppenheimer's
749.60s: response on May 19th, 1950. And the
752.64s: letter reads as follows. Dear Mrs.
754.48s: Roosevelt, thank you for your good note
756.64s: of May 16th. You sent me a letter to you
759.68s: from Mr. Schultz and some mimograph
762.88s: material from the Borderland Sciences
764.96s: Research Associates, and you asked me
767.44s: what I knew about it. The only honest
769.36s: answer is that I know nothing whatever.
771.68s: Neither the Borderland associates nor
773.76s: the man who comprise it are known to me,
776.24s: even by reputation. The papers all deal
779.20s: with an attempted explanation of the
780.64s: flying discs. And they all start with
782.72s: the assurance that there were such
784.56s: things. This, of course, I do not
786.72s: believe. Some very solemn attempts were
788.80s: made to see whether there are any
790.24s: physical happenings corresponding to the
791.92s: many reports of flying discs. It has
794.24s: been reported in the press that the Air
795.76s: Force has made such an investigation.
798.00s: There is not any credible evidence and
800.56s: certainly the kind of explanation
802.24s: proposed by the Borderland Associates
804.00s: does not lead one to believe in the
805.60s: phenomenon they are trying to explain.
808.00s: There is perhaps one thing one can
809.52s: learn. It is not just that men and even
811.68s: their accounts of what they see and
813.12s: experience are fallible and subject to
815.28s: error. It is that arriving at the truth
817.60s: can often be a more difficult and
819.12s: troublesome thing than we might like to
820.80s: think. During the war, very shortly
822.64s: before the test of the first atomic
824.16s: bomb, people at Los Alamos were
825.92s: naturally in a state of some tension. I
828.32s: remember one morning when almost the
830.08s: whole project was out of the doors
832.88s: staring at a bright object in the sky
835.28s: through glasses, binoculars, and
837.44s: whatever else they could find. And
839.28s: nearby Kirtland Field reported to us
841.36s: that they had no interceptors which had
843.28s: enabled them to come within range of the
845.36s: object. Our director of personnel was an
847.96s: astronomer and a man of some human
850.64s: wisdom and he finally came to my office
853.68s: and asked whether we could stop trying
855.36s: to shoot down Venus. I tell this story
858.16s: only to indicate that even a group of
859.76s: scientists is not proof against the
861.44s: errors of suggestion and hysteria. With
864.40s: every warm good wish, Robert
866.48s: Oppenheimer. That is an official letter
868.24s: from Robert Oppenheimer. And to
870.20s: me, that is unsatisfactory. I know what
873.44s: you're thinking out there if you're a
874.40s: skeptic. You're like, well, there you
875.28s: go. He wasn't involved. I mean, if you'd
878.80s: asked him if he was involved in the
880.56s: Manhattan project prior to that, he
882.64s: would have also had to say, "I don't
884.16s: even know what you're talking about."
885.52s: So, we can't assume that he wasn't
887.92s: involved based on him saying, "I wasn't
890.04s: involved." He was involved in secret
892.32s: projects. Also, that prominent
894.32s: astronomer that he's referring to is
896.32s: probably none other than the famed
898.32s: debunker and MJ12 founding member Howard
901.76s: Menzel. This guy's entire job was to
904.32s: cover up and suppress anything related
906.08s: to UFOs. Trying to prove whether or not
908.80s: these things come from outer space or
910.48s: not. It's clear that they don't. And if
912.40s: you want to know more about Robert
913.44s: Oppenheimer's involvement in the AEC, I
916.40s: highly suggest you go check out American
918.32s: Alchemy, who does various deep dives on
921.44s: Robert Oppenheimer's involvement,
923.12s: Tatowns and Brown, uh, and and just
925.52s: basically the US government's oversight
927.76s: on UFOs breaching our very sensitive
930.80s: airspace and especially next to these
933.76s: nuclear bases. Now, there have been
935.60s: other mentions of Oenheimer's
937.12s: involvement, the crash at Aztec by
939.44s: Steinman. Uh he does briefly mention
941.76s: Oenheimer being tangentially related to
944.00s: this somehow uh and suggests that he
946.48s: might have even been part of a crash
948.24s: retrieval team. UFO researcher Donald
950.32s: Berles had also put out a book entitled
952.64s: UFO secrecy in the fall of J. Robert
954.88s: Oppenheimer. You know, the credibility
956.64s: of that is still highly debated among
958.56s: skeptics and believers alike. So take
961.28s: with that a grain of salt. Uh today,
963.36s: again, just saying we're just going to
964.96s: read through it and act as though it is
967.04s: true and see what we can take away from
970.24s: some of the smartest men to ever live.
972.88s: Talking about one of the most important
975.12s: subjects of mankind. I'm pretty excited
978.08s: about this. Let's go. All right. June
980.08s: 1947. The relationships with inhabitants
982.40s: of celestial bodies. Relationships with
984.88s: extraterrestrial men presents no
986.64s: basically new problem from the
988.24s: standpoint of international law. But the
990.88s: possibility of confronting intelligent
992.64s: beings that do not belong to the human
994.56s: race would bring up problems whose
996.16s: solution it is difficult to
999.00s: conceive. In principle, there is no
1001.44s: difficulty in accepting the possibility
1003.20s: of coming to an understanding with them
1005.20s: and of establishing all kinds of
1006.80s: relationships. The difficulty lies in
1009.44s: trying to establish the principles on
1011.44s: which these relationships should be
1014.36s: based. In the first place, it would be
1016.80s: necessary to establish communication
1018.48s: with them through some language or other
1020.64s: and afterwards as a first condition for
1023.04s: all intelligence that they should have a
1025.76s: psychology similar to that of men. At
1028.00s: any rate, international law should make
1029.76s: place for a new law on a different
1031.72s: basis. And it might be called law among
1034.80s: planetary peoples following the
1037.20s: guidelines found in the Pentatuk. What's
1040.56s: that? Pentetuk. Looking at Pentatuk
1043.28s: refers to the first five books of the
1045.28s: Bible. I see. So, Genesis, Exodus,
1048.40s: Leviticus, Numbers, and
1050.68s: Deuteronomy. Okay. So obviously the idea
1053.60s: of revolutionizing international law to
1055.68s: the point where it would be capable of
1057.28s: coping with new situations would compel
1059.92s: us to make a change in its structure. A
1062.32s: change so basic that it would no longer
1064.80s: be international law. That is to say as
1067.52s: it is conceived today but something
1069.28s: altogether different so that it could no
1071.52s: longer bear the same name. So
1073.76s: essentially, he's just saying that we
1075.44s: would have to rewrite how we uh even
1079.44s: have like our most fundamental laws
1081.76s: because we would have to include this
1083.44s: extraterrestrial life. We continue, if
1086.56s: these intelligent beings were in
1087.84s: possession of a more or less culture and
1090.80s: a more or less perfect political
1092.92s: organization, they would have an
1094.64s: absolute right to be recognized as
1096.56s: independent and sovereign peoples. We
1099.52s: would have to come to an agreement with
1101.20s: them to establish the legal regulations
1103.20s: upon which future relationships should
1105.60s: be based and it would be necessary to
1107.76s: accept many of their principles. All
1110.32s: right. So basically uh they're taking
1112.56s: the side of of compromise here. They're
1115.12s: you know they are a people. They are
1117.20s: sentient. They have rights. Uh they
1119.28s: probably have their own laws and how do
1121.12s: we integrate theirs with ours? Finally,
1123.76s: if they should reject all peaceful
1125.68s: cooperation and become an imminent
1127.68s: threat to the Earth, we would have the
1129.68s: right to legitimate defense, but only in
1132.16s: so far as would be necessary to enull
1134.72s: this danger. Um, really interesting so
1138.00s: far. Another possibility may exist that
1141.20s: a species of Homo sapiens might have
1143.84s: established themselves as an independent
1145.68s: nation on another celestial body in our
1148.56s: solar system and evolved culturally
1151.44s: independently from ours. Obviously, this
1154.24s: possibility depends on many
1155.72s: circumstances whose conditions cannot
1158.08s: yet be foreseen. However, we can make a
1160.80s: study of the basis on which such a thing
1163.04s: might have occurred. Okay. So now
1165.36s: basically they'll start speculating on
1167.52s: what if humans lived on another
1170.08s: celestial body in this solar system i.e.
1172.88s: Mars or Venus and grew up with a
1175.20s: different cultural society? How would
1177.44s: that affect their laws? And now we get
1179.68s: into some specul uh speculative
1181.80s: territory which I'm all about. In the
1185.76s: first place, living conditions on these
1187.84s: bodies, let's say the moon or the planet
1190.08s: Mars, would have to be such as to permit
1192.40s: a stable and to a certain extent
1194.48s: independent life from an economic
1197.32s: standpoint. Much has been speculated
1199.52s: about the possibilities for life
1200.96s: existing outside of our atmosphere and
1202.72s: beyond, always hypothetically. And there
1205.36s: are those who go so far as to give
1207.36s: formulas for the creation of an
1209.92s: artificial atmosphere on the moon which
1212.48s: undoubtedly have a certain scientific
1214.72s: foundation and which may one day come to
1218.00s: light. This also you have to remember
1219.76s: this was before the moon landing. This
1221.36s: was before we had satellites, right? So
1224.00s: we're thinking it might be possible to
1225.84s: live on the moon and create some
1227.04s: artificial atmosphere or on Mars. Let's
1229.28s: assume that magnesium silicates on the
1231.92s: moon may exist and contain up to 13%
1234.72s: water. Using energy and machines brought
1236.96s: to the moon, perhaps from a space
1238.72s: station, the rocks could be broken up,
1241.56s: pulverized, and then backed to drive off
1244.24s: the water of crystallization. This could
1246.72s: be collected and then decomposed into
1248.88s: hydrogen and oxygen using an electric
1251.52s: current or the shortwave radiation of
1253.68s: the sun. The oxygen could be used for
1255.84s: breathing purposes. The hydrogen might
1258.08s: be used as fuel. Okay, you let me know
1261.20s: if that makes sense because I'm that's a
1264.56s: little above my pay grade over here. All
1266.24s: right, we are investigators. We're not
1269.12s: physicists, scientists, or chemists or
1271.76s: biologists or well, anything of
1273.76s: consequence. Honestly, we're just
1275.12s: reading documents. But you guys
1277.20s: definitely chime in if you know what
1278.80s: that means. In any case, if no existence
1280.96s: is possible on celestial bodies except
1283.28s: for the enterprises for the exploration
1285.68s: of their natural riches with a
1288.08s: continuous interchange of the men who
1290.80s: work on them unable to establish
1292.56s: themselves there indefinitely and be
1295.28s: able to live isolated and to live
1297.92s: isolated life independence will never
1300.40s: take place. Now we come to the problem
1303.12s: of determining what to do if the
1305.36s: inhabitants of the celestial bodies or
1307.76s: extraterrestrial biological entities
1310.84s: ebees same wording as the MJ12 documents
1314.80s: by the way. So does that prove that this
1317.76s: is real or does that make this a hoax?
1320.16s: You know some people believe the MJ12
1322.00s: documents to be real. If you're curious
1323.92s: about that I made a video uh sort of
1326.32s: introducing you to those documents cuz
1328.32s: there are plenty. Uh have a look at
1330.16s: that. Okay. Number one, if they are
1333.36s: politically organized and possess a
1335.28s: certain culture similar to our own, they
1337.76s: may be recognized as an independent
1340.24s: people, they could consider what degree
1342.32s: of development would be required on
1344.32s: Earth for colonizing. Okay, so that's
1346.56s: one speculative sort of situation or
1349.68s: scenario is that maybe they're just
1352.16s: reconing this place for, you know, what
1355.76s: they need for colonizing. Number two, if
1358.16s: they consider our cult culture to be
1360.16s: devoid of political unity, they would
1362.88s: have the right to colonize. Of course,
1364.56s: this colonization cannot be conducted on
1367.20s: classic lines. Okay? So, if they see us
1370.56s: having uh too much strife and and they
1374.08s: see all the battles happening here,
1375.84s: it'll sort of give them the right to
1378.40s: come and colonize and take over and
1380.08s: clean up this mess. A superior form of
1382.48s: colonizing will have to be conceived.
1384.64s: That could be a kind of toutelage,
1386.40s: possibly through the tacit approval of
1389.92s: the United Nations. But would the United
1392.48s: Nations legally have the right of
1394.00s: allowing such toutelage over us in such
1396.72s: a fashion? Very strange to consider that
1398.72s: they're like, well, they have the right
1400.08s: to
1402.44s: colonize. A slippery
1405.32s: slope. A although the United Nations is
1408.24s: an international organization, there is
1410.08s: no doubt that it would have no right of
1412.36s: toutelage since its domain does not
1414.72s: extend beyond relationships between its
1416.72s: members. It would have the right to
1418.56s: intervene only if the relationships of a
1420.88s: member nation with a celestial body
1423.76s: affected another member nation with an
1426.56s: extraterrestrial people is beyond the
1428.56s: domain of the United Nations. But if
1430.88s: these relationships entailed a conflict
1433.12s: with another member nation, the United
1434.80s: Nations would have the right to
1436.08s: intervene. So basically, only if a
1438.32s: member nation were to attack another
1440.40s: member nation could the UN intervene. B.
1444.00s: If the United Nations were a supra
1447.44s: national organization, it would have
1449.68s: competency to deal with all problems
1451.76s: related to extraterrestrial peoples. Of
1453.92s: course, even though it is merely an
1455.92s: international organization, it could
1457.84s: have this competence if its members
1459.92s: states uh would be willing to recognize
1462.40s: it. Okay. It is difficult to predict
1464.88s: what the attitude of international law
1466.80s: will be with regard to the occupation by
1468.88s: the celestial peoples of certain
1470.64s: locations on our planet. But the only
1472.72s: thing that can be foreseen is that there
1475.44s: will be a profound change in traditional
1477.76s: concepts. Yeah, I I would think so. We
1481.84s: cannot exclude the possibility that a
1483.76s: race of extraterrestrial people, more
1485.60s: advanced technologically and
1487.36s: economically, may take upon itself the
1490.08s: right to occupy another celestial body.
1492.40s: How then would this occupation come
1494.08s: about? By the way, I believe this letter
1495.76s: was written uh for the president but
1498.40s: pending approval. And this was written
1500.00s: in June 47. So this uh would have been
1502.72s: written to Harry Truman at the time.
1504.88s: They're kind of just speculating what
1506.48s: the intera international law would be uh
1510.16s: in regards to the occupation of
1512.00s: celestial peoples. So number one, the
1514.72s: idea of exploitation by one celestial
1516.80s: state would be rejected. They may think
1519.04s: it would be advisable to grant it to all
1521.20s: others capable of reaching another
1522.64s: celestial body, but this would be to
1524.48s: maintain a situation of privilege for
1526.16s: these states. two, the division of a
1529.44s: celestial body into zones and the
1532.08s: distribution of them among Oh, I see. I
1534.96s: see. Okay, hold on. So, they're trying
1536.56s: to predict what it would look like if
1539.44s: they were to come here and demand, you
1543.04s: know, some type of sovereignty over the
1545.20s: land or demand, you know, that they
1547.20s: acquired some of our land in this
1549.84s: colonization effort. And this is kind of
1552.40s: uh what that would look like. So one,
1554.16s: the idea of exploitation by one
1555.60s: celestial state would be rejected. Two,
1557.60s: the division of a celestial body into
1559.92s: zones and the distribution of them among
1562.96s: other celestial states. This would be
1565.68s: present the problem of distribution.
1568.00s: Moreover, other celestial states would
1570.56s: be deprived of the possibility of owning
1572.72s: an area or if they were granted one, it
1575.52s: would involve complicated operations.
1578.52s: Three, indivisible co-s sovereignty,
1582.08s: giving each celestial state the right to
1584.56s: make whatever use is most convenient to
1587.12s: its interest independently of others.
1589.60s: This would create a situation of
1590.96s: anarchy. The strongest one would win out
1593.52s: in the end. And for a moral entity, the
1596.96s: most feasible solution, it seems, would
1599.52s: be this one. submit an agreement
1601.76s: providing for the peaceful absorption of
1603.76s: a celestial race in such a manner that
1606.40s: our culture would remain intact with
1608.16s: guarantees that their presence not be
1610.08s: revealed. Wo actually we do not believe
1613.52s: it necessary to go that far. It would
1616.40s: merely be a matter of internationalizing
1619.12s: celestial peoples and creating an
1621.68s: international treaty instrument
1623.84s: preventing exploitation of all nations
1625.84s: belonging to the United Nations. Okay.
1628.00s: So, kind of giving them land and being
1630.48s: like, just don't interfere with our
1632.36s: stuff. Leave us alone or go underground,
1635.84s: I guess. I don't know. Occupation by
1638.40s: states here on Earth, which has lest all
1641.68s: interest for international law since
1644.16s: there were no more res nullius
1647.56s: territories, not sure what that means,
1649.76s: is beginning to regain all its
1651.36s: importance in cosmic international law.
1654.12s: Occupation consists in the appropriation
1656.80s: by a state of Resnolius. What is
1659.24s: Resnolius? A thing of no one or property
1662.80s: belonging to no one. I see.
1665.04s: Appropriation by a state of which has
1667.84s: lest all interest for international law
1670.00s: since there were no more resol
1671.68s: territories. So there are no states that
1674.08s: belong to no one. You can't give them
1676.00s: that. Obviously until the last century,
1678.08s: occupation was the normal means of
1679.84s: acquiring sovereignty over territories.
1682.24s: When explorations made possible the
1684.24s: discovery of new regions either
1686.24s: uninhabited or in an elementary state of
1689.28s: civilization, the imperialist expansion
1691.76s: of the states came to an end with the
1693.92s: end of regions capable of being occupied
1696.24s: which have now been drained uh from the
1698.64s: earth and exist only in interplanetary
1700.96s: space where the celestial states present
1703.36s: new problems. Okay, so they're saying
1706.24s: like there's nothing left to give them
1707.92s: here. The only things that aren't
1709.20s: claimed are the celestial bodies.
1711.36s: Resnolius is something that belongs to
1713.36s: nobody such as the moon. In
1715.44s: international law, a celestial body is
1718.00s: not subject to the sovereignty of any
1720.00s: state is considered Resnolius. If it
1722.96s: could be established that a celestial
1724.88s: body within our solar system, such as
1727.60s: our moon was or is occupied by another
1730.56s: celestial race, there could be no claim
1733.04s: of Resnolius by any state on Earth. If
1736.56s: that state should decide in the future
1738.24s: to send explorers to lay claim to it, it
1741.28s: would exist as
1743.00s: recommunist, that is that all celestial
1745.76s: states have the same rights over it. And
1748.88s: now to the final question of whether the
1750.96s: presence of celestial astroplanes in our
1754.00s: atmosphere is a direct result of our
1756.64s: testing atomic weapons. The presence of
1759.76s: unidentified spacecraft flying in our
1761.76s: atmosphere and possibly maintaining
1763.44s: orbits about our planet is now however
1767.16s: accepted as de facto by our military.
1771.40s: Okay, that's a bold claim by Oenheimer
1774.56s: and Einstein right there. If true, on
1777.12s: every question of whether the United
1779.04s: States will continue testing of fish
1781.52s: bombs and develop fusion devices,
1784.08s: hydrogen bombs, or reach an agreement to
1787.24s: disarm and the exclusion of weapons that
1790.00s: are too destructive, with the exception
1792.08s: of chemical warfare on which, by some
1794.32s: miracle we cannot explain, an agreement
1796.80s: has been reached. The lamentations of
1799.56s: philosophers, the efforts of
1801.44s: politicians, and the conferences of
1803.84s: diplomats have been doomed to failure
1806.16s: and have accomplished nothing. The use
1808.88s: of the atomic bomb combined with space
1811.12s: vehicles poses a threat on a scale which
1813.76s: makes it absolutely necessary to come to
1816.40s: an agreement in this area. With the
1819.20s: appearance of unidentified space
1820.80s: vehicles, opinions are sharply divided
1823.52s: as to their origin over the skies of
1826.16s: Europe and the United States has
1828.08s: sustained an ineradical fear. That is an
1832.00s: anxiety about security that is driving
1834.32s: the great powers to make an effort to
1836.16s: find a solution to the threat. Okay,
1838.56s: basically these people are scrambling
1840.24s: right now. Governments are jumping on
1842.72s: this thing like what do we do? How do we
1844.32s: contain it? How do we exploit it? How do
1845.92s: we control it? Where do we put it? What
1847.36s: do we do with it? What do we tell the
1848.56s: public? All of the above. Military
1850.88s: strategists foresee the use of
1852.48s: spacecraft with nuclear warheads as the
1854.88s: ultimate weapon of war. Even the
1857.60s: deployment of artificial satellites for
1859.68s: intelligence gathering and target
1862.00s: selection is not far off. The military
1865.36s: importance of space vehicles, satellites
1868.24s: as well as rockets is indisputable since
1871.44s: they project war from the horizontal
1873.68s: plane to the vertical plane in its
1876.08s: fullest sense. Attack no longer comes
1879.52s: from an an exclusive direction nor from
1882.24s: a determined country, but from the sky
1885.36s: with the practical impossibility of
1887.20s: determining who the aggressor is. How to
1890.40s: intercept the attack or how to affect
1893.12s: immediate reprisals. These problems are
1895.68s: compounded further by
1897.64s: identification. How does the air defense
1899.68s: radar operator identify or more
1902.08s: precisely classify this
1904.28s: target? Great questions. Now, this is
1907.04s: interesting that we're mentioning
1908.32s: satellites because the first satellite,
1910.48s: I think, was like the Sputnik in like
1913.56s: 1957. And so, the fact that they're
1916.00s: mentioning satellites here is kind of
1918.32s: interesting. This is supposed to be
1919.28s: 1947. So, unless they know something we
1921.44s: don't or this is a hoax, you know.
1924.24s: However, the idea of satellites did
1926.40s: exist in 1947, but only among
1929.28s: forwardthinking scientists and military
1931.20s: planners. that no artificial satellites
1933.60s: had been launched yet and most people
1935.28s: wouldn't have been aware of them. I see.
1937.44s: So these ideas were already being
1939.04s: floated around by the scientific elite
1942.00s: and uh military establishments. Very
1944.80s: interesting. So not debunked. Thought I
1947.92s: got them on that one. At the present, we
1950.08s: can breathe a little easier knowing that
1951.76s: slowmoving bombers are the mode of
1954.08s: delivery of atomic bombs that can be
1956.24s: detected by long range early warning
1958.56s: radar. But what do we do in let's say 10
1960.96s: years from now when artificial
1962.88s: satellites and missiles find their place
1964.88s: in space? We must consider the potential
1967.60s: threat that unidentified spacecraft
1969.64s: pose. One must consider the fact that
1973.00s: misidentification of these spacecraft
1975.36s: for a intercontinental missile in a
1978.56s: re-entry phase of flight could lead to
1980.88s: accidental nuclear war with horrible
1982.72s: consequences. That's very interesting
1984.72s: because there is actually an agreement
1986.64s: between Russia and the United States and
1989.04s: in that agreement they speak about
1990.92s: unidentified aerial phenomenon being
1994.24s: mistaken for a potential nuke. So in the
1996.96s: event that a UFO shows up on either
1999.28s: radar of either country, they must
2001.92s: notify each other and ask each other if
2004.00s: that was them, which I find completely
2007.04s: ludicrous because if you were to launch
2008.64s: a missile, you know, and they asked you,
2010.72s: "Hey, is that a UFO?" like you would
2012.80s: probably say, "Yeah, yeah, it's a UFO.
2014.40s: Don't worry about it." But he makes a
2016.40s: fair point here. Obviously, very smart
2018.64s: man. Lastly, we should consider the
2020.96s: possibility that our atmospheric tests
2022.64s: of late could have influenced the
2024.88s: arrival of celestial
2026.84s: scrutiny. They could have been curious
2028.88s: or even alarmed by such activity. And
2031.84s: rightly so, for the Russians would make
2034.16s: every effort to observe and record such
2036.56s: tests.
2038.88s: And I mean, you know, that's the thing
2041.12s: when people say, "Well, why are there so
2043.12s: many sightings in the United States? Oh,
2045.04s: it's so weird that it's in the United
2046.64s: States." I mean, it isn't that weird
2048.32s: when you think about
2049.96s: it. Who is the nuclear power of the
2053.20s: world? But not only nuclear, who was
2055.68s: developing radar before anyone else? Who
2058.64s: was playing with high-powered
2061.16s: lasers? Who was launching the most
2063.44s: satellites? And where would that be
2065.60s: happening? Well, it would be happening
2067.36s: probably up and around Los Alamos in
2070.00s: Sandia Labs or White Sands. It that's
2073.20s: where you would want to be if you were
2075.52s: observing this planet and figuring out
2077.44s: what it is we're doing. That's where you
2079.84s: would show up. That's where you would
2081.44s: crash. In conclusion, it is our
2083.84s: professional opinion based on submitted
2085.92s: data that this situation is extremely
2089.32s: perilous and measures must be taken to
2092.32s: rectify a very serious problem are very
2095.52s: apparent. Respectfully, Dr. J. Robert
2098.40s: Oppenheimer, director of advanced
2099.84s: studies at Princeton and Professor
2101.68s: Albert Einstein, Princeton.
2104.80s: uh his response is recorded or the
2107.60s: response here uh is recorded underneath
2110.48s: this letter and it says myself and
2111.92s: Marshall have read this and I must admit
2114.08s: there is some logic but I hardly think
2116.48s: the president will consider it for
2118.24s: obvious reasons. I understand
2120.48s: Oppenheimer approached Marshall while
2122.64s: they
2123.32s: attended ceremony at redacted. As I
2127.04s: understand it, Marshall rebuffed the
2128.88s: idea of Oppenheimer discussing this with
2131.20s: the president. I replied to Gordon and
2133.68s: he agreed. Okay. Basically saying not
2136.72s: sure we should send this to the
2138.24s: president. Uh but all of that might be
2141.20s: for not because one month later there
2145.20s: would be a crash at least one crash if
2147.60s: not two in Roswell, New Mexico. Eight
2151.04s: months later a crash in Aztec, New
2153.76s: Mexico. and several UFO investigators
2157.12s: would be born and we would begin the
2161.04s: long history of eupfologists and the
2166.08s: study of UFOs and the infernal
2170.04s: incessant and eternal battle that is
2173.52s: fought between them and the powers that
2176.44s: be. That was that was an interesting
2179.36s: read.
2181.00s: Um, I hope you enjoyed this little read
2183.68s: through. Shorter video than you're used
2186.08s: to. Um, however, I thought it was very,
2189.28s: very interesting nonetheless. Again, I I
2193.04s: think I would find that
2197.16s: Oppenheimer would be possibly more
2200.88s: involved in the UAP or UFO subject than
2205.04s: Albert Einstein was. Albert Einstein's
2207.12s: refusal to be part of the Manhattan
2209.52s: Project, you know, probably signaled to
2212.40s: the US government that he could not be
2214.48s: trusted. And, you know, there is there
2216.80s: is the other question, however, because
2219.80s: Oppenheimer was brought into court, you
2222.88s: know, for apparently speaking with the
2224.88s: enemy. Um, was that a
2228.68s: front to, you know, when his security
2231.60s: clearances were stripped, was that just
2233.68s: a front?
2235.84s: um while he was sort of backdoor reverse
2239.36s: engineering these crafts and maybe the
2241.36s: heat was taken off him I don't know uh
2244.08s: or was he completely excluded from any
2248.08s: UFO talks but there are many many
2250.80s: scientists of that age of that era that
2254.72s: were possibly involved including all of
2257.04s: the members or some of the members of
2258.56s: MJ12 you know like um you had Dr.
2261.52s: Vanavar Bush and uh Detliff Grank and I
2265.60s: mean so many others but there's clearly
2267.60s: an interest in UFOs and if you were part
2271.92s: of the government back then or the Air
2274.96s: Force or what have you seeing something
2277.84s: or hearing something as alarming as a
2280.32s: UFO crash in Roswell and the
2283.48s: sightings of Kenneth Arnold and then
2286.96s: subsequently the crash at Aztec and all
2290.08s: these other stories that would start
2292.88s: surfacing, you would have to take an
2295.36s: interest. And obviously they did. They
2296.56s: formed, you know, Project Grudge, which
2298.24s: turned which turned into Project Blue
2299.68s: Book. But there were so many other
2301.84s: facets of the military, Air Force, Navy,
2306.24s: uh, that were affected by the
2309.96s: ongoings post nuclear
2313.88s: threat. Everyone was on high alert back
2316.64s: then. I can't imagine really how
2318.80s: stressful that was as a time. You know,
2320.88s: if you speak to your grandparents or
2322.80s: maybe your parents or maybe your
2324.08s: great-grandparents, uh what it was like
2326.16s: back then to live in the Cold War when,
2330.56s: you know, you would
2331.96s: hear sirens going off as a training
2334.72s: exercise for you to duck under your
2336.48s: table to prepare for a nuclear blast. I
2338.56s: mean, that must have been just the most
2340.72s: terrifying thing. Imagine bringing your
2342.72s: kids to school knowing that the Russians
2345.04s: at any point could drop bombs and just
2347.44s: completely obliterate everything you
2350.56s: hold dear. I mean, that must have been
2352.32s: incredibly frightening. It was a very
2354.16s: tense time in the United States. You
2356.32s: know, we have it really, really well
2358.16s: right now. me feel although there are
2360.32s: still conflicts obviously happening
2362.08s: across the globe I feel like the threat
2365.20s: of nuclear war
2367.32s: although is never really
2370.12s: gone definitely hasn't escalated to the
2373.20s: point that it was in the cold war and I
2377.60s: pray and I hope and I you know I just I
2380.88s: wish that
2382.36s: uh we never get to that point it's good
2385.52s: to take a second to be thankful for what
2387.84s: we have and thankful for what we are not
2391.36s: being subjected to. I think these things
2394.24s: will probably be taught in school
2396.08s: eventually. That is my faith that like a
2398.00s: lot of the the material that we're
2400.08s: covering once we find out that this
2401.76s: might be real, uh we're going to have to
2404.56s: rewrite how we teach our children, you
2407.20s: know, when when mass sightings begin
2409.36s: happening or any of anything of that
2412.40s: nature. You know, if that ever is the
2414.08s: case, then we do have to adjust. As they
2416.96s: said, our society is going to shift. Let
2419.44s: me know what your thoughts. Do you think
2420.96s: this is real? Do you think this is BS?
2424.16s: Are you team, you know, crash retrieval
2427.92s: or team fact suppression? I'm just
2430.72s: kidding. What? Let me know. Let me know
2432.56s: your thoughts. I'm curious to know them.
