1.60s: hey I'm a former uh tier one uh operator
5.04s: with uh the US Navy so I've felt a
7.44s: pretty high security clearance through
8.76s: all my years but my encounter actually
10.16s: didn't happen in the military it
11.96s: actually happened uh while I was on
14.52s: vacation uh I went to go visit some
17.00s: family in uh Ecuador uh in May of 2018
20.76s: we got invited to go watch uh kids
23.68s: soccer game sometime during the first
26.80s: half of the game I noticed that
28.80s: everybody kind of stupped
30.68s: um playing and started looking up and
33.44s: about 150 ft in the middle of the
36.84s: daytime clear sky we saw uh a about a
42.40s: 150 ft UFO there was a kind of circle
46.28s: yellow circle kind of in the center
47.56s: surrounded by five smaller circles
50.40s: surrounding it and I've seen pretty much
52.88s: every military vehicle that's been
55.12s: classified and some that you know all
57.88s: the unclassified stuff too during my
59.56s: time as an operator and uh I've never
62.56s: seen anything like it it basically
64.60s: glided along didn't make any sound the
66.76s: weird thing is I felt like kind of
68.16s: electricity in the air while it was
69.56s: going through there was kind of l a
71.16s: slight like buzzing feeling and then it
74.24s: moved just past the soccer field and
76.44s: then took off faster than you could
79.44s: blink ladies and gentlemen welcome back
82.68s: to another episode of debrief my name is
84.64s: Chris Ramsey and today we're going to be
87.16s: continuing our read through of part one
90.44s: of the ler aile so this is a
92.64s: two-part file probably a four-part
95.60s: series uh we've already filmed the first
99.12s: part if you want to check that out and
100.36s: get caught up and if you are caught up
103.08s: then welcome back lerta is the name that
105.28s: this reptilian female gave herself
107.28s: during the interview with this Swedish
109.16s: man in 1999 numerous statements have
112.24s: been declared including the fact that
114.04s: they have been here for millions of
115.44s: years they were here prior to us and
117.56s: that this planet was once fought over by
119.96s: a humanoid race and a different
122.32s: reptilian race the humanoid race
125.28s: eventually won and then Genetically
128.04s: Enhanced our species the hominids here
131.40s: uh the the monkeys that were uh first
133.96s: jumping around in trees as she put it
135.88s: with the intention of making us into
138.00s: sort of slaves to help mine I'm sure uh
142.16s: these Precious Minerals that they were
144.24s: seeking these beings were called the
147.08s: Elohim which then are also present in
150.92s: Hebrew text she's also mentioned the
153.08s: differences physiologically between the
155.56s: reptilians and ourselves uh notably
159.00s: genitalia where we are still you know
163.12s: number one way to go humans but also the
166.00s: birthing process and food they like to
168.80s: as she stated multiple times eat flesh
171.36s: now I was corrected in the comments a
173.28s: few times because flesh is also because
176.48s: there speak this was translated from
178.44s: Swedish and the German manic languages
180.72s: use the word fles like in German which
182.92s: means meat so that's probably Lost in
185.64s: Translation but it doesn't help when you
187.92s: read the text in English to hear a
190.08s: reptilian say I love flesh before we
192.88s: jump into the rest of the readr if you
194.68s: wouldn't mind leaving a like on this
196.60s: video subscribing and hitting the
198.20s: notification Bell maybe even leaving a
200.08s: comment to help Propel us into a
202.44s: favorable algorithm obviously the
205.48s: YouTube and Google Gods sometimes frown
208.92s: so unfavor on people who speak of these
212.12s: underground dwelling reptilians so it
214.72s: helps if you just leave a comment it it
217.00s: goes a long way one more thing we just
219.64s: launched our website big deal huge deal
222.52s: for me area 52. shop is now live we got
226.48s: many products there many cool things
228.04s: that we've been working on but one thing
229.32s: that I've been working on for a very
230.52s: long time and it has finally come to
233.00s: fruition is the Area 52 deck of cards
238.08s: which contains a few
240.56s: secrets secrets which if you choose to
243.92s: follow the rabbit will lead you down a
247.48s: varying amount of holes and lastly
250.52s: before we proceed I kindly ask that you
252.64s: suspend your disbelief because belief
254.68s: often only gets in the way of a good
256.72s: story in today's UAP and UFO landscape
260.44s: it's hard to get unfiltered news news
264.00s: that isn't biased on one side or the
266.12s: other news that isn't sensationalized or
268.40s: click baited to grab your attention
270.48s: when I'm looking into a topic like this
272.20s: it's important for me to get the facts
274.96s: and not only for them to be factual but
277.28s: for them to be unbiased and that's where
279.76s: today's sponsor comes in this video
281.28s: sponsored by ground news ground news is
283.68s: phenomenal not only does it have a
285.32s: feature which allows me to filter the
287.16s: type of news that I want but it
288.92s: automatically grabs every single news
291.24s: source from a story and separates it
294.00s: into categories letting me know whether
295.80s: it's leaning left leaning right or just
299.08s: how I like it
300.24s: right down the middle let's take this
301.96s: story for example the headline on the
303.80s: left reads Timber tells Matt Gates
306.20s: aliens are hiding under the sea I'm not
308.28s: worried about them harming
309.92s: me while the article on the right says
313.76s: Congressman makes Earth shattering UFO
316.12s: claim might terrify people in the one of
318.96s: the middle reads Timber chett says he
321.12s: believes aliens have underwater bases on
323.68s: Earth you can see the difference in the
326.32s: reporting based on what political
328.48s: affiliation is attached to the story but
330.72s: what if only one side is talking about a
332.92s: certain topic and the other side
334.44s: completely ignores it well that's the
336.28s: blind spot feature allowing you to
338.40s: really see what's being left out of your
340.96s: newsfeed so don't wait to subscribe by
343.28s: going to ground news.com area or click
345.84s: the link in the description to save 40%
347.92s: off your annual Vantage subscription and
350.20s: finally be able to beat the algorithm
352.04s: when it comes to the news that's being
353.48s: deliver to you folks we paid the bills
356.72s: it's time to get in to part two of the
359.16s: first part
360.56s: of the little certif files all right so
362.96s: we left off uh they were talking about
366.32s: how the Elohim were featured in The
370.16s: Bible um and that even the reptilians
372.80s: were featured in The Bible unfavorably
374.68s: apparently she asks should I continue
378.00s: and now we move on to O K is he um as he
384.36s: names himself question no not now I've
387.56s: made some notes about your history and
389.08s: now I have some
390.80s: questions
392.36s: answer please ask question first of all
396.40s: you handle with a very large time scale
399.52s: you claim that your primitive ancestors
401.28s: lived together with the Dinosaurs
403.48s: survived the as you called it artificial
406.56s: cataclysm and evolved then over 40
409.56s: million years and your Evolution was
411.92s: completed 10 million years ago this
415.20s: sounds very unbelievable to me can you
417.60s: say something to this
420.20s: answer I understand that this must sound
422.52s: absolutely unbelievable to you because
424.68s: you are a young and genetically
426.16s: engineered species your historical
428.68s: Horizon ends at a scale of just some
430.88s: thousands of years and you think this is
433.36s: right but it isn't this is
436.52s: impossible your programmed mind is
438.60s: obviously not able to handle with such
440.52s: large time scales our Evolution time may
443.16s: seem incredible long for you again
445.28s: please forgive the amount of grammatical
448.96s: mispronounce iations or
450.52s: misinterpretations here this is
452.96s: translated from Swedish to English so
455.00s: there may be some things here as I read
456.60s: them out loud I kind of cringe at what
458.12s: I'm saying but you know let's move past
460.68s: that please our Revolution time may seem
462.84s: incredible long to you but this is in
465.00s: fact the original way of nature remember
467.48s: your early mammal ancestors developed
469.60s: together with dinosaurs and they
470.88s: survived the bomb like us they evolved
474.16s: slowly during the next millions of years
475.88s: and they divided into various species
477.72s: and shapes some of them larg larer some
480.24s: of them
481.48s: smaller this is evolution of the body
485.00s: but what about their mind and
486.64s: intelligence they were simple animals
489.48s: the mammals evolved since let us say 150
493.00s: millions of years but only in the last 2
495.60s: three millions of years they were able
497.72s: to become intelligent and thinking and
500.12s: within this small period beings like you
502.04s: were created from
504.12s: nature 148 millions of years time for
507.36s: the evolution of an animal-like m
510.16s: 2 millions of years time for the
512.44s: development or more or less intelligent
514.72s: beings like you ask yourself do you
517.84s: really think this accelerated evolution
519.96s: is natural then your species is more
522.84s: ignorant than I've thought we have not
525.08s: evolved wrong but
527.04s: you okay lerta here is claiming that the
530.72s: human species was aided in their
533.04s: development especially considering their
535.04s: intelligence now Natural Evolution does
537.80s: exist she is not saying it doesn't exist
540.40s: but a guided evolution in this case was
542.88s: necessary in order to reach the heights
546.12s: of intelligence that we have reached in
548.20s: the last couple million years compared
550.36s: to the hundreds of millions of years
552.04s: that we've been around apparently and so
553.64s: if we were to compare this to Modern
556.60s: paleontology uh it would say that we
558.52s: were only hominids were only around for
560.56s: several hundred thousands of years as
562.96s: opposed to millions and hundreds of
564.72s: millions and so you know if true very
567.88s: cool I also seem to think that our on
570.72s: our personal time scale of several
574.00s: hundred thousands of years versus the
576.84s: last 5 to 10,000 years there did also
580.92s: seem to be an accelerated growth
583.80s: intellectually I
586.12s: often entertain the idea as well that
589.92s: especially since the meteoric rise in
593.00s: propulsion systems and energy
595.24s: enhancement or energy uh harnessing that
598.28s: we've been going through
599.88s: we might have also been aided by you
603.36s: know extraterrestrial technology at some
605.40s: point especially after the 4S this is
608.44s: interesting but you know if I were to
611.16s: bring my Tesla back into the
614.96s: 1500s or even earlier back into the year
618.24s: one or even earlier than that let's
620.08s: bring my Tesla back 5,000 years ago the
623.56s: people who discover that Tesla will
625.84s: never be able to re-engineer back
628.64s: engineer the technology that my Tesla
630.60s: has impossible impossible that their
633.84s: feeble Minds can comprehend the amount
636.96s: of technology that is put into that is
639.60s: just no way but what they will do is
641.88s: they'll take apart the door and they'll
643.68s: use the metal to help Shield their Huts
647.04s: they'll use the glass to perhaps cut
649.20s: hide rest assured that they will never
652.00s: figure out how that Tesla works and
655.72s: without my phone or my Tesla card you're
659.52s: not going to be able to drive that and
661.80s: so they can turn the wheel and they can
664.68s: maybe bring the windows down until the
666.40s: batteries run out but after that they'll
668.00s: be taking it apart and using it to
669.64s: enhance their own lives I think that is
673.44s: a accurate representation of what
675.60s: happened in the event that we did
678.48s: recover crashed UFOs I think much of the
682.04s: same we've used a lot of their
684.04s: components to enhance our own lives but
688.04s: uh failed it you know actually back
690.88s: engineering these things getting
692.96s: sidetracked get what are we talking
694.68s: about here let's get back let's get back
697.00s: to reality let's get back to the talking
699.00s: lizard lady question I understand but I
701.52s: have another question you've mentioned
703.08s: many facts about the ancient war between
704.76s: the alien 65 million years ago this
707.24s: happened very long before your kind
709.20s: really became really intelligent as far
711.64s: as I've understood you why do you know
713.88s: so many things about that first war and
716.40s: about the evolution of our species good
719.00s: question answer this is a good question
721.92s: much better than the previous and I've
724.48s: not explained it properly to you our
726.76s: knowledge about the first war comes
728.24s: completely from ancient artifact which
730.40s: was found around 16,000 years ago from
733.00s: our archaeologists on the continent you
735.36s: call North America today they found
738.04s: there a round plate with a diameter of
739.92s: approximately 47 of your centim the
742.52s: plate was made of an even for us unknown
745.48s: magnetic material and inside the plate
747.64s: there was another smaller Crystal plate
749.64s: which contained an enormous amount of
751.44s: information coded in the molecular
753.52s: structure of the crystal this quote
755.96s: unquote memory plate was manufactured
758.24s: from the last bomb survivors of H of the
761.16s: human race from proon already 65 million
764.24s: years ago but it was completely intact
766.80s: when we found it our scientists were
768.80s: able to encode the messages and data and
771.00s: so we heard the first time about the
772.84s: events which took place in the distant
774.72s: past and which led to both the
776.48s: extinction of the Dinosaurs the plate
778.28s: contained detailed descriptions of both
780.12s: species but more about the humanoids and
782.64s: about the events and weapons including
784.44s: the fusion bomb it contained also a
786.68s: description of the animals and soran on
788.92s: the earth including our pre-int
791.00s: telligent ancestor species the rest of
793.32s: our knowledge about our Evolution comes
795.20s: from skeletons and from back reading and
797.68s: decoding of our DNA you see we know the
801.16s: real truth about our Roots since 16,000
803.84s: years before that time there was a more
806.84s: religious idea of our creation that's
809.60s: interesting so I think the you know if
812.32s: this is alar or if this is truth or
814.12s: whatnot but I think the the point here
816.08s: is to really throw up a mirror in front
818.72s: of us and say like hey once you get past
821.28s: this religious thing you know there's a
824.04s: whole there's a whole world waiting for
825.88s: you after that question what has
828.24s: happened with both alien species answer
831.80s: we don't know exactly the surviving
833.76s: humanoids on Earth obviously died in the
835.72s: years after the bomb and others of their
838.08s: kind and the reptilians never came back
840.36s: to Earth as far as we know concerning
843.48s: the reptilian aliens there is a
844.96s: possibility that this that it was a
846.60s: physically impossible for them to return
848.88s: because the matter between bubbles is
850.72s: sometimes in Rapid movement the current
852.64s: theory is that both species had ceased
855.52s: to exist during millions of years that's
858.36s: an interesting uh thing to say that the
861.92s: matter between bubbles is sometimes in
864.36s: Rapid movement the matter between what
867.84s: would that int what would that mean
870.24s: why would that be the reason that we
871.68s: don't see them
872.96s: anymore they're just acting on a
875.24s: different frequency than we are question
877.72s: you've mentioned skeletons of your kind
879.72s: how can it be that human scientists
881.84s: haven't found any trace of you and your
883.80s: ancestors if you really live for such a
885.72s: long time on this planet we have found
888.08s: many skeletons of primitive dinosaurs
890.16s: but none of an advanced reptilian being
892.64s: with a larger skull and brain and a hand
895.04s: with a thumb as you have described
897.12s: before answer yes you have but your
901.00s: great scientists were not able to
902.52s: reconstruct the skeletons completely
904.56s: because they wanted to reconstruct
906.04s: reptilian animals not intelligent beings
909.40s: you would laugh if you know how many of
911.16s: the especially small soran skeletons in
914.00s: your museums are totally wrong
915.52s: constructions of never existing beings
918.64s: because you used uh many bones which
920.68s: didn't really belong together and
922.20s: sometimes you made artificial bones if
924.24s: something was missing you need to
925.80s: construct an animal soran many of your
928.36s: scientists are aare of this problem but
929.84s: they don't like to make it public
931.88s: because they can't explain it and they
933.80s: claim that the right bones were just
935.72s: missing and their construction is Right
938.24s: many bones of us were used for Iguanodon
940.32s: reconstructions for example the hands
942.60s: with the visible thumb look at an
944.12s: Iguanodon in a museum and you will see
946.20s: that I'm right a scientist in the
948.44s: country you call United States has built
951.08s: a nearly correct skeleton of Our Kind
953.44s: some years ago but the local government
955.80s: which is partly aware of our existence
957.92s: confiscated the rec destruction as we
960.00s: live today and since thousands of years
962.28s: nearly completely beneath Earth you will
964.32s: not find any cavers or skeletons of
968.96s: us okay I got to look up a photo of an
971.64s: Iguanodon now all right
974.20s: because that's pretty cool hold on oh
977.00s: they do have
981.76s: thumbs oh that's so weird let me just
984.96s: ask chat GPT one question as well here
987.60s: so apparently scientists or
989.96s: paleontologists have had a hard time
992.04s: reconstructing certain dinosaurs because
994.76s: they say some bones are missing do they
997.80s: use uh different animal bones or even
1001.60s: make their own bones to fit the
1004.76s: skeletons yes paleontologists sometimes
1007.48s: use Bones from closely related species
1009.68s: to fill in gaps they also create
1012.32s: reconstructions or models based on a
1014.60s: fossil record and existing knowledge
1017.16s: it's a mix of scientific inference and
1019.08s: creativity to get as accurate a picture
1021.28s: as
1023.68s: possible I'm not saying I mean
1028.20s: that's what all right we're going to
1031.32s: keep going how cool would that be if
1033.24s: this is real not saying it's real but I
1035.80s: mean how cool would that be question you
1038.48s: speak sometimes about underground cities
1040.44s: in artificial sunlight do you mean
1042.52s: something like a hollow Earth with this
1044.84s: is there a second sun inside our planet
1049.12s: answer no Earth is not completely Hollow
1052.92s: and there is no second sun inside this
1055.56s: story is ridiculous and physically not
1057.28s: possible even your species should be
1058.96s: intelligent enough not to believe this
1061.76s: okay A little jab a little jab at our
1063.76s: species once again once again uh this
1067.56s: sour little reptilian is uh displaying a
1071.96s: salty Behavior towards us hominids here
1074.56s: us surface dwellers who get to bask in
1076.64s: the Sun and how amazing that's sun is
1079.60s: might I admit do you know how much mass
1082.12s: a sun must have to produce energy and
1083.96s: light for a longer Time by Fusion do you
1086.56s: really think that there could be a small
1088.16s: active sun inside this planet when I
1090.52s: talk about our Subterranean home I talk
1092.36s: about large cave systems the caves you
1094.68s: have discovered near to the surface are
1096.32s: tiny in comparison to real caves and
1098.68s: huge Caverns deeper in the earth in a
1100.64s: depth of 2,000 to 8,000 of your meters
1103.96s: but connected with many tunnels to the
1106.04s: surface or to surface near caves and we
1108.36s: live in large and advanced cities and
1110.72s: colonies inside such caves major sites
1114.00s: of us are beyond the Arctic Antarctic in
1116.76s: Asia North America and Australia if I
1119.52s: talk about artificial sunlight in our
1121.28s: cities I don't mean a real Sun but
1123.28s: various technological sources of light
1125.32s: including gravitational sources which
1127.84s: illuminates the caverns and tunnels
1130.32s: there are special cave areas and tunnels
1132.92s: with a strong UV light in every city and
1135.64s: we use that places to heat our blood
1138.80s: furthermore we also have some surface
1140.92s: Sun places in remote areas especially in
1144.08s: America and
1146.08s: Australia could you imagine just being
1149.24s: on a hike somewhere in Patagonia or in
1152.28s: like Arizona in the desert
1155.36s: somewhere and you just see like just a
1158.44s: bunch of like naked reptilians taken in
1160.56s: the
1161.76s: sun comment if that's ever happened to
1164.20s: you A lot of people watch these videos
1165.56s: you never know who's watching if any of
1167.56s: you in encountered a sunbathing
1171.92s: reptilian possibly horny question where
1175.52s: we find such a surface near entry to
1177.56s: your world ooh answer do you really
1179.76s: think I will tell you their exact
1182.32s: location if you want to find such an
1184.40s: entry you have to search it by yourself
1186.48s: but I would advise you not to do that
1189.64s: when I came to the surface 4 days ago I
1192.16s: used an entry approximately 300 of your
1195.00s: kilometers North from here near a large
1197.20s: lake but I doubt that you would be able
1198.92s: to find it there are only a few entries
1201.08s: in this part of the world more are far
1203.16s: from North and
1204.68s: East so it's kind of weird that she's
1207.44s: like you think I'll tell you that
1209.72s: information it's 300 kmers North close
1212.32s: to a lake like I mean why would you even
1214.44s: I guess maybe it's just really hidden a
1216.16s: lot of lakes as a little advice if you
1218.96s: are in a narrow cave or in a tunnel or
1221.28s: even in something that looks to you like
1223.04s: an artificial M shaft and as deeper you
1226.48s: walk as smoother appear the walls and if
1229.40s: you feel unusual warm air streaming from
1232.12s: the depth or if you hear the rushing
1234.40s: sound of streaming air in a ventilation
1236.80s: or Elevator Shaft then look for a
1239.36s: special kind of artificial and smooth
1241.24s: wall somewhere in the cave with a door
1244.08s: made of gray metal if you would be able
1246.64s: to open that door but I doubt this you
1249.44s: would be in a un in a usually round
1252.72s: technical room with ventilation systems
1255.44s: and elevators to the depth this is
1257.80s: probably an entrance to our world if you
1260.48s: have reached this point you should know
1262.12s: that we are now definitely aware of your
1264.60s: presence you are already in big trouble
1267.60s: if you have entered the round room but
1270.08s: you should look for one or two of The
1272.56s: Reptilian symbols on the
1275.24s: wall if there are no symbols or other
1278.12s: symbols you are maybe in bigger trouble
1280.72s: as you think because not every
1282.76s: underground installation belongs to Our
1285.32s: Kind some new tunnel systems are
1287.92s: operated from from alien races including
1290.68s: hostile races my general advice if you
1294.32s: find yourself in a for you strange
1296.64s: underground insulation run away as fast
1300.28s: as you can I believe that was also John
1302.72s: lear's advice uh when he spoke about the
1306.36s: aliens that is crazy I've heard stories
1309.52s: in the past of deep underground bases
1311.80s: but I've also heard stories of people
1314.28s: who traveled in these caverns and even
1317.28s: military who've
1320.36s: encountered beings just extraterrestrial
1323.56s: beings underground and like engaged in
1326.56s: combat in some way shape or form would
1329.60s: that also explain a lot of the missing
1331.60s: people you know in in in the National
1334.84s: Parks really interesting stuff to
1337.32s: contemplate but of course you know often
1341.00s: we think space is a good place to hide
1344.36s: like the backside of the moon or Mars
1346.20s: which is
1347.52s: true then we go to you know the oceans
1350.52s: obviously the oceans as well the oceans
1352.64s: I mean are at depths that we cannot
1354.52s: reach and therefore a great place to
1356.48s: hide but
1359.80s: underground you can build thousands of
1362.64s: stories
1364.52s: underground and you would not be
1367.00s: affected by earthquakes as much as the
1370.04s: surface it's a safer environment to live
1373.56s: you would probably avoid any natural
1375.92s: cataclysm or disaster forever thus your
1379.36s: species would be allowed
1381.12s: to continue existing for millions of
1383.76s: years you know so a smarter species
1387.24s: would eventually become Subterranean
1390.68s: perhaps but a happier species likes the
1393.40s: sun all right we enjoy our Sunshine
1395.92s: question you mentioned earlier that you
1397.56s: use the name lerta when you were among
1400.16s: humans and that you enjoy it to be in
1402.68s: the real sun on the surface of the Earth
1405.36s: but how can you be among humans you
1407.60s: don't look like us so anyone will see
1409.56s: that you belong to another species why
1411.92s: have nobody seen described a being like
1413.88s: you if your kind lives already since our
1416.08s: creation together with us on the same
1418.44s: planet can you explain that to
1420.68s: me answer first my kind was of course
1423.92s: seen and described and worshiped many
1426.20s: times in your primitive primitive past
1428.96s: for example in your religious writings
1431.16s: like your Christian Bible you can find
1433.72s: descriptions and even simple drawings of
1435.52s: us for also in the southern parts of
1437.40s: American continent on various temples
1440.12s: so-called wise men from India and from
1443.04s: the Asian mountains have described our
1444.88s: species many times in writings together
1447.20s: with other wise men of the African
1449.68s: continent I think we are the most
1452.00s: mentioned non-human species maybe
1454.04s: besides the Elohim in your history if
1456.64s: you don't believe me have a look at your
1458.24s: history and you will see the truth in my
1459.96s: words your great scientists called the
1463.28s: belief in Us Superstition and religion
1466.68s: and today's intelligent humans have
1468.84s: forgotten our presence on the surface in
1471.40s: the past furthermore our species is seen
1475.00s: even today sometimes from Human
1477.00s: Witnesses in its original shape on Earth
1479.96s: or in our surface near entries and
1482.20s: tunnel systems but fortunately for
1484.64s: fortunately you and your media didn't
1486.32s: take the reports of such crazies serious
1490.00s: that's good for us and that's the reason
1491.68s: why we allow those people to see us as
1493.72s: we really
1494.96s: are some of my species are also in
1497.52s: direct contact with human scientists and
1499.40s: politicians from the surface but this is
1501.40s: top secret as you would call it and
1503.32s: nobody of your public knows anything
1505.08s: about it the matter of this meetings is
1507.20s: generally the upcoming war with and
1509.80s: between the alien species and our
1512.12s: assistance in this war but there is also
1514.76s: another explanation why we can walk
1517.04s: among you and why you are not able to
1519.48s: recognize
1521.68s: us
1523.44s: mimicry the following May again sound
1525.96s: unbelievable and even shocking to you
1529.20s: but as you have asked I will explain it
1532.12s: I've told you before that we have more
1533.64s: advanced mental abilities than your
1535.64s: species and with more advanced I mean
1538.04s: that we are able to use telepathy and
1539.76s: telekinesis from our birth on in fact
1542.52s: mother and newborn child communicate
1544.72s: generally with telepathy during the
1546.36s: first months without special training as
1548.88s: you needed to activate these sleeping
1550.52s: parts of your brain the structure of our
1552.84s: brain is a little bit different to yours
1554.56s: and our hypoy is I don't hypothy Hy
1558.44s: ifies is larger and more active than
1561.44s: yours especially when we are in sunlight
1564.28s: our own abilities are very strong in
1566.04s: comparison to yours but weak in
1568.28s: comparison to the matter string SL
1570.64s: bubble mind forces of some of the alien
1573.08s: species on this planet I was never good
1576.52s: in that mind things but we all have
1578.84s: these primary abilities and can use them
1581.80s: for example for our protection or even
1584.12s: for
1585.32s: attack
1586.96s: Okay so
1589.00s: lerta here is saying that they do have
1591.28s: some capabilities that the mother and
1593.32s: child are connected telepathically and
1595.28s: communicate in this way uh for the first
1598.04s: few months which is something that we've
1600.28s: also you know been hearing about with
1602.24s: non-verbal children uh namely the
1605.00s: telepathy tapes with Kai Dixon she
1607.64s: mentions that and Dr Diane Powell they
1610.96s: both mention that these nonverbal
1613.60s: children because of their lack of
1616.20s: ability to communicate and communicate
1618.36s: ation is such a essential part of
1621.32s: survival that you will find a way to
1623.72s: communicate in order to survive and and
1626.20s: that's how they've developed their own
1628.76s: dormant sort of telepathic sense I also
1633.56s: I also enjoy the fact that lerta is like
1636.64s: we're not at the top of the food chain I
1638.76s: mean them as reptilians are not at the
1640.84s: top of the food chain um that's really
1643.32s: interesting must be a real blow to her
1645.48s: ego because she does seem a little bit
1647.48s: entitled
1649.32s: when we are on the surface and we meet
1650.96s: human beings even a large group of them
1653.44s: this makes no difference all of your
1654.96s: minds are like one mind we are able to
1657.52s: touch their mind and induce them via
1659.52s: telepathy the command see us as one of
1662.56s: your kind and the weak human mind will
1665.20s: accept this order without refusion and
1667.36s: they will see us despite our reptilian
1669.24s: look as normal humans I've done this
1671.52s: many times and you weak humans generally
1673.96s: see me as an attractive brown-haired
1675.92s: woman because I have created this
1677.64s: special mimicry image in my mind years
1680.32s: ago and I can induce it into your minds
1682.68s: without problems I've needed some time
1685.24s: at the beginning to learn the use of the
1686.76s: mimicry correctly but then it worked
1689.12s: nearly automatically and I can even walk
1691.12s: among a group of yours and nobody will
1693.12s: recognize what I am there is a simple
1695.68s: switch see us as we really are see us as
1698.84s: we want you to see us in your
1701.32s: Consciousness which was placed there
1703.16s: from the Elohim when they created your
1705.44s: kind and we can use this switch to
1707.48s: convince you that you see humans when
1709.92s: you look at us other aliens use this
1712.16s: switch too it is easier than you think
1715.64s: when there are meetings between your
1717.04s: kind and Aliens which seem to look
1719.08s: exactly like yours these aliens have
1721.72s: used that switch and some of the
1723.28s: meetings with men like aliens can be
1725.44s: also explained with meetings with my
1728.04s: kind when I met EF for the first time he
1731.32s: saw me also as a normal human woman and
1733.36s: I remember that he was very frightened
1734.88s: and shocked when I revealed to him my
1736.92s: real appearance
1739.44s: fascinating okay so much to unpack but
1742.28s: lerta did say that there were
1745.44s: humanoid aliens but now she's also
1748.52s: saying that some of the human-looking
1751.00s: aliens are actually other looking aliens
1754.28s: might not be
1755.84s: reptilian that are using this mental
1758.64s: switch to make people see them or
1760.80s: perceive them as the being wants them to
1763.40s: be
1765.04s: perceived this is really interesting
1766.80s: because when you when you you know I've
1769.04s: I've studied hypnosis for entertainment
1771.12s: purposes as a magician uh quite a bit
1774.24s: and these are things that you can
1776.08s: actually induce through
1778.28s: hypnosis hypnotic states allow you to
1781.44s: really play with the senses of the mind
1784.36s: and that includes smell it includes
1786.12s: touch it includes sight includes taste
1789.04s: it includes everything there's there's
1790.88s: studies of people who were uh fed
1794.96s: invisible
1796.16s: food and not only were they pretending
1799.04s: or thinking that they were really
1801.44s: eating they were actually having bowel
1803.76s: movements so physiologically you're even
1806.64s: able to affect the human body with
1810.44s: suggestion and so something like this
1812.56s: isn't completely impossible and much
1816.24s: more likely than my skin actually
1820.64s: shifting into you know some chameleon
1823.68s: like form and I think that this idea
1827.36s: actually has legs to stand on that could
1830.92s: work you know
1834.60s: theoretically it wouldn't work for us
1836.96s: because we would have to in you know
1838.56s: induce everyone into a hypnotic State
1841.84s: and lower their cognitive sort of
1844.60s: reflexes uh whereas because of their
1847.92s: evolution they can do that very simply
1851.16s: um without you even knowing it and
1852.88s: that's
1854.20s: interesting and the point about your
1856.96s: mind is all one mind is very interesting
1860.08s: that's something that I think we're just
1861.52s: starting to scratch the surface on with
1864.32s: this whole idea well it's a philosophy
1866.56s: that has been echoed for a very long
1868.92s: time if you look at hermeticism or
1870.56s: Rosicrucianism the sort of As Above So
1873.16s: Below um this idea that everything is
1875.92s: one and everything is connected is very
1877.72s: old but since the introduction of modern
1880.16s: science you know we've really strayed
1882.40s: from that theory thinking that that was
1884.72s: more of like a philosophical maybe even
1888.24s: spiritual belief but now with quantum
1890.36s: physics I think we're realizing that
1892.36s: this might actually be the case that
1893.96s: this field exists and that we're all
1895.88s: sort of a part of it I digress question
1898.56s: do you mean that you can really make me
1900.24s: believe that I talk now with an
1902.08s: attractive brown-haired woman instead of
1904.20s: a reptilian being like you answer
1907.60s: probably but I don't think so in your
1909.40s: special case when someone expects to see
1911.64s: a human woman instead of me I can do it
1913.96s: without problems with his mind even with
1915.80s: large groups because nobody expects to
1917.52s: see reptile woman but I've allowed your
1920.00s: mind to see me in my original appearance
1922.12s: from our first meeting on and I have
1924.32s: never induced something into your mind
1926.60s: so You' have already realized that I not
1928.44s: human if I now try to change this it
1931.20s: would probably lead to an absolute
1933.00s: confusion or to unconsciousness and I
1936.64s: don't want to harm you as I've said I'm
1938.96s: not very good at these things that's
1941.20s: super interesting too it's almost like
1943.04s: um what was that movie where the where
1945.64s: the guy had like these special glasses
1948.44s: in the 80s and he could see everything
1950.68s: for what it truly was it's kind of like
1953.84s: that it's kind of like once you see it
1955.28s: you can't un seee it that's kind of cool
1957.08s: question that's very scary can you kill
1959.60s: with that ability answer yes but it's
1961.88s: forbidden this means not that it was not
1964.24s: done in previous times question have
1967.80s: both sexes this ability answer yes
1971.68s: that's a sexist
1974.76s: question he's clapping back you know he
1977.04s: felt a little slided with her
1978.64s: condescension so he's like what about
1981.76s: women uh question what about photos how
1984.44s: do you appear on photos I'm going to
1986.80s: guess that they just appear like
1988.60s: reptilians answer this is a silly
1990.64s: question I appear on photos as a reptile
1992.56s: being because I can't have influence on
1994.72s: the photo or on the camera itself but
1996.40s: only on the pH photographer's mind if he
1998.92s: or she would develop the film and show
2000.56s: the photo to others they would see me in
2002.24s: my original shape that's the reason why
2004.16s: it's forbidden for our kind to be filmed
2005.88s: or photographed and we must avoid every
2008.04s: camera on the surface that is very
2010.32s: difficult uh and we were filmed
2012.36s: sometimes in the past without our
2013.52s: knowledge especially from certain of
2015.52s: your governments and secret
2017.40s: agencies I would love to see those films
2020.56s: also on a little side note that lady
2023.40s: screaming in the airplane suddenly isn't
2025.88s: so insane you know you consider you know
2030.04s: uh the fact that she might have
2032.32s: inadvertently seen one of these beings
2034.88s: for what they really are be it reptilian
2036.60s: or not but using her words that mother
2040.96s: back there is not real I would have
2043.56s: loved to be on that flight by the way
2045.64s: that would have been a cool flight to be
2046.84s: on probably not probably been a
2048.72s: stressful flight after she said that she
2050.96s: said something about the plane going
2052.16s: down and something else I would not like
2053.64s: to be on that flight I would have
2054.80s: probably you know what I would have
2055.76s: probably got off with her like this
2057.80s: lady's right he isn't real I'm out of
2059.32s: here question what other commands can
2061.04s: your kind induce into our minds
2062.68s: something like serve us or obey answer
2065.64s: this is again a strange question we are
2067.48s: not your enemy most of us not so why
2069.76s: should we do this to answer your
2071.64s: question it depends on the strength of
2073.04s: the human mind and on the strength of
2074.68s: the sending reptilian there is no serve
2077.40s: us or serve me switch in your mind so
2080.00s: such a command is much more difficult to
2081.72s: induce if the human mind and
2083.56s: Consciousness is weak and The Reptilian
2085.28s: inducer is experiencing these things and
2087.88s: was some hours in the sun before he or
2090.12s: she tries to do it then it could
2091.52s: probably work for a certain time there
2093.92s: are secret teachings about such things
2095.76s: but I've never learned anything about it
2097.76s: I use my primary abilities for mimicry
2099.84s: and for communication with my own kind
2101.76s: and sometimes for other private things
2103.84s: but I've never used them to harm humans
2105.96s: or their mind I would appreciate it if
2108.56s: we can end with this topic here I think
2110.76s: she's annoyed at the fact that the
2112.44s: person asking questions is making her
2114.40s: out to be some type of monstrous being
2117.36s: who has you know this murderous intent
2120.32s: but in fact she's just kind of annoyed
2123.00s: at that like no we're not if I wanted to
2125.00s: kill you I'd do it already you'd be dead
2126.60s: I'd eat you I'd eat your flesh but
2129.04s: that's not the case also the switch idea
2131.08s: is very cool because there are many
2133.20s: abduction cases and many cases of alien
2136.72s: encounters you know if you look at the
2138.52s: case of Travis
2139.84s: Walton where these grayish aliens or the
2143.48s: ones that sort of there might not have
2145.60s: been gray aliens but something similar
2147.48s: to the gray aliens were performing a
2149.60s: procedure on Travis when he awoke during
2151.96s: his
2152.76s: abduction he then fought them off walked
2155.56s: into a different room and countered
2158.32s: these Nordic like beings or these tall
2160.92s: hominids that were kind of
2163.56s: jacked they didn't speak however and
2166.40s: they were wearing like fishbowls over
2168.00s: their head almost silly almost like a
2169.92s: silly interpretation of a human makes
2172.80s: you think that what if those gray
2176.84s: extraterrestrials noticing Travis's
2179.72s: demeanor and and his Panic you know his
2182.32s: panicked State decided we should
2185.32s: probably give him something
2188.08s: a little bit more little less alarming
2190.04s: to look
2191.00s: at and then turn that switch on maybe
2195.08s: that was the case very interesting to
2196.68s: think about I've always thought I've
2198.04s: always thought about you know are the
2200.72s: were the Grays working for for these
2202.84s: Nordic looking folk or were they both
2205.24s: working for you know something else
2206.88s: behind the curtain or yeah is it just
2209.48s: the Grays or whatever
2212.16s: entity playing with their minds question
2214.76s: a last question you've said earlier that
2216.60s: you can hide your UFOs do you use the
2219.08s: same ability to do this answer yes but
2222.32s: on a technical base there's a powerful
2224.68s: device inside each craft which is able
2226.44s: to send an artificial signal to your
2228.52s: minds to convince you that you either
2230.92s: see nothing but only the sky or that you
2233.96s: see normal aircraft like planes instead
2235.96s: of our ships this isn't used very often
2239.00s: because we avoid human public uh when we
2241.24s: move in the atmosphere if you are able
2243.28s: to see our UFOs it means that the device
2245.60s: is either defective or DEA activated for
2248.08s: some reason the camouflage effect didn't
2250.12s: work on photos to answer this possible
2253.00s: question of you already in advance but
2256.24s: why should someone make a photo of the
2258.64s: sky if he could not see anything unusual
2261.64s: there by the way most of the surface
2264.12s: entry points near to our tunnels are
2266.32s: also hidden with such a device and your
2268.44s: kind will generally see only normal cave
2270.60s: walls instead of the door that is one
2273.36s: reason why I've said that I doubt that
2275.56s: you will be able to find such a secret
2277.12s: door to our world but it has happened a
2279.52s: few times in the past what has happened
2281.84s: to those people man that's interesting a
2285.28s: device that sends a signal to your mind
2288.80s: again this type of Technology seems way
2292.12s: more feasible to me than actual
2294.52s: cloaking you know or rendering something
2297.12s: invisible it seems like well I mean
2299.44s: maybe there is some technology that
2300.88s: could that could do that uh in a way but
2303.52s: I definitely think that our mind is the
2306.76s: weakest link
2308.76s: because our perception if you can
2311.24s: manipulate that you can manipulate
2313.00s: anything you don't need actual light
2315.84s: bending technology you just need
2317.72s: something that alters your perception
2319.64s: it's an interesting form of tech that I
2321.76s: I haven't given too much thought on
2323.32s: question back to you in your own history
2325.24s: you've mentioned the race of the Elohim
2327.20s: who have created our race our human race
2330.68s: from where did they come and how did
2332.16s: they look like what exactly happened
2334.04s: when they arrive are they our God answer
2338.80s: the Elohim came from this universe from
2341.04s: the solar system you call Al debron in
2343.92s: your Maps they were a very tall humanoid
2346.76s: species with usually blonde hairs and
2349.40s: very white skin they avoided the
2351.36s: sunlight because it hurt their skin and
2353.12s: eyes this was absolutely unbelievable
2355.68s: for a sun-loving species like us they
2358.24s: seem to be intelligent and peaceful at
2360.16s: the beginning and we started a more or
2362.48s: less friendly communication with them
2363.96s: but later they showed their real
2365.16s: intentions and plans they wanted to
2367.60s: evolve the Apes to a New Breed and we
2369.52s: were a disturbing factor for them on
2371.72s: their new Zoo Planet at first they
2374.04s: caught around 10,000 or maybe even
2376.28s: 20,000 of your Simeon ancestors and they
2379.04s: left the planet for some hundred years
2381.52s: when they returned they brought your now
2384.16s: more human ancestors back when they left
2387.56s: Earth again for some thousands of years
2390.24s: and the Primitive preh humans live
2392.00s: together with us without major problems
2394.24s: they were just afraid of our aircraft
2395.56s: and Technology the Elohim
2398.04s: had taught their mind and enhanced their
2399.84s: brain and their body structure and they
2402.24s: were able now to use tools and fire the
2405.36s: Elohim returned within 23,000 years
2407.84s: seven times and accelerated the
2410.08s: evolution speed of certain of your kind
2412.88s: you must understand that you were not
2414.60s: the first human civilization on the
2416.48s: planet the first Advanced humans who
2418.96s: lived at the same time with less
2420.16s: developed preum because the Elohim had
2422.44s: experimented with different speeds and
2424.00s: stages of evolution with technology and
2426.80s: speech existed around 700,000 years ago
2429.80s: on this planet your scientists have not
2431.68s: understood this because they found only
2433.80s: the bones of preh humans and some
2436.00s: primitive cave drawings showing Advanced
2438.08s: humans and flying
2440.04s: devices this genetically Advanced human
2442.40s: breed lived together with us they
2444.28s: avoided contact with my kind because the
2446.44s: Elohim teachers had warned them with
2449.08s: misleading purpose that we are evil
2451.72s: beings and that we lie to
2455.76s: them this is all extremely interesting
2458.64s: one thing that I like to uh think about
2460.56s: as well is let's say you
2463.56s: were genetically engineering a species
2466.92s: on a planet all right bit of a thought
2469.60s: experiment here
2471.48s: obviously if you can Bounce Around the
2473.92s: universe you would notice very quickly
2476.60s: that there is an abundant amount of
2478.16s: exoplanets that there are probably
2481.08s: billions of planets exactly like ours
2483.28s: that are capable of sustaining Simeon
2485.72s: life or any type of life it would be
2489.32s: very strange to only do one of these
2491.60s: experiments on one planet if you have
2493.56s: that type of Technology you would be
2494.92s: doing this on potentially hundreds of
2497.52s: thousands of planets at the same time if
2499.72s: you did this and created these little
2502.60s: zoos where you can populate them with
2505.04s: you know different species from other
2506.88s: planets bring them here bring that
2508.60s: species alter it genetically so that you
2511.36s: know the carbon dioxide levels here
2513.04s: don't destroy it and the radiation is
2514.72s: just right and the gravity and
2515.84s: everything else and put them here and
2517.44s: you can start populating all these
2519.28s: planets kind of like zoos which you know
2521.72s: would make sense why we have octopus
2524.00s: because what a bizarre looking species
2526.96s: but we also have birds and we also have
2529.20s: you know Venus fly traps and and all
2531.56s: these other strange things the cool
2533.48s: thing about all this is that as
2535.00s: mentioned they came back every what
2537.44s: 27,000 years or whatever to bring the
2540.32s: ancestors or to to they came back seven
2543.52s: times during 27,000 years with space
2548.40s: travel and that type of
2551.40s: Technology if I didn't have a home
2553.72s: planet let's say I lived in my spaceship
2558.24s: okay time is definitely relative the way
2562.20s: that people experience time here is
2565.88s: different than if I was living on a
2569.64s: surface that had more gravity right
2571.96s: hypothetically
2573.80s: so if my ship could like an
2578.60s: Interstellar Park itself next to a black
2581.32s: hole for several hours I could then hop
2585.96s: back and although it was only several
2588.68s: hours it might have been thousands of
2590.20s: years for the things on the planet so
2594.36s: this Evolution can actually be
2599.00s: achieved technically from the
2602.72s: Extraterrestrial
2605.20s: standpoint perhaps within days
2607.80s: think about it if they have no home
2609.08s: planet they can just dip beside a black
2611.44s: hole and watch the evolution happen
2615.84s: within days which might also account for
2618.64s: the fact that they don't really care
2620.84s: about us you know if you think of these
2622.80s: abductions and how they sort of
2624.00s: manhandle our species without any regard
2626.88s: and say it's for the greater good they
2628.36s: just don't care they do the thing they
2630.68s: hop back and then they come back and do
2632.48s: the thing to your ancestors interesting
2634.64s: interesting to think about well after
2636.48s: some century the aliens decided to
2638.60s: extinct their first creation and they
2640.28s: accelerated the evolution of a second
2641.92s: and better test series and so on and so
2644.80s: on the truth is that your modern human
2647.24s: civilization is not the first on this
2648.92s: planet Earth but already the seventh the
2651.52s: buildings of the first breeds are lost
2653.32s: but the fifth civilization was the one
2655.84s: which built with large triangular
2658.00s: constructions you call Egyptian Pyramids
2661.24s: today around 75,000 years ago your
2664.08s: Egyptians just found that large ancient
2665.92s: pyramids in the sand and tried not very
2668.08s: successful to build similar
2669.64s: constructions and the six civilization
2671.88s: was the one which built the cities which
2673.76s: ruins you can find today Beneath the Sea
2676.08s: in the so-called bimy area around 16,000
2679.04s: years ago the last creation of the
2681.24s: seventh breed of your series was done
2682.92s: just 8,500 years ago and this is the
2686.04s: only creation you can remember and to
2688.20s: which your religious writings refer you
2690.60s: rely on archaeological and paleont
2693.36s: paleontological artifacts which show you
2695.84s: a wrong and short path
2697.72s: but how should you know anything about
2699.60s: the six civilizations before and if you
2702.64s: find evidence of their existence you
2704.32s: deny and misinterpret the facts this is
2707.04s: partly a programming of your mind and
2708.96s: partly pure
2710.84s: ignorance I will tell you in the
2712.68s: following only about your Creations
2715.04s: because the six previous mankinds are
2716.92s: lost and therefore they should not
2718.96s: concern you interesting the idea with
2721.36s: the Egyptians and that's something I
2722.92s: think that a lot of modern sort of more
2726.08s: Fringe archae ol ologists such as um you
2729.48s: know Graham Hancock and others have
2731.40s: suggested and Randall Carlson that we
2734.96s: might have only stumbled on ruins and
2737.08s: built upon those ruins and that's
2738.52s: something that we know that we do
2739.88s: already so you know might account for
2742.24s: the erosion on the Sphinx and so on and
2744.04s: so forth interesting again if AAR
2746.92s: they're just borrowing from things that
2749.12s: are kind of
2751.24s: already being talked about there was a
2754.08s: large war between us and the Elohim and
2756.36s: also between certain groups of Elohim
2758.40s: themselves because many of them were the
2760.44s: opinion that the again and again
2762.84s: creation of human species on this planet
2764.60s: makes no real sense the last battles in
2766.96s: this war were fought around 5,000 years
2768.96s: ago in orbit and surface the aliens used
2771.96s: powerful Sonic weapons to destroy our
2774.16s: underground cities but on the other hand
2776.64s: we were able to destroy many of their
2778.52s: surface installations and bases in Space
2782.16s: the humans of your series were very
2784.68s: frightened when they observed our
2786.16s: battles and and they wrote it down in
2787.80s: the form of religious myths their mind
2790.24s: was not able to understand what was
2791.76s: really going on the Elohim who appeared
2795.08s: as gods for the sixth and seventh breed
2797.88s: told them that this is a war between
2799.44s: good and evil and that they are good and
2801.84s: that we are evil the evil race this
2805.28s: depends certainly on the point of view
2807.96s: it was our planet before they arrived
2810.28s: and before they started their evolution
2812.16s: project with your kind in my opinion it
2814.32s: was our right to fight for our planet it
2816.64s: would it was exactly 40
2819.40s: 4,943 years ago according to your time
2822.04s: scale that the Elohim left the planet
2824.96s: again for unknown reasons this is a very
2827.24s: important date for us because many of
2828.68s: our historians called it a victory fact
2831.56s: is that we don't know what really
2835.48s: happened I
2838.40s: mean I am more and
2841.16s: more on lta's
2844.36s: side she's convincing me that
2848.16s: yeah this is their plan like that's
2851.88s: wild I gave this example last time you
2854.24s: know if my coffee started talking to me
2855.64s: I'd start believing it because it's just
2857.44s: absolutely blowing my mind and giving me
2859.72s: a new you know perspective on
2861.88s: reality much is the same if you know
2864.68s: even now but especially thousands of
2867.28s: years ago if something came down from
2869.72s: the heavens burning with this fire this
2872.96s: light that is unexplainable and spoke in
2875.84s: our minds and told us that it was good
2878.76s: and the other things were
2880.76s: evil you will believe this there's no if
2885.16s: ends or buts about it any one ancient
2889.56s: conspiracy
2891.08s: theorist would instantly be publicly
2895.36s: executed for speaking against such
2898.92s: Gods that's the truth that is exactly
2901.48s: what would happen if you gave me a time
2904.44s: machine and I popped back to you know a
2907.40s: few thousand years ago and had a
2908.92s: flashlight with me and harness the power
2912.08s: of the Sun in my hand I would be a
2915.36s: demigod so rest assured that the
2917.44s: technology that is absolutely baffling
2919.36s: to
2920.36s: us intelligent species today are
2923.60s: technologically advanced species that
2925.92s: technology thousands of years ago would
2927.84s: have just been absolutely Paradigm
2929.36s: shifting for for uh any anybody
2931.64s: witnessing it and you could get away
2934.08s: with telling them anything and telling
2936.24s: them good need just very simple we're
2938.52s: good they're bad chill out we got
2942.08s: this and then they left the Elohim were
2945.36s: gone from one day to another they
2947.60s: vanished Without a Trace together with
2949.16s: their ships and we found most of their
2950.72s: surface installations destroyed by them
2953.64s: the humans were on their own and your
2955.96s: civilization developed many of us were
2957.88s: in contact with certain More Southern
2959.88s: tribes of your species in the coming
2961.80s: centuries and we were able to convince
2963.44s: some of them we are not the evil the
2965.12s: aliens wanted them to believe during the
2967.48s: time from 4,900 years ago to today many
2970.00s: other alien species arrived on the
2971.60s: planet some of them used the old
2973.28s: teaching and programming of your mind
2975.12s: and played again God for you but the
2978.80s: Elohim themselves never came back they
2981.76s: had left the planet for a duration of
2983.44s: some thousands years Also earlier so we
2986.52s: expect their return one day in the
2988.04s: future to end their project or to maybe
2992.08s: extinct also the seventh
2994.52s: breed but we don't really know what has
2996.96s: happened to them to answer this question
2998.96s: of you in advance could this be the
3001.44s: famous 2027 date are the
3004.52s: Elohim just a variant of the three body
3008.88s: problem that is going to come back here
3010.64s: one day very interesting to think about
3012.88s: your current civilization doesn't know
3014.76s: anything about your real origin about
3016.44s: your real past about your real world and
3018.52s: universe and you know very little about
3020.40s: us in our past and you know nothing
3022.88s: about the things to come in the near
3024.88s: future as long as you will not
3027.04s: understand and believe my words I tell
3029.20s: you the truth because because we are not
3030.96s: your enemy as long as there is danger
3034.04s: for your species your enemies are
3036.84s: already here and you have not understood
3039.40s: open your eyes or you will be in big
3041.44s: trouble soon if you haven't believed
3043.92s: anything of the things I've told you
3045.32s: before then you should really believe
3047.16s: and remember
3049.28s: this
3051.36s: question why do you think I don't
3053.52s: believe you answer I have certain
3055.72s: feeling that you don't believe me
3057.00s: despite the fact that I'm sitting here
3058.24s: in front of you everything I've told you
3059.72s: in the last two hours is the absolute
3061.44s: truth about our
3063.40s: world I like how she says our
3067.48s: world because I don't think she means
3070.24s: our world as in her and the reptilians
3073.32s: but as in US humans and them the
3076.60s: reptilians that even though we
3079.20s: were genetically
3081.40s: engineered and put here they're still
3084.32s: willing to share this place with us
3087.76s: that's kind of cool that's kind of
3089.68s: benevolent that's a wild to think that
3093.92s: the benevolent species are the
3095.76s: underground disgusting lizard looking
3098.44s: like
3099.56s: people and that the ones that look like
3101.84s: us that descend from the sky and that
3103.64s: look like angels are the evil ones very
3106.88s: interesting turn of events here it's
3109.12s: crazy that
3110.80s: like humanity is a scop when you think
3113.96s: about it everything even if this you
3115.88s: know is or isn't true all the teachings
3118.72s: and the history books and everything
3120.60s: that we've ever read about us is all
3123.12s: from one
3125.04s: perspective we rarely get the other side
3128.44s: and so it's very easy to manipulate our
3131.64s: species and if you think otherwise then
3135.40s: you are the person who is the easiest to
3138.32s: manipulate question how many alien
3140.56s: species are active on Earth at the
3142.08s: moment answer as far as we know 14
3144.48s: species 11 from this universe two from
3147.20s: another bubble and one very Advanced
3149.80s: from a very different
3152.68s: plane don't ask me for names because
3155.32s: nearly all are not pronounceable for you
3157.48s: eight of them are not pronounceable even
3159.12s: for us most of the species especially
3161.84s: the more advanced are just studying you
3163.92s: as animals and they are not very
3165.20s: dangerous for you and for us and we work
3167.60s: together with some of them but three
3169.16s: species are hostile including the one
3171.56s: which you which was in contact with some
3173.36s: of your governments and exchanged their
3174.84s: technology for copper and important
3177.12s: things and which had betrayed your kind
3180.28s: there was and is a cold war between two
3183.16s: of these hostile races during the last
3185.16s: 73 years and the third species seemed to
3188.00s: be the quote unquote winner in this
3190.04s: useless struggle we expect a hot War a
3193.80s: more hot war between them and you in the
3196.64s: near future I would say within the next
3198.88s: 10 or 20 years well that time is
3203.00s: thankfully expired and we are not
3204.72s: worried about that development in the
3207.20s: last time there were some rumors about a
3210.52s: new 15th species which had arrived on
3212.96s: Earth just three or four years ago but
3214.48s: we don't know anything about their
3215.56s: intentions and we were not in contact
3217.40s: with them until now maybe the rumors are
3219.56s: wrong okay I mean them saying there's
3221.84s: only 14 is interesting because I think
3224.60s: Greer mentioned recently there were 69
3227.64s: Dr Steph Greer mentioned there were 69
3229.68s: which I think
3233.00s: is I
3235.44s: mean do they speak 420 languages also um
3239.92s: but then also I think the former Defense
3242.56s: Minister uh Paul helier of Canada uh
3245.76s: also mentioned over 60 species and so
3249.40s: where are they getting those numbers
3250.72s: from I don't know not from lerta
3253.40s: question what do the Hostile alien races
3255.60s: want answer various raw materials
3257.76s: including copper for their technology
3259.84s: your water or better the hydrogen in
3262.32s: your water which is a source of energy
3263.84s: for advanced Fusion processes
3266.52s: and certain chemical elements in your
3268.72s: air that's interesting because that now
3271.24s: is something that I buy when we talk
3272.68s: about Fusion earlier I had a lot of
3275.28s: comments from physicists saying that you
3278.28s: can't get aridium from that type of
3281.72s: fusion um it's just not possible the
3285.16s: hydrogen in the water makes a lot of
3286.88s: sense because hydrogen if you can
3288.84s: harness that energy then you potentially
3292.20s: could have like a limitless amount of
3293.76s: energy with our oceans and this could be
3296.00s: a Giant gas station you know
3297.84s: intergalactically furthermore two of
3299.76s: your species are also interested in your
3301.72s: body in your human tissue and blood
3304.04s: because their own genetic structure is
3305.76s: defective through bad Evolution and
3307.36s: radiation as far as we know and they
3309.44s: need intact strings from your kind and
3311.76s: from animals to repair their own genetic
3314.04s: again and again but they are not really
3316.08s: able to repair the defects completely
3317.84s: because their DNA and your DNA is not
3319.76s: fully compatible my own species is
3322.08s: absolutely incompatible incompatible
3324.28s: with them so they are not very
3325.60s: interested in us and they try to make
3327.52s: more compatible cross breeds between you
3330.04s: and them by use of an artificial
3331.84s: fertilizations and artificial WBS we
3334.36s: suppose that the coming war between
3335.88s: three races or between you and one or
3338.56s: all of them will be fought for raw
3340.20s: material hydrogen air and
3342.84s: DNA hybridization is very interesting to
3345.84s: me and all of these theories have
3349.16s: been um voiced by a lot of people
3352.96s: looking into the you know abductions and
3355.24s: hybridization program that have
3356.96s: allegedly been going on question is
3359.12s: there a reason for the abductions answer
3361.36s: partly especially when the aliens took
3363.12s: egg and sperm Sam samples from you
3366.08s: sometimes the abductors belong to
3367.44s: another and more advanced race and they
3369.48s: just want to study your body and your
3371.24s: mind which is more interesting for some
3373.56s: of them than your solid body as you
3376.24s: would study A Primitive animal as I've
3378.88s: said three alien species are hostile and
3381.64s: this means they do not care for your
3383.52s: fate or for your life and people who
3385.60s: were abducted Ed by them came very
3388.48s: rarely back alive if someone is able to
3391.20s: report about an abduction it it means in
3393.60s: my opinion that he or she has not met
3395.88s: one of the aggressive species and that
3397.92s: he or she is a very very lucky human to
3400.56s: be alive Advanced and friendly races
3403.44s: also took sometimes eggs and sperm
3405.36s: samples but for other reasons yeah I
3408.36s: suppose if you were abducted and never
3410.56s: returned we just wouldn't hear about the
3412.16s: abduction right question you've said
3414.08s: that there are only 14 species active on
3416.00s: Earth but why describe people who saw
3417.92s: alien beings so many different and
3420.08s: bizarre types of them yes thank you
3422.36s: great question love this question answer
3425.36s: I think I've already answered this
3426.64s: question and as I've said most of the
3428.56s: alien races have much more advanced mind
3430.60s: abilities than you or me even there is
3432.92s: just one alien race completely without
3434.84s: such abilities they are able to appear
3437.16s: in your mind and memory as whatever they
3439.68s: want and this induced image has nothing
3442.92s: to do with their real appearance you
3444.40s: remember them as normal humans or great
3446.36s: dwarfs or even extremely bizarre animals
3449.48s: because they want you to remember that
3451.68s: or sometimes they want you to completely
3453.48s: forget anything about meeting with them
3455.92s: another
3456.84s: example you can for example remember
3459.28s: that you were just in a normal of your
3461.64s: human hospitals and that some doctors
3463.80s: were examining you and you think not
3466.76s: further about what has happened to you
3469.12s: maybe until you discover that there is
3470.68s: no hospital in the street where you
3472.08s: supposed it but in fact you were
3474.16s: examined by them in one of their
3476.92s: Laboratories you can't rely on your mind
3479.24s: in this case they appear in different
3481.04s: shapes to you to confuse you and to make
3483.52s: so-called abduction Witnesses who were
3485.56s: able to remember the events or who
3487.56s: believe they are able to remember
3489.52s: ridiculous in the public and as far as
3491.60s: we know they are successful
3494.16s: okay saying you know something along the
3496.60s: lines of of uh making us seem crazy and
3499.04s: that's part of like their sop I guess
3501.32s: also you know there's that scene in
3503.68s: Jupiter Rising no Jupiter Rising I
3506.40s: chanting Tatum milakunis she goes to get
3509.00s: this procedure done in a hospital and
3511.40s: turns out it's all these aliens acting
3513.08s: as doctors believe me there are only 14
3515.72s: alien species on this planet and only
3517.56s: eight of them abduct humans at the
3519.16s: moment as far as we know in addition not
3521.44s: every one of your abductees is one is
3524.56s: one and some of the aliens in their
3526.84s: reports are really just imagination or
3529.28s: lies okay I mean that goes to that
3531.48s: saying answer oh I think they got these
3533.36s: backwards question how can we protect us
3536.88s: against this influence on our
3539.88s: mind answer I don't know I doubt you can
3543.72s: because your mind is like an open book
3545.08s: to read and write for nearly every
3546.72s: species I know this is partly the guilty
3550.48s: of the Elohim themselves because they
3552.84s: had constructed or better misconstructed
3555.76s: partly intentionally your mind and your
3558.08s: Consciousness without real protection
3559.84s: mechanisms if you are aware that someone
3562.24s: tries to manipulate your mind you can
3564.04s: only concentrate on that suspicion and
3566.44s: try to analyze every of your thoughts
3569.04s: and memories very important Don't Close
3571.36s: Your Eyes this would lead to different
3573.40s: form of brain waves which are more easy
3575.64s: to access and don't sit or lay down to
3578.52s: rest if you stay awake during first
3580.28s: minutes you can try maybe to filter the
3582.48s: other thoughts and waves in your brain
3584.56s: and the inducer will give up after some
3586.52s: minutes if he or she is not successful
3588.96s: because it will start to hurt his or her
3590.72s: own brain this is a very difficult and
3593.40s: certainly painful and it can harm you so
3595.64s: better don't don't try to resist but it
3597.88s: would be the only possibility you have
3600.16s: however you can try this only with more
3602.24s: weaker species not with the strong ones
3605.92s: all right so they're
3607.28s: saying tin foil hats won't work is
3610.84s: apparently uh what we've agreed upon po
3613.72s: uh countered to popular
3615.40s: belief question what do you mean with
3618.76s: one species comes from a very different
3620.64s: plane H answer before I can explain that
3623.64s: correctly to you you must be able to
3625.24s: understand the universe and this would
3626.76s: mean maybe a useless teaching of your
3628.84s: mind including the remove of some
3631.40s: barriers of many weeks and with teaching
3634.24s: I not only not only teaching by
3638.08s: words I have said this with your word
3641.60s: plain or level because you have again no
3645.32s: better word in your vocabulary and
3647.00s: dimension would be in this case
3648.72s: absolutely wrong it's rather wrong even
3651.32s: for another bubble because a dimension
3654.28s: can't exist without planes
3656.72s: if you would be a species living in
3658.16s: another or over the plane and if you
3660.84s: would be furthermore able to enter
3662.84s: planes without technology so that your
3664.72s: body is not made of that kind of matter
3667.08s: you know then you would be the mightiest
3669.96s: being you can imagine this very Advanced
3672.24s: race I've mentioned had developed
3674.32s: outside of here and they've evolved in
3677.04s: fact over billions of years they would
3679.64s: be able to destroy all of you and all of
3681.88s: us and everything with with just a
3684.08s: single thought we were in contact with
3686.64s: them only three times in our whole
3688.44s: history because their interest in your
3690.64s: planet is different from that of all
3692.36s: other races they are definitely no
3694.88s: danger for you or us
3698.00s: whoa so those are like
3700.48s: Gods these beings are like yeah plane
3705.28s: Walkers very cool question what will
3708.44s: happen when the war begins answer this
3711.44s: is difficult to answer it depends on the
3713.32s: enemy race and on their tactics War is
3716.04s: not always that primitive thing you
3717.52s: humans mean with the word War can be
3719.68s: fought on various levels one possibility
3722.32s: they have is the destruction of your
3723.88s: social system by influence on political
3725.68s: leaders another is the use of advanced
3727.76s: weapon systems which can cause
3729.08s: earthquakes or volcanic eruptions or
3731.08s: other disasters including weather
3733.56s: disasters which may seem natural to you
3736.92s: the special fields from copper Fusion
3739.24s: I've mentioned earlier are able to have
3740.84s: an influence on your global weather I
3743.52s: think they will not attack the planet
3745.08s: directly before the human civilization
3747.00s: is weak because even if you have
3749.28s: possibilities to destroy their craft but
3751.20s: not many let me say that we are not
3754.00s: absolutely sure if there will be really
3756.16s: such a hot War already in the next years
3758.48s: I don't want to talk further about this
3760.68s: and there's a reason why I posted the
3764.88s: interview I did with hakeim Isler last
3768.24s: week him being a scop expert he
3772.56s: said something that really sort of
3774.80s: resonated with me if if you know you
3776.92s: want to win a
3778.20s: war the mightiest weapon isn't artillery
3783.44s: isn't munition or guns or bombs it's
3786.76s: influencing the
3788.52s: people to pull the trigger or to
3793.12s: retreat that is way stronger you know if
3797.20s: you think of a false flag attack on your
3799.12s: own country for example which was done
3802.64s: in the second world war by the way you
3804.80s: attack your own country blame the enemy
3806.84s: this increases the amount of patriotism
3809.20s: it increases the amount of enlisting
3810.72s: into the army which Alters the mind of
3814.24s: the
3815.00s: people who you know are fighting
3818.40s: question this is the end of the
3820.04s: interview do you want to say a last
3822.04s: sentence or message answer open your
3825.92s: eyes and see don't believe only in your
3828.76s: wrong history or your scientists or your
3832.40s: politicians some of them know the truth
3834.52s: about various things but they don't
3836.32s: inform the public to avoid confusion and
3838.48s: panic I think your species is not as bad
3841.20s: as some of my kind think and it would be
3843.96s: a Pity to observe your end that's
3846.60s: everything I can say go through your
3848.60s: world with open eyes and you will see or
3850.68s: maybe not your kind is
3854.08s: ignorant question do you think anyone
3856.16s: will believe that this interview is the
3858.32s: truth answer no but it is an interesting
3863.08s: experiment for my social studies we you
3865.76s: will meet again in some months and you
3868.44s: will tell me then what have happened
3870.24s: after the publication of my message
3872.92s: maybe there is hope from your
3876.60s: kind that is the end of L certif file
3880.48s: number
3884.52s: one lot to chew on I actually
3888.16s: appreciated this read through much more
3891.04s: than the first one I think it's funny
3893.12s: because in the first one we went from
3895.36s: really feeling as though lerta and her
3899.04s: kind was resentful towards us being
3901.56s: almost like almost like you know Mommy's
3904.64s: little favorite
3906.72s: child and they're kind of like you don't
3909.60s: get it I was here before you you're just
3911.48s: like the newborn now it's shifted to
3914.20s: more of like she's
3916.68s: demonstrated tolerance for us in our
3920.08s: ignorance and shown patience even
3923.32s: though we seem to be so wrongfully
3927.48s: guided and she's actually trying to
3929.76s: alert us about the alarming nature of
3933.40s: reality and the all sorts of potentially
3937.20s: dangerous interactions that are
3938.36s: happening on this planet with the
3939.44s: various species and kind of like
3941.68s: forewarning us about that so very
3943.48s: interesting am I closer to believing it
3945.80s: than I was I would say so I would say
3948.40s: I'm closer to believing it that doesn't
3949.88s: you know it doesn't mean I believe it
3952.20s: but this definitely in terms of
3956.40s: The Reptilian
3958.48s: scale pun
3961.00s: intended moves the needle in the
3964.12s: direction of belief a little bit
3967.12s: more uh because again when you look at
3969.28s: things like this you really have to
3971.48s: ponder if this is a scop right if this
3975.00s: isn't just simply a lar like for
3977.08s: someone's creative expression if this
3979.60s: has a
3980.64s: purpose and if it reaches the
3984.08s: masses you might be able to sway public
3987.32s: opinion using something like this
3990.00s: creating a fantastic story about
3992.76s: reptilians that live
3995.32s: underground might make you believe that
3997.60s: this is complete BS but by doing so you
4001.96s: inherently also attach the idea of there
4005.28s: being some type of subterranean
4007.96s: civilization so the next time someone
4009.96s: brings up underground cave systems and
4012.12s: tunnels with beings you might think to
4014.96s: say oh like the lizard people make fun
4018.28s: of it and completely ignore it so it's
4021.48s: in terms of a
4023.08s: scop throwing
4025.48s: in factual things into a story like this
4029.68s: will undoubtedly make you
4031.88s: also throw the baby out with the bath
4034.24s: water so go into something like this
4037.76s: knowing that cuz I think it's healthy
4041.04s: not to say that all of this is true but
4043.72s: to say that perhaps some of this might
4047.12s: be where they hide the
4050.80s: truth folks I want to thank you guys for
4052.96s: tuning in once again I would love to
4056.52s: know if you guys want me to read through
4058.72s: part two so the second ler aile where
4062.28s: they met in
4063.56s: April um if this reaches its intended
4066.52s: audience then I will do so if not we
4069.08s: will move on to something else you guys
4071.40s: have been very vocal on the first one if
4074.28s: that is still the case let me know in
4076.08s: the comments share this video with your
4078.12s: friends do all that great stuff head on
4080.68s: over to area 52. shop and check out our
4082.76s: brand new playing cards as well as some
4084.12s: other goodies that we got prepared for
4085.48s: you join the Discord where it's free and
4087.84s: we can have these conversations check
4089.72s: out the internship folks and we'll see
4092.48s: you on the next video peace and love
